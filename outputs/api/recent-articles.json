      "title": "SimulScan and Partial Least Squares: Visualizing swallowing through functional and dynamic imaging correlations",
      "content": "Purpose: Swallowing is a complex function involving the precise coordination of muscles, nerves, and brain areas, and can be disrupted in a variety of neurological conditions. Current imaging studies to visualize the central control of swallowing cannot examine both the biomechanics of the swallow and the brain activity associated with swallow events. An updated version of SimulScan is introduced that provides high-quality and high-speed dynamic imaging, together with fMRI acquisitions, to enable data-driven analysis of swallowing function through a partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis. Methods: Integrating updated dynamic imaging approaches, SimulScan can achieve dynamic MRI at 23.75 frames per second and BOLD fMRI at a 1.6 s TR. Five subjects were recruited and scanned with SimulScan twice and with videofluoroscopy to compare the preliminary reliability of measuring swallowing biomechanics and the test-retest relationship in correlated functional and dynamic components of PLSC. Results: High reliability of biomechanical measures of swallowing were achieved across the two SimulScan runs. In addition, these showed moderate correlation with videofluorscopy measures. Correlations between dynamic and functional imaging across runs also showed high reliability indicating that SimulScan with PLSC can extract maps of linked correlations between the brain and the oropharyngeal region. Conclusion: The updated version of SimulScan with PLSC analysis enables the study of central control of swallowing, providing simultaneous biomechanical visualization of the swallow along with brain functional signals.",

      "title": "Symmetry breaking and avalanche shapes in modular neural networks",
      "content": "Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson-Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (SL and SH) and \"broken symmetry\" (B1, B2, ...) phases. The phase SL (SH) is characterized by the same low (high) activity in all the modules, while the Bm phases are characterized by a high activity in m modules and low activity in the remaining modules. Between SL and SH, and between SL and B1, there are two lines of critical points, where the system shows a critical behaviour, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Along these lines, avalanche shapes differ systematically: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the SL-SH transition, but can become left-skewed over intermediate durations along the SL-B1 critical line. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.",

      "title": "The Impact of Different Learning Processes on Acquisition, Transfer, and Proprioception in Complex Motor Tasks",
      "content": "Motor skill learning involves multiple mechanisms, including use-dependent learning (UDL), reinforcement learning (RL), and error-based learning (EBL). These operate over different time scales and neural pathways, contributing uniquely to skill acquisition, consolidation, and transfer. Here we asked how these mechanisms support the acquisition of a spatially complex maze navigation task in five groups of healthy young adults. Groups received one of five types of feedback during training of their unseen dominant hand: UDL (no feedback), RL (binary success/failure feedback with a static threshold), RLA (binary feedback with an adaptive threshold), RLB (binary feedback with adaptive threshold and brief flash of cursor feedback), or EBL (continuous real-time cursor feedback). Skill, transfer, and proprioceptive acuity were assessed pre- and post- training using a speed-accuracy function (SAF) for each hand and a two-alternative forced-choice shape discrimination task. Results showed that UDL and RL groups exhibited no improvement post-training, while EBL, RLA, and RLB groups demonstrated accuracy improvements. EBL and RLB participants experienced a significant reduction in movement variability, with EBL showing a greater decrease compared to UDL. The left-hand SAF revealed improvements in accuracy across all groups except UDL. All groups showed reduced variability in the left hand, suggesting intermanual transfer, with EBL transferring more variability improvements than UDL. No significant proprioceptive changes were observed in any group. These findings provide new insights into motor skill learning, emphasizing that even minimal feedback can facilitate complex skill acquisition and transfer and has significant implications for studies where error-based learning may not be applicable.",

      "title": "Evidence for an Active Handoff between Hemispheres during Target Tracking",
      "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

      "title": "Exposure to Bullying Engages Social Distress Circuits in the Adolescent and Adult Brain",
      "content": "<p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible \"zoom lens\" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>",

      "title": "Rebound Bursting Selectively Enables Fast Dynamics in Dopamine Midbrain Neurons Projecting to the Dorsolateral Striatum",
      "content": "<p>Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons are involved in a wide array of key brain functions including movement control and reward-based learning. They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<sub>v</sub>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>",

      "title": "Linking Connectivity Dynamics to Symptom Severity and Cognitive Abilities in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An FNIRS Study",
      "content": "<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Lateral Na+ Diffusion in Apical Dendrites of Mouse CA1 Pyramidal Neurons",
      "content": "<p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <i>D</i><sub>Na+</sub> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>",

      "content": "<p>BLTP1 (Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Protein Family Member 1), previously known as Tweek, Kiaa1109, FSA, or 4932438A13Rik, is a nonvesicular lipid transport protein linked to Alkuraya&ndash;Ku&#x010d;inskas syndrome (AKS), an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. Although BLTP1 is known to be involved in the transfer of phospholipids between organellar membranes at membrane contact sites, its specific role during mammalian development remains poorly defined. Here we characterized the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <i>Bltp1</i> knock-out (<i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i>) mice of either sex. These mutant mice die perinatally, exhibiting reduced growth of intramuscular motor nerves and a reduction in the size of the NMJ, compared with littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>",

      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",
