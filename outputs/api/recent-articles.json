      "content": "<p>Hello HN,<p>I\u2019m Joseph, a solo developer. I built CustomPaste because I was frustrated by the binary choice standard clipboard tools give us: either keep all the messy formatting (background colors, huge fonts) or strip everything down to plain text.<p>We all know Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text), but that is often too destructive, it kills hyperlinks, bolding, and lists when I usually just want to normalize the font family (e.g., force Arial 11pt) or remove background colors.<p>I wanted a tool that let me \"strip exactly what I want, and keep exactly what I want.\"<p>The Solution: Instead of a single \"paste\" behavior, the app lets you create reusable \"Recipes\" to define exactly how your text should land in your editor. It intercepts the clipboard, processes the structure locally, and transforms it based on your rules.<p>It offers granular control over:<p><pre><code>    Smart Preservation: You can strip or set specific font families and sizes but specifically preserve bold, italics, and hyperlinks.\n</code></pre>\nStructure: You can preserve tables while stripping the images inside them.<p>Data Cleanup: It can instantly purge duplicate lines, sort lists alphabetically, or flatten extra blank lines.<p>Text Fixes: It cleans up AI-generated artifacts (like \"smart quotes\" or em-dashes) and enforces casing (Title Case, Sentence Case).<p>Privacy & Pricing: The app runs 100% locally on your machine, no cloud processing and no data harvesting. It is a one-time purchase (lifetime license), not a subscription. There is a free trial (first 100 pastes) so you can test if it fits your workflow.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the \"Recipe\" approach or any other edge cases you struggle with when pasting text!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "title": "Transcriptional Heterogeneity Reveals a Synaptic Gene Program in Developing and Adult Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells",
      "content": "Human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise early in gestation and expand broadly during cortical development, yet the extent of their heterogeneity remains poorly defined. Here, we isolated >2,300 highly pure OPCs from post-conceptional week (PCW) 17 human cortex using an optimized PDGFR-based immunopanning and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering revealed four transcriptionally distinct embryonic OPC subsets, including a previously unrecognized population that expressed genes linked to synaptic development, synaptic signaling, and neuromodulation. This subset - designated embryonic synaptic OPCs (eSyn-OPCs) - comprised approximately 28.5% of all embryonic OPCs in the cortex and was characterized by robust expression of synapse-associated secreted factors (THBS2, WNT5A, WNT7A, PLAT, ACHE) and multiple neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Histological analyses across PCW 12-22 demonstrated that eSyn-OPCs first appear around PCW 15 and are enriched in proliferative germinal zones. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed their localization near neural stem and progenitor cells, suggesting proximal neuron-OPC communication during early cortical assembly. Purified eSyn-OPCs differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, confirming their oligodendrocyte lineage identity. Reanalysis of adult human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets uncovered a transcriptionally analogous OPC subset (adult synaptic OPCs, aSyn-OPCs), though with reduced representation of structural synaptic genes and neurotransmitter receptor diversity compared to eSyn-OPCs. Together, these results identify a synaptically specialized OPC population in both developing and adult human cortex and reveal that eSyn-OPCs possess unexpectedly rich synaptic signaling machinery. These findings suggest that human OPCs may participate directly in neuron-glia communication during early cortical development and raise the possibility of developmental stage-specific roles for eSyn-OPCs in shaping neural circuit formation.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",
