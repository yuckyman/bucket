      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Background/Objectives: The spinal cord is a critical component of the central nervous system that transmits neural signals between the brain and the body's peripheral regions through its nerve roots. Despite being partially protected by the vertebral column, the spinal cord remains highly vulnerable to trauma, tumors, infections, and degenerative or inflammatory disorders. These conditions can disrupt neural conduction, resulting in severe functional impairments, such as paralysis, motor...",

      "content": "The poultry red mite (PRM) feeds on hens' blood at night, disrupting sleep, harming welfare, and reducing productivity. Effective control may lie in dynamic Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which relies on routine monitoring and adaptation to farm conditions. This study investigated how PRM infestations affect the night-time activity of hens. Three groups of eight hens, housed in enriched cages, were monitored with night-vision cameras over a two-month period, both before and after artificial...",

Therefore, this review aimed to assess the effectiveness of EOs against Gram-positive ESKAPE pathogens, and to evaluate their safety and toxicity in mammalian cells. (2) Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. (3) Results: Heracleum pyrenaicum exhibited the most potent effect, with a MIC of...",

      "content": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant promise as energy-efficient alternatives to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, SNNs require computations across multiple timesteps, resulting in increased latency, heightened energy consumption, and additional memory access overhead. Techniques to reduce SNN latency down to a unit timestep have emerged to realize true superior energy efficiency over ANNs. Nonetheless, this latency reduction often comes at the expense of...",
