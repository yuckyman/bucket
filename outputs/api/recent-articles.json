      "title": "A Gata4-Loxl2 Axis Controls ECM Remodeling to Enable Scar-Free Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury in mammals causes permanent loss of sensory and motor function due to scar formation obstructing axon regrowth. In contrast, zebrafish fully regenerate their spinal cord without lasting fibrosis. Here, we identify the transcription factor Gata4 as a key positive regulator of regeneration. After injury, gata4 expression is predominantly upregulated in ependymo-radial glial cells and in glial cells extending processes toward sites of tissue bridging. Gata4 preserves glial identity and orchestrates regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Gata4 loss biases glial cells toward a fibroblast-like state with upregulated Loxl2b, a collagen cross-linking enzyme, and can also increase Loxl2b in nearby non-glial cells. Excess Loxl2b activity promotes pathological crosslinking and formation of a rigid, fibrotic matrix impairing glial and axonal bridging across the lesion, greatly reducing motor recovery. Pharmacological inhibition of Loxl2b in gata4 mutants substantially rescues ECM organization, tissue bridging, and functional recovery. Injury-induced gata4 expression depends, at least in part, on Hif1 signaling and activation of a short injury responsive enhancer. We identify the Gata4 Loxl2b axis as a central regulator of and potential therapeutic target for scar-free spinal cord repair.",

      "title": "Show HN: BrowserOS \u2013 \"Claude Cowork\" in the browser",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We're an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company/sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we're launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn't plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>--- The architectural bet we made 9 months ago<p>Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn't smooth.<p>We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls:<p>1) JS service worker is single-threaded, so we couldn't start multiple agents in parallel.<p>2) Not having access to a NodeJS-like runtime meant we couldn't use many great npm packages (Vercel AI SDK, etc)<p>So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything we built and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https://git.new/browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://git.new/browseros-agent</a><p>--- How we gave browser access to filesystem<p>When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there's no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first.<p>But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>--- What you can actually do today<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven't tried us since the last Show HN, give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we've grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/5nevh00lckM</a><p>e) You can also schedule repetitive tasks!<p>--- Why we think browser is the right platform<p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. One example: Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we're adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): \"role(agent): can never click buy\" or \"role(agent): read-only access on my bank's homepage.\" We have a prototype already\u2014curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We\u2019ll be in the comments.

      "title": "A genetically defined midbrain-pontine circuit gates vocal communication",
      "content": "Vocal communication is selectively expressed in social and emotional contexts, suggesting the presence of neural substrates that gate the conversion of internal states into vocal motor output. Although the periaqueductal gray (PAG) is known to be essential for vocalization, the genetic identity and circuit logic of the neurons that initiate and shape vocal signals remain unclear. Here, we identify a genetically defined population of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG SST ) that functions as a premotor gate for ultrasonic vocalizations in mice. In vivo calcium imaging shows that l/vlPAG SST neurons are selectively recruited around vocal onset. Manipulating l/vlPAG SST neuron activity bidirectionally regulates vocal output: activation prolongs call duration by coordinating respiratory, laryngeal, and orofacial motor programs, whereas silencing suppresses courtship vocalizations. Projection specific manipulations further demonstrate that descending glutamatergic, but not neuropeptidergic, output from l/vlPAG SST neurons to the dorsal pontine tegmentum is sufficient to drive vocal production. Together, these findings define a genetically specified midbrain pontine circuit that gates vocal communication and provides prospective access for linking internal conditions to vocal expressions.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>AstrolaDB is a schema-first tooling language \u2014 not an ORM. You define your schema once, and it can automatically generate:</p> <p>- Database migrations </p> <p>- OpenAPI / GraphQL specs </p> <p>- Multi-language types for Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust</p> <p>For Python developers, this means you can keep your models, database, and API specs in sync without manually duplicating definitions. It reduces boilerplate and makes multi-service workflows more consistent.</p> <p>repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/hlop3z/astroladb\">https://github.com/hlop3z/astroladb</a></p> <p>docs: <a href=\"https://hlop3z.github.io/astroladb/\">https://hlop3z.github.io/astroladb/</a></p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>AstrolaDB is mainly aimed at:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Backend developers using Python (or multiple languages) who want type-safe workflows \u2022 Teams building APIs and database-backed applications that need consistent schemas across services \u2022 People curious about schema-first design and code generation for real-world projects </code></pre> <p>It\u2019s still early, so this is for experimentation and feedback rather than production-ready adoption.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most Python tools handle one piece of the puzzle: ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM manage queries and migrations but don\u2019t automatically generate API specs or multi-language types.</p> <p>AstrolaDB tries to combine these concerns around a single schema, giving a unified source of truth without replacing your ORM or query logic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ixatrap\"> /u/ixatrap </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qj6sz5/astroladb_schemafirst_tooling_for_databases_apis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qj6sz5/astroladb_schemafirst_tooling_for_databases_apis/\">[comments]</a></span>",
