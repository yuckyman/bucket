      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Contextual associations impact visual search across multiple processing stages",
      "content": "Growing evidence indicates that visual search is influenced not only by perceptual but also by semantic information. Among such semantic influences, categorical effects have been extensively studied. By contrast, the influence of contextual associations, that is, how objects commonly co-occur within specific scene contexts, remains less understood. Here, we orthogonally manipulated contextual and categorical relationships between target and distractor objects in a visual search task, while controlling for perceptual target-distractor similarity. By applying linear regression analyses, we modelled behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from contextual, categorical, and perceptual target-distractor similarity. We found that contextual associations guide attention independently during early processing (modulating the N1pc ERP component), subsequently interact with categorical information (modulating the N2pc), and ultimately shape behavioral search performance jointly with perceptual and categorical similarity. These findings demonstrate that contextual object associations influence visual search across multiple processing stages, thereby supporting attentional guidance in everyday visual tasks.",

      "content": "Many studies have analyzed what organizational features distinguish the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, with most differences typically being found in language areas. In this analysis, we test whether supervised learning can categorize an unseen hemisphere as right or left based on functional connectivity. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we find success to be extremely high (accuracies > .90) in right-handed participants (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [EHI] > 0). Accuracies are still high, but slightly lower when trained on left-handed participants (EHI <= 0). In a third analysis, we test whether the same can be done to identify handedness along with hemisphere chirality. This does not succeed, however, we show that individuals' hemispheres are less distinct the more left-handed they are. Our findings can inform developmental and post-injury work on hemispheric organization.",

      "title": "Striatal pathology in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 mice: A comparative study with Huntingtons disease",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntingtons disease (HD), are motor diseases caused by CAG expansions in ATXN1 and HTT, where SCA1 shows prominent cerebellar neurodegeneration and HD shows prominent striatal neurodegeneration, particularly in the Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs). Since human and mouse studies demonstrate progressive striatal vulnerability in SCA1, we examined age-dependent molecular, cellular and functional striatal attributes in SCA1 (f-ATXN1146Q/2Q) knockin mice, by assessing RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. Striatal mRNAs are downregulated in SCA1 mice, many in common with HD mice, and specificity in MSNs is supported by the rescue of transcriptomic dysregulation with deletion of mutant Ataxin1 from MSNs. Immunohistochemistry assessed dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R) expression in indirect and direct MSNs. In HD mice (HttQ175/Q7), expression of both D1R and D2R proteins in MSNs decreased with age in parallel with their RNA levels. In the SCA1 mouse striatum, D1R protein expression decreased with age as seen in murine HD striatum. In contrast, while D2R protein level was decreased similar to D1R protein at 5-weeks of age, by 40-weeks expression of D2R protein recovered to levels recorded in WT mice. Electrophysiological assessment showed a reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission in SCA1 mouse MSNs, indicating functional deficits early in disease. In contrast to cerebellar and many other aspects of SCA1 pathology known to depend on proper nuclear localization of ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine, mutating ATXN1s nuclear localization failed to correct striatal MSN RNA and protein downregulations, indicating a difference in how ATXN1 exerts its pathological effects between the cerebellum and the striatum. Together, these data provide a molecular and cellular basis of striatal pathology in SCA1.",

      "content": "Silent visual reading is accompanied by the phenomenological experience of an inner voice. However, the temporal dynamics and functional role of the underlying neural representations remain unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data while humans read naturalistic narratives, and applied computational modelling to isolate time-resolved auditory from visual and semantic representations. Our results revealed robust auditory representations during silent reading that were not explained by visual or semantic features, emerging already before word onset. These auditory representations mimicked the sequence of sounds of the corresponding words in a fine-grained manner, revealing a candidate basis for the phenomenological experience of hearing an inner voice while reading. Finally, we show that auditory word representations exhibit a key signature of predictive processing: they are stronger for unexpected than expected words. More specifically, early auditory features contribute to predictions before word onset, whereas later features only contribute after word onset, suggesting distinct prediction stages. Together our results reveal the temporal dynamics and functional role of auditory representations in silent reading.",

      "title": "Visual working memory representations of naturalistic images in early visual cortex are not sensory-like",
      "content": "For a long time, working memory was considered to reflect sustained activity in prefrontal and parietal areas. This has been challenged by the \"sensory recruitment model\" according to which sensory areas are involved in maintaining working memory representations. The main support for this comes from the finding that working memory contents can be decoded from early sensory areas during memory delay periods. However, the availability of stimulus-related information in sensory regions does not reveal whether this information is encoded in a sensory format, i.e. in the same way as sensory stimuli. Alternatively, working memory contents could be encoded in independent formats or even potentially undergo dynamic changes throughout the delay. Here, we test this question directly by requiring participants to briefly memorise naturalistic object-scenes. We directly compared the way early visual regions encoded the contents during perception and working memory maintenance. As in previous studies, we found robust stimulus-related information in early visual cortex throughout the delay. However, despite continuously robust information, the encoding of memory contents in the later delay period did not occur in the same format as during pure perception. Thus, despite the fact that sensory areas have working-memory-related information, the format of this information is not strictly sensory-like throughout the delay.",

      "title": "Cell-type Specific Extracellular Vesicles in Mouse Brain: Proteomic Signatures Highlight Astrocytic GlialCAM Network and GPCR Enrichment",
      "content": "Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) and are emerging as biomarkers of brain health and disease. However, the molecular composition of cell type-specific brain EVs, particularly astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs), remains poorly defined. Methods: We performed comparative proteomic analysis of neuronal (NDEVs), microglial (MDEVs), and astrocytic (ADEVs) from mouse brain using magnetic immunocapture and LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. Results: Each EV subtype displayed distinct molecular fingerprints. NDEVs were enriched in synaptic proteins and neurogenesis-related proteins (e.g., APP and BDNF), whereas MDEVs contained immune and phagocytic markers (e.g., CX3CR1). Strikingly, the ADEV proteome closely mirrored the recently characterized GlialCAM interactome from leukodystrophy research, encompassing GlialCAM/MLC1 and associated partners involved in ion and water homeostasis (EAAT1/2, AQP4, GJA1), together with GPCRs such as GPRC5B. This overlap suggests that ADEVs encapsulate a molecular scaffold characteristic of astrocytic endfeet, potentially extending their signaling functions to the extracellular space. Conclusion: Our study provides a detailed comparative proteomic characterization of brain cell-type specific EVs, revealing that ADEVs contain the GlialCAM/MLC1 network and GPCRs. These findings position ADEVs as promising candidates for EV-based biomarkers and mechanistic studies in CNS disorders.",

      "content": "Human speech carries information beyond the words themselves: pitch, loudness, duration, and pauses--jointly referred to as 'prosody'--emphasize critical words, help group words into phrases, and convey emotional and other socially-relevant information. Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identify a set of prosody-responsive brain areas and then richly characterize them across 8 experiments (25 experimental conditions; n=51 participants). These areas--located on the lateral temporal surface bilaterally and in the frontal lobe--respond to the presence of prosody in both meaningful and meaningless speech, and are distinct from nearby temporal pitch- and speech-perception areas and from frontal areas sensitive to general cognitive and attentional demands. They are also dissociable from--but show partial overlap with--the language areas and with the area that processes dynamic facial expressions. Thus, prosodic information is processed by a distinct set of brain areas, which may help integrate linguistic meanings with non-verbal communicative signals.",

      "title": "Degraded sensory coding in a mouse model of Scn2a-related disorder and its rescue by CRISPRa gene activation",
      "content": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN2A, a sodium channel gene expressed in cortical pyramidal (PYR) cells, lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, and cortical sensory dysfunction. In Scn2a+/- mice, PYR dendritic excitability and synapses are impaired, but cortical information processing deficits are unknown. In the whisker somatosensory cortex, we found strongly degraded somatotopic tuning of PYR cells, profoundly blurred whisker maps, and impaired population coding, despite normal overall firing rates. This constitutes a robust biomarker for Scn2a-related cortical dysfunction. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were also unexpectedly hypofunctional. We tested for rescue of coding deficits in post-critical period, young adult mice by viral delivery of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) reagents that upregulate Scn2a. CRISPRa treatment normalized cortical sensory representations at the single-unit and map levels. This suggests that therapy to increase Scn2a expression may be effective in normalizing cortical function in Scn2a loss-of-function disorder, even in older children or adults.",

      "title": "The hierarchical organization of human praxis: A lesion-connectome mapping study of limb and oral apraxias",
      "content": "The neural architecture underlying apraxias remains a complex puzzle. While primary motor cortices exhibit clear somatotopic organization, it is unclear whether this segregation extends to the higher-order networks governing skilled actions. Furthermore, the dissociation between verbal (apraxia of speech, AOS) and non-verbal (buccofacial apraxia, BFA) oral motor control remains debated. We investigated the neuroanatomical substrates of limb apraxia (LA), BFA, and AOS in 136 patients with acute left-hemisphere ischemic stroke using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based, and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping. Our results revealed a fundamental anatomical dissociation extending beyond simple effector specificity. LA was associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobule and widespread white matter disconnections, specifically involving intra-hemispheric temporo-parietal pathways and massive inter-hemispheric transcallosal fibers. In contrast, BFA was attributable to focal cortical lesions centered on the ventral precentral and postcentral gyri, without significant involvement of long-range white matter tracts. AOS showed no significant lesion overlap at the population level, suggesting a highly focal etiology distinct from the premotor patterns of BFA. These findings indicate that LA and BFA differ not only in their effectors but in their network dependency: LA relies on a distributed, bilaterally integrated temporo-parietal network for multimodal action control, whereas BFA depends on localized proprioceptive-motor loops in the ventral sensorimotor cortex. This study provides a structural framework for the hierarchical organization of human praxis, distinguishing between distributed network disconnections and focal cortical dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Conserved phenotype and function of human brain border-associated macrophages in iPSC-derived models",
      "content": "Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) are increasingly implicated in protective brain functions including the removal of pathogenic material such as amyloid-beta. However, there is a lack of available and deeply characterized human BAM models. Here, we report that postnatal transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hematopoietic progenitors to the murine brain sufficiently chimerizes the brain border immune compartment to allow functional interrogations. Human xenotransplanted BAMs (xBAMs) line the leptomeninges and brain vasculature beyond the glia limitans. Via single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that a conserved transcriptional signature distinguishes BAMs from microglia across species origin, age, and genetic background. Both xBAMs and murine BAMs are defined by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and function, surpass other brain macrophages in acute amyloid-beta scavenging, and exhibit compartment-restricted sampling of parenchymal material. Using a modified differentiation protocol, we find that we can generate iPS-derived BAM-like cells (iBAMs) in vitro, which are also characterized by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and enhanced engulfment capacity relative to iPS-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs). Together, these data define a conserved hyper-endocytic BAM phenotype and provide a toolbox for studying human BAMs both in vivo and in vitro.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>!</p> <p>I just built and released a new open-source project: <strong>Pydantic-DeepAgents</strong> \u2013 a Python Deep Agent framework built on top of Pydantic-AI.</p> <p>Check out the repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents</a></p> <p>Stars, forks, and PRs are welcome if you're interested!</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> Pydantic-DeepAgents is a framework that enables developers to rapidly build and deploy production-grade autonomous AI agents. It extends Pydantic-AI by providing advanced agent capabilities such as planning, filesystem operations, subagent delegation, and customizable skills. Agents can process tasks autonomously, handle file uploads, manage long conversations through summarization, and support human-in-the-loop workflows. It includes multiple backends for state management (e.g., in-memory, filesystem, Docker sandbox), rich toolsets for tasks like to-do lists and skills, structured outputs via Pydantic models, and full streaming support for responses.</p> <p>Key features include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Multiple Backends</strong>: StateBackend (in-memory), FilesystemBackend, DockerSandbox, CompositeBackend</li> <li><strong>Rich Toolsets</strong>: TodoToolset, FilesystemToolset, SubAgentToolset, SkillsToolset</li> <li><strong>File Uploads</strong>: Upload files for agent processing with run_with_files() or deps.upload_file()</li> <li><strong>Skills System</strong>: Extensible skill definitions with markdown prompts</li> <li><strong>Structured Output</strong>: Type-safe responses with Pydantic models via output_type</li> <li><strong>Context Management</strong>: Automatic conversation summarization for long sessions</li> <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong>: Built-in support for human confirmation workflows</li> <li><strong>Streaming</strong>: Full streaming support for agent responses</li> </ul> <p>I've also included a demo application built on this framework \u2013 check out the full app example in the repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app</a></p> <p>Plus, here's a quick demo video: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing&amp;referrer=grok.com\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>And don't miss the screenshot in the README for a visual overview!</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> Compared to popular open-source agent frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI, Pydantic-DeepAgents is more tightly integrated with Pydantic for type-safe, structured data handling, making it lighter-weight and easier to extend for production use. Unlike AutoGen (which focuses on multi-agent collaboration), it emphasizes deep agent features like customizable skills and backends (e.g., Docker sandbox for isolation), while avoiding the complexity of larger ecosystems. It's an extension of Pydantic-AI, so it inherits its simplicity but adds agent-specific tools that aren't native in base Pydantic-AI or simpler libraries like Semantic Kernel.</p> <p>Thanks! \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VanillaOk4593\"> /u/VanillaOk4593 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",
