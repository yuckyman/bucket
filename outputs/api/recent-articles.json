      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Myelin maintenance and addition regulate synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse cortex",
      "content": "Myelination of the developing central nervous system (CNS) increases action potential conduction velocity but can also act as a plasticity brake, limiting neurite reorganisation and synaptic plasticity. As myelination is a life-long process, the myelin laid down in development or adulthood could also affect synapse number or plasticity across the lifespan. We report that conditionally deleting the transcription factor, myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), to disrupt the myelin maintenance program in oligodendrocytes (OLs) from P57 (Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice), led to significant myelin loss and impaired action potential conduction and gross motor performance. By sparsely labelling layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, we could visualise the apical and basal dendrites and their excitatory post-synaptic dendritic spines and determined that spine density was normal in P57+60 Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice. However, a higher proportion of the dendritic spines were large, stable mushroom spines and generated larger amplitude miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents. These data indicate that the myelin maintenance program is critical for preserving neuron adaptability, homeostasis and glutamate sensitivity. When we instead prevented the addition of new OLs and myelin from P57, action potential conduction velocity and gross motor performance appeared normal. Spine density was also normal in Pdgfr-CreERTM :: Myrf fl/fl mice, however, spine morphology was changed along the basal dendrites of layer V M1 pyramidal neurons. At P117, the basal dendrites were frozen in a state that resembled P57 dendrites, as they retained a higher proportion of thin, plastic spines. These data suggest that adult myelination supports the life-long accumulation of stable spines within the basal but not apical dendritic compartment and have important implications for understanding dendritic plasticity rules in the motor circuit.",

      "title": "Languages of the brain: fMRI dissection of the amodal networks for language, mathematics, and social knowledge",
      "content": "The ability to compose complex mental representations by recombining simpler primitives is a characteristic of the human brain that manifests itself in a variety of domains such as spoken or written language, mathematics, or social reasoning. While it is known that these domains rest on partially distinct brain networks, they are rarely investigated together in the same paradigm. Here, we present a systematic functional MRI study of written and spoken word and sentence processing in each of these domains. In a true-false judgment task, adult participants were presented with a hierarchy of meaningless and meaningful stimuli bearing on various domains of general semantic knowledge and mathematics. The results show that distinct brain regions are activated by (1) syntax and semantics; (2) math versus non-math knowledge; (3) different domains of mathematics, such as geometry versus arithmetic; (4) social knowledge versus other knowledge. All of these regions are activated essentially identically in the written and spoken modalities. The results were replicated in a group of adolescents. Our experiments show that the human brain comprises distinct amodal networks for various domains of linguistic and semantic knowledge, and provide a simple paradigm to dissect them within a short fMRI session.",

      "title": "Salient auditory stimuli evoke spatially segregated phasic and sustained neural responses in the human brain",
      "content": "Salient sensory stimuli are known to evoke neural activations across distributed brain regions. However, the temporal dynamics of these responses over sub-second timescales remain poorly understood, in part due to limitations in the temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging methods. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activations evoked by salient sensory stimuli (rare sounds) using 1,194 widely distributed intracranial electrodes in 5 neurosurgical patients. Salient stimuli preferentially activated 263 of 1,194 electrodes (22%), with responses segregating into two largely distinct spatiotemporal patterns: (1) phasic activation in sensorimotor regions, and (2) sustained activation within the salience network. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that phasic sensorimotor activation preceded sustained salience network activation on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings support an updated view of salience processing in the human brain, revealing that salient stimuli evoke two sequential stages of neural activation - phasic sensorimotor responses followed by sustained salience network activity - rather than simultaneous widespread activation.",

      "content": "BRD1 is an epigenetic regulator implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, yet its role in human neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts early neuronal programming, resulting in accelerated maturation and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in human induced glutamatergic neurons. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early shift toward neuronal identity, characterized by downregulation of pluripotency markers and persistent upregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly and organization, including GRIA3. Despite this, BRD1+/- neurons form significantly smaller synapses and display increased neuronal activity. Our findings highlight BRD1 as a key regulator of neurodevelopmental timing and synaptic maturation, and network activity reinforcing growing evidence that disruptions in chromatin-mediated control of differentiation and synaptic organization contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Sex differences in the neural circuitry of aggression",
      "content": "The social behavior neural network (SBNN) is a circuit composed of reciprocally connected limbic structures that regulate a range of social behaviors, including aggression. Although both males and females of many species display aggressive behavior, studies of the neural circuitry underlying aggression have focused almost exclusively on males. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in neuronal activation of the neural circuitry controlling aggression in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We employed c-Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify neuronal activation following aggressive encounters between same-sex male and female dyads. Animals were tested in their home cage either alone (n=7 per sex) or with a same-sex, non-aggressive intruder (n=7 per sex) for 10 minutes. Our data revealed substantial sex differences in the neuronal activation of the SBNN following aggression. In some regions, neuronal activity changed in opposite directions in males and females compared to controls (e.g., posterior lateral septum), while in others, there was a change in neuronal activation in only one sex (e.g., medial amygdala). These findings support the hypothesis that the neural circuitry regulating aggression exhibits marked sexual differentiation.",

      "title": "Dynamic Reversal of IT-PFC Information Flow Orchestrates Visual Categorization Under Perceptual Uncertainty",
      "content": "Categorization relies on a dynamic interplay between sensory representation and cognitive control, yet the classical view posits a fixed, feed-forward (FF) information flow from Inferotemporal (IT) to Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Whether and how this hierarchical directionality adapts to cognitive context, such as perceptual certainty, remains a fundamental question. We investigated this question in monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-category task using intracranial recording and a novel connectivity analysis: Model-Based Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA). This approach allowed us to simultaneously track the content, timing, and directionality of information flow between IT and PFC, while controlling for common task-general representations. Our Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) revealed that while both areas rapidly encoded the task-relevant information, IT coding was earlier and transient, whereas PFC exhibited stronger, sustained coding and content-specific recurrence during the memory delay, reflecting active maintenance of the category rule. Crucially, the directionality of information flow was highly modulated by stimulus certainty. For high-certainty stimuli (Far from the category boundary), we observed the classical, predicted feed-forward flow (IT -> PFC). However, for low-certainty stimuli (Close to the category boundary), this hierarchy dynamically reversed, with a dominant, early feedback (FB) flow (PFC -> IT), preceding the feed-forward sweep. This FB signal carried information related to the ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a top-down mechanism to enhance sensory representations. These results challenge fixed-hierarchy models of categorization, providing mechanistic evidence that the brain dynamically reconfigures the direction of information flow between sensory and executive areas as a function of perceptual difficulty. We propose that the PFC initiates a top-down biasing signal to IT when sensory evidence is ambiguous, thus serving as an adaptive, context-driven control mechanism.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "title": "The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test for adults: A refined version in Spanish.",
      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "An open-source system for recording the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and an example application in mice with hearing loss",
      "content": "The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of the neurophysiological response to sound, widely used in clinical and research settings. In this manuscript, we describe an open-source and low-cost system suitable for measuring the ABR in mice. (This system is not evaluated or approved for clinical use in humans.) The heart of the system is the commercially available Texas Instruments ADS1299 chip, which is designed for multi-channel differential recording of biosignals. We designed auxiliary hardware and software to record and visualize the ABR. To demonstrate that this system is capable of high-quality and low-noise measurements, we recorded the response to free-field auditory clicks from the left and right. Next, we compared different electrode configurations, quantified the most consistent aspects of the ABR, and assessed variability within and across mice. Finally, we demonstrated how to detect the decreased auditory sensitivity caused by surgically induced conductive hearing loss. Users can deploy this open-source system at low cost and customize it for different applications, such as recording other biosignals like electromyography (EMG) or electrocardiography (ECG).",
