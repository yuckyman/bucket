      "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
      "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.01453v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although birthed in the era of teletypes, the command line shell survived the graphical interface revolution of the 1980's and lives on in modern desktop operating systems. The command line provides access to powerful functionality not otherwise exposed on the computer, but requires users to recall textual syntax and carefully scour documentation. In contrast, graphical interfaces let users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command line tasks.",

Common shapes such as Cartesian planes and flowcharts can be used not only to explain conceptual contributions, but to think through and refine the contribution itself. Yet, theory figures tend to be limited to a set of standard shapes, limiting the creative and expressive potential of visualization theory. In this work, we explore how the shapes used in theory figures afford different understandings and explanations of their underlying phenomena. We speculate on the value of visualizing theories using more expressive configurations, such as icebergs, horseshoes, M\\\"obius strips, and BLT sandwiches. By reflecting on figure-making's generative role in the practice of theorizing, we conclude that theory is, in fact, shapes.",

Government issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static, dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout, an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and regulatory frameworks.

      "content": "arXiv:2510.01194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.01192v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect. Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving empathetic qualities.",

We introduce an open-source, low-cost, precise, non-invasive, and biocompatible jaw tracking system based on optical motion capture technology to address the need for accessible and adaptable research tools. The system encompasses a complete pipeline from data acquisition, processing, and kinematic analysis to filtering, visualization, and data storage.

The system demonstrated reliable kinematic tracking with an estimated precision of $(182 \\pm 47) {\\mu}m$ and $(0.126 \\pm 0.034) {\\deg}$. Therefore, the open-source nature of the system and its utility comparable to commercial systems make it suitable for many research and development contexts, especially for applications such as the integration and design of jaw exoskeletons and customized diagnostic protocols.

Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized LLM (\"GPT Anthropologist\"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software development.",

To investigate this experience, we conducted a longitudinal observational study with 61 students across 16 design teams. Over five months of weekly diary-interviews, we uncovered the intricate dynamics of co-exploration. Our main contribution is a four-dimensional framework that identifies five distinct patterns of co-exploration activities. Our findings reveal how co-exploration emerges across various activities throughout the design process, demonstrating its role in different team interactions. It fosters a sense of togetherness, keeping design teams open-minded and engaged. This engagement cultivates collective intelligence, enabling teams to actively share knowledge, build upon each other's ideas, and achieve outcomes beyond individual contributions. Our study underscores the value of co-exploration, suggesting that it reflects the trajectory of design success and warrants further research.

      "content": "arXiv:2510.01187v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many STEM concepts pose significant learning challenges to students due to their inherent complexity and abstract nature. Visualizing complex problems through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device. Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.",

      "content": "arXiv:2502.15440v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice.

      "content": "arXiv:2510.02120v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.",

      "title": "Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01986v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development. However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.\n  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator with participants exposed to passive driving.\n  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.\n  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.01858v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning. Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks. This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid compositional meta-learning.",

      "title": "Uncovering Semantic Selectivity of Latent Groups in Higher Visual Cortex with Mutual Information-Guided Diffusion",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.02182v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.",

      "title": "A Modular Theory of Subjective Consciousness for Natural and Artificial Minds",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01864v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience. Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules (abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop. This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure. Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature of complex information processing.",

      "title": "Promoting arm movement practice with a novel wheelchair armrest early after stroke: A randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01753v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Chronic upper extremity (UE) impairment is common after stroke. This study evaluated Boost, a novel wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device designed to assist individuals in UE motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation. Thirty-five stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional UE exercises alongside standard therapy, using either Boost or a therapist-customized booklet for self-practice. Outcomes included the UE Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) Exam, Box and Block Test, Motor Activity Log, Modified Ashworth Scale, shoulder subluxation, and shoulder pain. At baseline, mean days post-stroke were 11.9$\\pm$4.6 and 13.1$\\pm$5.9, and UEFM scores were 20.5$\\pm$10.1 and 21.0$\\pm$13.5. Intervention durations averaged 11.9$\\pm$4.0 and 17.2$\\pm$8.8 days, respectively. Participants in the Boost group completed 3,359$\\pm$3,137 additional arm movements. No significant between-group differences were found at the three-month follow-up. However, the Boost group showed a trend toward greater UEFM improvement immediately post-intervention (11.8 vs. 6.9 points, p=0.06). Importantly, UEFM gains were predicted by the number of Boost exercises performed (p=0.02, R-square=0.34). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with less severe impairment (baseline UEFM >21) achieved significantly greater UEFM improvements at discharge with Boost compared to controls (15.8 vs. 7.8 points, p=0.01). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving thousands of additional UE practice movements while seated in a wheelchair without direct supervision during subacute rehabilitation. The added movement practice was well tolerated and may offer short-term impairment-reduction benefits, particularly in those with less severe impairment. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy, establish optimal dosage, and determine long-term clinical and functional benefits of Boost-assisted therapy.",
