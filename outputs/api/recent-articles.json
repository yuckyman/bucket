      "title": "Whole-Brain Convergence of Real-World Visual Expertise beyond Faces: Meta-Analytic Evidence for Core-Adaptive Neural Architecture",
      "content": "Visual expertise-the ability to discriminate highly similar exemplars quickly and accurately within a category-supports skilled performance across real-world domains and is supported by distributed neural systems. We focus on non-face expertise to test cross-domain convergence in acquired real-world visual skills, treating faces separately because socially embedded, sensitive-period-constrained processing could blur this inference. It remains unresolved whether non-face expertise across heterogeneous domains converges on a shared, domain-general whole-brain architecture, or instead recruits domain-contingent neural configurations that vary with task and stimulus demands. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 task-fMRI studies spanning 11 real-world non-face expertise domains (579 participants, 210 peak-activation foci). Primary analysis revealed a robust, right-lateralized parieto-temporo-occipital circuit centered on the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and adjoining inferior parietal lobule. We propose that this circuit constitutes a domain-general neural core that integrates fine-grained visual features with semantic associations while supporting attention-guided recognition of visually similar objects in expert performance. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses uncovered a complementary adaptive component, the engagement of which varied systematically with representational and contextual factors. Pictorial stimuli and expert-novice contrasts reliably strengthened recruitment of the right-hemisphere core, whereas symbolic stimuli engagement toward left temporal regions while selectively re-engaging right-core nodes. In addition, male-skewed samples showed attenuated left-hemisphere activation. Together, these findings delineate a stable right-hemisphere neural scaffold underlying non-face visual expertise, flexibly supplemented by left-hemisphere systems as a function of stimulus format, task demands, and demographic context, providing a whole-brain reference framework for future studies.",

      "title": "Injury-induced CTE-like pathology emerges in a human multicellular in vitro brain model and reveals mitochondrial and neurovascular regulation.",
      "content": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive mild head impacts, but no human-based experimental system exists to study injury-induced CTE-like pathology. Here, we establish a long-lived, human multicellular in vitro brain platform in which controlled mechanical injury induces key cellular features of CTE-like pathology. Injured cultures developed persistent tau phosphorylation, axonal degeneration, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction without widespread neuronal loss, consistent with progressive pathology rather than acute toxicity. To assess physiological relevance, we integrated transcriptomic profiles from the model with postmortem human CTE brain datasets. This analysis revealed striking convergence at the level of disease-associated modules and pathways, with endothelial cells emerging as critical contributors to CTE-like transcriptional programs. Using this human-based system, we further identified delayed mitochondrial dysfunction as a prominent and sustained feature of injury-induced pathology. Together, these findings establish the first human in vitro platform for studying injury-induced CTE-like pathology and identify neurovascular and mitochondrial regulation as central components of chronic neurodegeneration following repetitive mild brain injury.",

      "title": "The critical roaming hypothesis: arousal-driven transitions across critical lines reproduce human functional connectivity dynamics",
      "content": "Ongoing brain activity displays rich temporal variability associated with efficient cognition, with functional connectivity (FC) continually reconfiguring over time. The resulting functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) specifically show complex, fat-tailed statistics that alternate between persistent epochs and faster reconfiguration transients. While nonlinear whole-brain models tuned nearby a critical point have reproduced some aspects of FCD, they fall short of capturing its full temporal complexity. We propose that slow fluctuations in arousal offer a biologically plausible mechanism for exploring critical regimes in large-scale brain dynamics and thus enrich FCD. Using a connectome-based model of coupled cortical populations, we identified phase boundaries where system dynamics transition between regimes of faster or slower FCD. We then phenomenologically incorporated arousal changes, modeling them as stochastic fluctuations in key parameters such as cortical excitability, input gain, and noise amplitude. This non-autonomous formulation enables the system to roam dynamically across regime boundaries, flexibly tuning its distance from critical transition lines and producing intermittent transitions that mirror the stochastic evolution observed in empirical FCD. Fitting these models to human resting-state fMRI and performing model comparison, we find that arousal-driven models more accurately reproduce the distinctive quantitative features of FCD with the greatest improvements coming from the previously poorly accounted fat-tailed portions of the distributions. Together, these results suggest that arousal fluctuations - likely mediated by changes in neuromodulatory tone-- shape the brain's attractor landscape over time, expanding the repertoire of accessible functional network states and providing a mechanistic basis for the complexity of spontaneous functional dynamics.",

      "title": "The neural correlates of parallel and serial search",
      "content": "For almost half a century, target distractor similarity has been known to induce different visual search modes. When a target is highly salient, it can pop out, suggesting parallel processing of all items irrespective of set size. By contrast, high similarity among items requires item-by-item comparison with an attentional template, a characteristic of serial search. Despite this long-standing distinction, little is known about the neural correlates of search modes, as typical differences in visual displays confound interpretation. Here, we contrasted the neural correlates of serial and parallel search under visually identical displays. Across distinct blocks, we biased 24 participants (21 female) toward parallel or serial search by varying target distractor similarity, thereby directing attentional focus toward a single feature or conjunction. Embedded among inducer trials, test trials were visually identical across all blocks and afforded both parallel and serial search. Behavioral analyses confirmed successful induction of distinct search modes during test trials. EEG decoding reliably discriminated search modes and these neural patterns generalized across inducer and test trials. Attentional deployment toward the target differed across search modes, revealing topographical differences in target location representations. The strength of target-location representations correlated with response times, indicating that during parallel test trials, participants switched search strategies when the target was not detected early. Moreover, target representations diverged between search modes: a temporally stable pattern emerged during serial search, suggesting reliance on working memory, whereas parallel search was characterized by more dynamic representations, likely reflecting prioritization of the relevant feature. These findings demonstrate that search history shapes search mode, giving rise to clearly distinct neural dynamics even under visually identical stimulation.",

      "title": "Slow Spindle Trains During Daytime Naps are Associated with Improved Declarative Memory Consolidation",
      "content": "Memory consolidation refers to the process by which newly encoded memories are strengthened and retained over time, and ample evidence indicates that sleep supports this process for both procedural and declarative memories. Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2. These findings suggest the temporal organization of slow spindles into clusters support declarative memory consolidation, pointing to a shared spindle-based mechanism across domains.

      "content": "Visualizing active neurons and circuits in vivo is critical for investigating the neural activity that underlies behavior. While several established methodologies are available to achieve this end in larval zebrafish, they are limited by the scale of tissue visualization, temporal resolution, need to restrain larvae, and/or accessibility of necessary instruments. Here, we establish a pipeline for the visualization and quantification of spatiotemporally precise whole-brain neural activity in larval zebrafish using CaMPARI2, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain \"snapshots\" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning. This approach effectively complements the temporal precision achievable through post hoc activity detection methods and expands the accessibility of large-scale behavioral circuit dissection beyond highly specialized real-time volumetric imaging equipment.",

      "title": "Transcriptional Changes Fade Prior to Long-Term Memory for Sensitization of the Aplysia Siphon-Withdrawal Reflex",
      "content": "Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription. What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten? And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory? To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting. Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression. We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

      "title": "Intensity-dependent corticospinal facilitation by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation: Evidence for a major contribution of group I afferents",
      "content": "Background: Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) is increasingly used in neurorehabilitation, yet the optimal stimulation intensity for inducing corticospinal facilitation and the underlying afferent mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the intensity-dependent effects of repetitive PMS on corticospinal excitability and single motor unit responses, and tested group I afferent contribution. Methods: Healthy participants received repetitive PMS (25 Hz; 2-s ON/2-s OFF) over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) in a crossover design at 0.9x motor threshold (MT), 1.2xMT, and high intensity sufficient to induce maximal wrist dorsiflexion (mean 1.8xMT). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from the ECR and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) before and during the intervention (total 15 min). The lasting effects were assessed after 9 min of high-intensity PMS for 50 min. To examine group I afferent contribution, the same high-intensity protocol was applied during upper-arm ischemia after reducing the ECR H-reflex to <10% of baseline. Sensory-motor input characteristics across stimulation intensities were compared using post-stimulus time histograms of ECR single motor unit firings during weak voluntary contraction. Results: High-intensity PMS significantly increased ECR MEPs after 9 min of intervention, whereas 1.2xMT of PMS required 15 min to induce a marked effect. PMS at 0.9xMT did not induce significant MEP changes. Across all intensities, the FCR MEPs remained unaltered. ECR MEPs remained markedly elevated for up to 30 min after 9 min of high-intensity PMS. In contrast, PMS delivered during ischemia produced no MEP enhancement. The motor unit analysis revealed that suprathreshold PMS elicited an early peak in firing probability--consistent with monosynaptic Ia excitation--whose amplitude increased with stimulation intensity, whereas PMS at 0.9xMT produced no discernible peak. Conclusions: Repetitive PMS above MT facilitates corticospinal excitability in an intensity-dependent manner. Facilitation was abolished during ischemia. Together with the presence of a short-latency peak in motor unit firing via a monosynaptic pathway, this finding supports a major contribution of large-diameter muscle afferents, with a substantial Ia component, to PMS-induced corticospinal facilitation.",

      "title": "Investigating the mechanisms underlying saccade generation in the frontal eye fields using multi-site microstimulation",
      "content": "The frontal eye field (FEF), a region of frontal cortex, has long been associated with the cortical control of eye movements. Classically, saccades can be reliably evoked by delivering low-intensity electrical microstimulation to the FEF. Although this makes clear the importance of FEF in the descending control of eye movements, the way in which population activity in the FEF is integrated by downstream regions to generate a motor command remains a mystery. To probe these mechanisms, we used a 16-channel microelectrode array to deliver microstimulation to the FEF of two awake, behaving monkeys. First, we found that larger current intensities were required to evoke changes in saccade direction relative to saccade amplitude when single-site saccades were evoked by stimulating a single contact on the array. Second, when stimulating two contacts simultaneously to investigate how population activity in the FEF is read out, a new polar average model more accurately predicted the amplitude and direction of dual-site saccades than traditional vector sum and vector average models. Using preexisting data from the superior colliculus (SC), we found that although the polar average model was more accurate at predicting saccade amplitude in the SC, it was no more accurate than traditional models at predicting saccade direction. Finally, when stimulating two contacts in FEF simultaneously with unequal current intensities, model accuracy depended on the amplitude of the saccades evoked by stimulating each individual site alone, suggesting that the brain may flexibly combine amplitude and direction information from the FEF to generate saccadic plans.",

      "content": "Rhythmic ability is a universal aspect of human cultures and sets the basis for musical rhythm perception and synchronization. While humans can synchronize movements to complex rhythms, it is unclear whether this capability extends to our primate ancestors. In this study, we explore whether primates can synchronize to complex rhythms and acquire rhythmic representations with generalizability akin to humans. Using controlled behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that monkeys not only can synchronize to short-long or long-short rhythms but also learn representations that generalize across a wide range of rhythm ratios and total durations. These results indicate ability to flexibly represent ratios within a relative timing framework is not exclusive to humans, but it is also present in monkeys. In addition, the produced intervals show a bias towards rhythmic categories. Notably, in an iterative tapping task, macaques and humans showed large priors for isochrony and integer ratios (2:1, 3:1). These results demonstrate a common biological foundation for rhythm synchronization in primates, extending our understanding of the shared cognitive mechanisms between primates and humans, and highlight the enormous potential of using monkeys to study the neurophysiological basis of complex rhythm perception.",

I've been experimenting with DSPy beyond single-shot prompt optimization, and I built something I think the community will find interesting.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p><strong>Compounding Engineering</strong> is a local-first DSPy agent that treats your Git repository as a persistent learning environment. Instead of ephemeral prompts, it runs iterative review \u2192 triage \u2192 plan \u2192 learn cycles that compound improvements over time.</p> <h2>How It Works</h2> <ul> <li>Index your entire codebase into a local vector store (Qdrant)</li> <li>Each cycle: deep review of changes, triage issues by priority, plan fixes/features, execute via DSPy programs, store learnings</li> <li>Next iteration uses what it learned last time</li> <li>Eventually the agent meta prompts itself, improving its own DSPy signatures based on repo specific patterns</li> </ul> <h2>Why It's Different</h2> <p><strong>Compounding Engineering vs traditional code review tools:</strong> - Long horizon reasoning over repo scale tasks (not just single files) - Self improving loop: metrics track progress, failed plans become few shot examples - Runs entirely offline with no cloud dependencies - Built on DSPy signatures and optimizers for systematic improvement</p> <h2>Quick Start</h2> <p><code>bash uv tool install git+https://github.com/Strategic-Automation/dspy-compounding-engineering dspy-compounding-engineering review </code></p> <p>Full docs and architecture in the GitHub README.</p> <h2>GitHub</h2> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Strategic-Automation/dspy-compounding-engineering\">https://github.com/Strategic-Automation/dspy-compounding-engineering</a></p> <p>Would love feedback from anyone exploring agentic workflows, long context reasoning, or DSPy extensions.

Instead of relying on heavy dictionary lookups or pronunciation rules, it maps Hangul Jamo to ASCII using 3 control keys (\\backslash, ~tilde, `backtick). This ensures that encode() and decode() are 100% lossless and reversible.</p> <p>\u200bTarget Audience This is designed for developers working on NLP, Search Engine Indexing, or Database Management where data integrity is critical. It is production-ready for anyone who needs to handle Korean text data without ambiguity. It is NOT intended for language learners who want to learn pronunciation.</p> <p>\u200bComparison Existing libraries (based on the National Standard 'Revised Romanization') prioritize &quot;pronunciation,&quot; which leads to ambiguity (one-to-many mapping) and irreversibility (lossy compression). \u200bStandard RR: Hangul -&gt; Sound (Ambiguous, Gang = River/Angle+g?) \u200bKRR v2.0: Hangul -&gt; Structure (Deterministic, 1:1 Bijective mapping). \u200bIt runs in O(n) complexity and solves the &quot;N-word&quot; issue by structurally separating particles. \u200bRepo: [ <a href=\"https://github.com/R8dymade/krr-2.1\">https://github.com/R8dymade/krr-2.1</a> ]</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/R8dymade\"> /u/R8dymade </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pycqch/i_made_a_deterministic_100_reversible_korean/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pycqch/i_made_a_deterministic_100_reversible_korean/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20481v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",
