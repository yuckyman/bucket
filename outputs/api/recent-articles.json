      "title": "Case Study of GAI for Generating Novel Images for Real-World Embroidery",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.16223v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we present a case study exploring the potential use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) to address the real-world need of making the design of embroiderable art patterns more accessible. Through an auto-ethnographic case study by a disabled-led team, we examine the application of GAI as an assistive technology in generating embroidery patterns, addressing the complexity involved in designing culturally-relevant patterns as well as those that meet specific needs regarding detail and color. We detail the iterative process of prompt engineering custom GPTs tailored for producing specific visual outputs, emphasizing the nuances of achieving desirable results that align with real-world embroidery requirements. Our findings underscore the mixed outcomes of employing GAI for producing embroiderable images, from facilitating creativity and inclusion to navigating the unpredictability of AI-generated designs. Future work aims to refine GAI tools we explored for generating embroiderable images to make them more performant and accessible, with the goal of fostering more inclusion in the domains of creativity and making.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.16192v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigated auditory self-recognition boundaries using AI voice morphing technology, examining when individuals cease recognizing their own voice. Through controlled morphing between participants' voices and demographically matched targets at 1% increments using a mixed-methods design, we measured self-identification ratings and response times among 21 participants aged 18-64.\n  Results revealed a critical recognition threshold at 35.2% morphing (95% CI [31.4, 38.1]). Older participants tolerated significantly higher morphing levels before losing self-recognition ($\\beta$ = 0.617, p = 0.048), suggesting age-related vulnerabilities. Greater acoustic embedding distances predicted slower decision-making ($r \\approx 0.5-0.53, p < 0.05$), with the longest response times for cloned versions of participants' own voices.\n  Qualitative analysis revealed prosodic-based recognition strategies, universal voice manipulation discomfort, and awareness of applications spanning assistive technology to security risks. These findings establish foundational evidence for individual differences in voice morphing detection, with implications for AI ethics and vulnerable population protection as voice synthesis becomes accessible.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15905v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 204) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots \"real\" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce HealthDial, a dialogue authoring tool that helps healthcare providers and educators create virtual agents that deliver health education and counseling to patients over multiple conversations. HealthDial leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically create an initial session-based plan and conversations for each session using text-based patient health education materials as input. Authored dialogue is output in the form of finite state machines for virtual agent delivery so that all content can be validated and no unsafe advice is provided resulting from LLM hallucinations. LLM-drafted dialogue structure and language can be edited by the author in a no-code user interface to ensure validity and optimize clarity and impact. We conducted a feasibility and usability study with counselors and students to test our approach with an authoring task for cancer screening education. Participants used HealthDial and then tested their resulting dialogue by interacting with a 3D-animated virtual agent delivering the dialogue. Through participants' evaluations of the task experience and final dialogues, we show that HealthDial provides a promising first step for counselors to ensure full coverage of their health education materials, while creating understandable and actionable virtual agent dialogue with patients.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15896v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background/Objectives: Efficient task allocation in hospital emergency departments (EDs) is critical for operational efficiency and patient care quality, yet the complexity of staff coordination poses significant challenges. This study proposes a simulation-based framework for modeling doctors and nurses as intelligent agents guided by computational trust mechanisms. The objective is to explore how trust-informed coordination can support decision making in ED management. Methods: The framework was implemented in Unity, a 3D graphics platform, where agents assess their competence before undertaking tasks and adaptively coordinate with colleagues. The simulation environment enables real-time observation of workflow dynamics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. We examined three scenarios - Baseline, Replacement, and Training - reflecting alternative staff management strategies. Results: Trust-informed task allocation balanced patient safety and efficiency by adapting to nurse performance levels. In the Baseline scenario, prioritizing safety reduced errors but increased patient delays compared to a FIFO policy. The Replacement scenario improved throughput and reduced delays, though at additional staffing cost. The training scenario forstered long-term skill development among low-performing nurses, despite short-term delays and risks. These results highlight the trade-off between immediate efficiency gains and sustainable capacity building in ED staffing. Conclusions: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of computational trust for evidence-based decision support in emergency medicine. By linking staff coordination with adaptive decision making, it provides hospital managers with a tool to evaluate alternative policies under controlled and repeatable conditions, while also laying a foundation for future AI-driven personalized decision support.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15895v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a multimodal system for personalized music generation that integrates physiological sensing, LLM-based reasoning, and controllable audio synthesis. A millimeter-wave radar sensor non-invasively captures heart rate and respiration rate. These physiological signals, combined with environmental state, are interpreted by a reasoning agent to infer symbolic musical descriptors, such as tempo, mood intensity, and traditional Chinese pentatonic modes, which are then expressed as structured prompts to guide a diffusion-based audio model in synthesizing expressive melodies. The system emphasizes cultural grounding through tonal embeddings and enables adaptive, embodied music interaction. To evaluate the system, we adopt a research-creation methodology combining case studies, expert feedback, and targeted control experiments. Results show that physiological variations can modulate musical features in meaningful ways, and tonal conditioning enhances alignment with intended modal characteristics. Expert users reported that the system affords intuitive, culturally resonant musical responses and highlighted its potential for therapeutic and interactive applications. This work demonstrates a novel bio-musical feedback loop linking radar-based sensing, prompt reasoning, and generative audio modeling.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15894v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we present a virtual immersive multi sensorial experience, Aromaverse. Aromaverse is an immersive 3D multiplayer environment augmented with olfactive experience where users can experience and customize perfumes. Being multi player, users can join the same space and enjoy a social buying experience. The olfactive experience embodied in the perfume allows users to experience their fragrances. This further enhances the user perception of perfumes in a virtual setting. Aromaverse also provides the ability to customize the perfumes by changing their top, mid, and base notes. The customized fragrances can be shared with other users, enabling a shared olfactive experience. To understand users' buying experience in such an environment, we conducted a set of experiments in which participants were requested to explore the space, experience the perfumes, customize them and buy them. They were asked to perform the same activities alone and in the presence of their friends. Various factors including the benefits and limitations of such an experience were captured by the questionnaires. Our results show that the presence of a companion enhances the shopping experience by improving the level of imagination of the product and helping in making purchase decisions. Our findings suggest that multi sensorial XR experiences offer great opportunities to retail firms to improve customer engagement and provide more realistic online experience of products that require other sensory modalities",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15891v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15890v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study presents a real-time, portable brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to support hand rehabilitation for stroke patients. The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15889v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The escalating demand for personalized AI chatbot interactions, capable of dynamically adapting to user emotional states and real-time requests, has highlighted critical limitations in current development paradigms. Existing methodologies, which rely on baseline programming, custom personalities, and manual response adjustments, often prove difficult to maintain and are susceptible to errors such as hallucinations, erratic outputs, and software bugs. This paper hypothesizes that a framework rooted in human psychological principles, specifically therapeutic modalities, can provide a more robust and sustainable solution than purely technical interventions. Drawing an analogy to the simulated neural networks of AI mirroring the human brain, we propose the application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) principles to regulate chatbot responses to diverse user inputs. This research investigates the impact of a DBT-based framework on AI chatbot performance, aiming to ascertain its efficacy in yielding more reliable, safe, and accurate responses, while mitigating the occurrence of hallucinations, erratic behaviors, and other systemic issues.",

      "content": "arXiv:2407.01656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.07237v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling approaches and several toolboxes with pre-trained models, the distinct strengths and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative modelling in neuroimaging. Through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data, we outline considerations for responsible implementation of pre-trained normative models, to support their broad and rigorous adoption in neuroimaging research.",

Here, we used diffusion imaging to construct the structural connectome of the entire human brain including 360 cortical, 233 subcortical, and 125 cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs). We found that the brain forms a modular and hierarchical network architecture, organized into modules of mixed cortical, subcortical and/or cerebellar regions, and whose cross-modular pathways are centralized through highly connected hub ROIs (a `rich-club'). This global rich-club is subcortically dominated and, surprisingly, composed of hub ROIs from all subcortical structures rather than one region like the thalamus, centralizing the communication pathways. This study improves our understanding of the human brain's organization.

      "content": "arXiv:2510.16327v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the human brain, the allowed patterns of activity are constrained by the correlations between brain regions. Yet it remains unclear which correlations -- and how many -- are needed to predict large-scale neural activity. Here, we present an information-theoretic framework to identify the most important correlations, which provide the most accurate predictions of neural states. Applying our framework to cortical activity in humans, we discover that the vast majority of variance in activity is explained by a small number of correlations. This means that the brain is highly compressible: only a sparse network of correlations is needed to predict large-scale activity. We find that this compressibility is strikingly consistent across different individuals and cognitive tasks, and that, counterintuitively, the most important correlations are not necessarily the strongest. Together, these results suggest that nearly all correlations are not needed to predict neural activity, and we provide the tools to uncover the key correlations that are.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15947v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.",

Our study primarily focuses on a proof-of-concept investigation based on simulated neural dynamics, for which the ground-truth causality is known through the underlying connectivity matrix. For transformer models trained to forecast neuronal population dynamics, we show that the cross attention module effectively captures the causal relationship among neurons, with an accuracy equal or superior to that for the most popular Granger causality analysis method. While we acknowledge that real-world neurobiology data will bring further challenges, including dynamic connectivity and unobserved variability, this research offers an encouraging preliminary glimpse into the utility of the transformer model for causal representation learning in neuroscience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17593v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In Hopfield-type associative memory models, memories are stored in the connectivity matrix and can be retrieved subsequently thanks to the collective dynamics of the network. In these models, the retrieval of a particular memory can be hampered by overlaps between the network state and other memories, termed spurious overlaps since these overlaps collectively introduce noise in the retrieval process. In classic models, spurious overlaps increase the variance of synaptic inputs but do not affect the mean. We show here that in models equipped with a learning rule inferred from neurobiological data, spurious overlaps collectively reduce the mean synaptic inputs to neurons, and that this mean reduction causes in turn an increase in storage capacity through a sparsening of network activity. Our paper demonstrates a link between a specific feature of experimentally inferred plasticity rules and network storage capacity.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17492v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of $N$ rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength $J_0$, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small $J_0$, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large $J_0$, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing $N$ and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.",

      "title": "A Minimal Quantitative Model of Perceptual Suppression and Breakthrough in Visual Rivalry",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17154v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When conflicting images are presented to either eye, binocular fusion is disrupted. Rather than experiencing a blend of both percepts, often only one eye's image is experienced, whilst the other is suppressed from awareness. Importantly, suppression is transient - the two rival images compete for dominance, with stochastic switches between mutually exclusive percepts occurring every few seconds with law-like regularity. From the perspective of dynamical systems theory, visual rivalry offers an experimentally tractable window into the dynamical mechanisms governing perceptual awareness. In a recently developed visual rivalry paradigm - tracking continuous flash suppression (tCFS) - it was shown that the transition between awareness and suppression is hysteretic, with a higher contrast threshold required for a stimulus to breakthrough suppression into awareness than to be suppressed from awareness. Here, we present an analytically-tractable model of visual rivalry that quantitatively explains the hysteretic transition between periods of awareness and suppression in tCFS. Grounded in the theory of neural dynamics, we derive closed-form expressions for the duration of perceptual dominance and suppression, and for the degree of hysteresis (i.e. the depth of perceptual suppression), as a function of model parameters. Finally, our model yields a series of novel behavioural predictions, the first of which - distributions of dominance and suppression durations during tCFS should be approximately equal - we empirically validate in human psychophysical data.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.16216v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: High-dimensional neural activity often reside in a low-dimensional subspace, referred to as neural manifolds. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a periodic spatial code that are organized near a toroidal manifold, independent of the spatial environment. Due to the periodic nature of its code, it is unclear how the brain utilizes the toroidal manifold to understand its state in a spatial environment. We introduce a novel framework that decodes spatial information from grid cell activity using topology. Our approach uses topological data analysis to extract toroidal coordinates from grid cell population activity and employs path-lifting to reconstruct trajectories in physical space. The reconstructed paths differ from the original by an affine transformation. We validated the method on both continuous attractor network simulations and experimental recordings of grid cells, demonstrating that local trajectories can be reliably reconstructed from a single grid cell module without external position information or training data. These results suggest that co-modular grid cells contain sufficient information for path integration and suggest a potential computational mechanism for spatial navigation.",
