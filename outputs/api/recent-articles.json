      "title": "PhaseICA: Complex-Valued Decomposition of Spatially Independent Brain Waves",
      "content": "Understanding complex dynamics from spatiotemporal signals requires robust tools capable of decoding reoccurring patterns. Traditional ICA methods often overlook the spatially non-stationarity nature of brain activity across both the frequency and spatial domains. We propose a novel data-driven approach, named PhaseICA, designed to extract reoccurring spatiotemporal patterns, referred to as brain waves. Unlike conventional ICA methods that focus solely on amplitude, PhaseICA incorporates phase information directly into the component estimation, preserving the nonstationary property that real-valued ICA methods typically discard. The method performs spatial independence optimization in the complex domain by minimizing a complex entropy bound over the eigenvectors of Hilbert-transformed signals. The proposed method captures spatial propagation across brain regions with interpretable and compact representations, offering a promising foundation for decoding brain dynamic systems and revealing the temporal relationship of regions.",

      "title": "Internal mechanosensory feedback modulates central pattern generation to coordinate ovulation in Drosophila",
      "content": "Successful reproduction requires precise coordination of muscle contractions during ovulation and has been well investigated in insects. However, the neural mechanisms of the central pattern generator (CPG) orchestrating this process remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we identify a novel pair of multidendritic mechanosensory neurons (mdn-LO) in the lateral oviducts that express the mechanosensitive channels TMC (transmembrane channel-like protein), PPK (pickpocket), and Piezo. We demonstrate that TMC is essential for ovulation coordination: tmc mutation or neuron-specific knockdown significantly increases egg-jamming at the junction between the lateral and the common oviduct, while ppk or Piezo single mutants reduce egg-laying without causing jamming. Calcium imaging reveals that mdn-LO neurons are rhythmically activated by oviduct contractions, and chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons triggers muscle contraction. Trans-Tango and GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners) analyses show that mdn-LO neurons form synapses with efferent insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)-expressing motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion. Activating either mdn-LO or ILP7 neurons induces egg-jamming, indicating their roles within a CPG network. This circuit, including the TMC-expressing mdn-LO neurons and a set of ILP7 neurons, organizes an innate behavior by coupling strategic sensory information and a CPG to ensure bilateral coordination of oviduct contractions to prevent egg jamming during oviposition.",

      "title": "Effects of the Neutral CB1 Receptor Antagonist AM6527 on Spontaneous, Consummatory, and Motivated Behavior in Mice",
      "content": "Rationale. The cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating motivational and feeding behaviors. Neutral CB1R antagonists represent a promising therapeutic class with potentially fewer adverse effects than inverse agonists, yet their behavioral effects remain incompletely characterized. Objectives. We investigated the behavioral profile of AM6527, orally bioavailable neutral CB1R antagonist, across naturalistic and operant paradigms in male mice. To evaluate dopaminergic involvement in AM6527s effects, we employed several pharmacological interventions. Results. Using machine learning-based Motion-Sequencing (MoSeq), which parses spontaneous behavior into sub-second syllables, we found that AM6527 did not affect overall speed in an open field, however, it increased the self-directed behaviors and reduced specific locomotor syllables at the highest dose tested. In a naturalistic reward consumption paradigm, AM6527 produced a dose-dependent reduction in milk intake. Operant conditioning paradigms revealed robust suppression of motivated responding on fixed ratio-3 and progressive ratio (PR) schedules for palatable milk reward, with the greatest impact on high-baseline performers under PR conditions. To understand the dopaminergic involvement, we co-administered dopaminergic drugs (targeting D1R, D2R, or dopamine transporter) which resulted in partial rescue of operant responding, indicating dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic contributions to AM6527s observed behavioral effects. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that neutral CB1R antagonism suppresses consummatory and motivated behaviors via dopamine-dependent and -independent mechanisms. By leveraging sub-second behavioral analysis with MoSeq, we further reveal distinct changes in spontaneous behavior, underscoring the relevance of CB-based treatments for maladaptive appetitive and motivational states in both psychiatric and metabolic disorder.",

      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

      "title": "Personalized beta band HD-tACS over the left SMA improves speech and limb movement by modulating prefrontal delta oscillations in neurotypical young adults",
      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

      "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

      "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",
