      "title": "Gene Therapy for Efficient Suppression of T-Type Channels in Treating Diabetic Neuropathy",
      "content": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a chronic and often incurable syndrome, is one of the most common and unpleasant complications of diabetes. Effective clinical interventions for PDN are very limited and already developed approaches are characterized by lack of molecular or cellular target specificity and a short duration of therapeutic effects. Numerous investigations causally link upregulation of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels in peripheral nociceptive neurons to painful symptoms of PDN. Here we suggest an approach to alleviate these symptoms based on implementation of virus-mediated cell-specific delivery of vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Processed by Dicer into specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), they would suppress the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels. In order to experimentally validate this approach, we have initially confirmed the ability of designed Dicer-substrate small interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs) to suppress expression of T-type channels in neurons of primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Target sequences of the effectively interfering DsiRNA were then used to design shRNAs and the coding sequences of shRNAs were cloned into the vector pAAV under U6 promotor. This plasmid was also proved to be effective in interference with expression of the T-type channels in the rat cultured DRG neurons. The expression cassette of this plasmid will be packed into AAV6 particles with tropism to unmyelinated fibers to suppress T-type channel expression in nociceptive DRG neurons and to alleviate painful symptoms of PDN.",

      "title": "Disruption of Striatal Intrinsic Ignition in Huntington's Disease: an In-Silico Perturbational Approach to Emulate Disease Progression and Recovery",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single gene that severely affects motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is ultimately fatal. While disruptions in the structural integrity of the striatum are well documented, less is known about how the underlying functional impairments relate to the disease. We developed a large-scale modeling framework based on intrinsic ignition to uncover functional anomalies during HD progression. We first measured how much a spontaneous event in one brain region influences the rest of the brain, then systematically perturbed the activity of the striatum to predict the empirical changes in functional connectivity (FC) by re-optimizing the model parameters and conducting in-silico experiments. Results showed that disruption of the activity dynamics in the caudate, and to some extent the putamen, are the key factors that explain a substantial amount of the variance in FC alterations during HD progression. We then assessed the ability to recover whole-brain functional activity by driving the caudate and putamen activity towards a healthy-like regime and found that, by tuning the local bifurcation parameter of caudate and putamen, it is possible to recover whole-brain healthy functional activity, albeit moderately. Surprisingly, although the functional disruptions in the caudate better explained the alterations in FC, the recovery of the dynamics was more effective in the putamen. Overall, our results suggest that the disruptions of the dynamics in the striatum can explain the gross functional connectivity changes in HD. Our study demonstrates that computational modeling is an important tool to reveal the underlying patterns behind the observed data and provides an opportunity to test interventional mechanisms in silico.",

      "title": "ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations promote fragility of genes governing excitatory neurotransmission via topoisomerase II\u03b2 impairment",
      "content": "Abnormal TAR DNA/RNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization, aggregation, and pathogenic mutations. Altered excitatory neuronal transmission is an early functional defect in these diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neuronal activity can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting a potential link between altered excitability and genomic instability. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TDP-43 is involved in neuronal activity-induced DSBs. Moreover, we show that ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations (A90V and A315T) disrupt this mechanism, leading to the accumulation of DSBs and altered neuronal activity compared to wild-type TDP-43 protein. Using the BLISS technique, we mapped genome-wide DSBs in primary mouse neurons expressing wild-type or mutant (A90V, A315T) TDP-43 and found enrichment of DSBs within genes regulating excitatory transmission. Mechanistically, the TDP-43 A90V mutation impairs topoisomerase II{beta} function, resulting in enzyme trapping and/or DNA supercoiling that predisposes DNA to breaks. Notably, this impairment is partially rescued by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) overexpression. These findings uncover a novel mechanism linking aberrant neuronal activity and DNA damage, bridging two key pathological hallmarks of ALS/FTD associated with TDP-43 dysfunction. It also paves the way for developing novel therapeutic approaches that rely on targeted DSB repair and/or modulating topoisomerase II{beta}-DNA complexes.",

      "title": "Effective connectivity reveals a shift to left-hemisphere dominance for spatial attention with diminishing arousal",
      "content": "In healthy righthanders, spatial attention typically becomes biased to the right side when alertness wanes. The underlying neural mechanisms of healthy spatial attention and these drowsiness-related spatial biases remain contested. Competing theories propose that attention is governed either by the interaction of two bilateral networks (dual-network model) or by a dominant right hemisphere (right hemisphere dominance model). To adjudicate between these models, we investigated how effective connectivity within the auditory cortical hierarchy is modulated by drowsiness. We recorded high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) in 32 healthy participants performing a lateralised auditory localisation task in both awake and drowsy states. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis revealed that arousal states become decodable approximately 150 ms post-stimulus. We used Parametric Empirical Bayes and Dynamic Causal Modelling to map arousal-dependent changes in effective connectivity between left-sided and right-sided auditory stimuli. Consistent with the right hemisphere dominance model of spatial attention, right-sided stimuli elicited stronger bidirectional information flow between bilateral inferior frontal gyri during wakefulness. However, we observed a significant reduction in right-hemispheric frontoparietal connectivity alongside a strengthening of a left-hemispheric pathway from the inferior parietal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus during drowsiness. This finding supports the dual-network theory and conflicts with the right hemisphere theory's prediction of a bilateral decrease in activity during drowsiness. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how diminishing arousal shifts cortical processing from a bilaterally integrated network to a left-lateralised state. Our results therefore support the dual-network model of spatial attention while retaining elements of the right hemisphere model.",

      "title": "Attentional focus and emotion modulate voice recognition deficits in cerebellar stroke patients",
      "content": "The cerebellum, long regarded as a motor structure, is increasingly recognized for its role in higher-order cognitive and socio-emotional functions. Its contribution to vocal emotion decoding, however, remains insufficiently understood. While prior work has linked the cerebellum to attentional control and predictive coding, direct evidence for its role in modulating prosody recognition under explicit versus implicit attentional demands is lacking. This study investigated how cerebellar stroke, controlled for time since stroke in months, and with an equal number of left- and right-lateralized lesions, alters vocal emotion processing depending on attentional focus. We aimed to disentangle sensory encoding and integration from decisional contributions of the cerebellum by combining behavioral analyses, drift diffusion modeling (DDM), and functional MRI in cerebellar stroke. Fifteen patients with chronic, isolated cerebellar stroke and fifteen matched controls performed two tasks on vocal stimuli expressing anger, happiness, or neutrality. In the explicit task, participants categorized the expressed emotion; in the implicit task, they categorized speaker gender while ignoring emotional tone. Behavioral performance was analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression and DDM (angle model). Functional MRI analyses included conventional contrasts as well as model-based regressors derived from behavioral and computational parameters. Patients showed lower accuracy than controls, with deficits particularly pronounced in the explicit task. Performance also varied by emotion: gender recognition for angry voices (implicit processing) was relatively preserved, whereas happy and neutral voices were more vulnerable. Contrary to predictions, DDM parameters did not differ between groups. Instead, task effects dominated: implicit processing yielded higher drift rates, larger boundary separation, faster non-decision times, and stronger attentional focus compared to explicit recognition, suggesting that explicit evaluation imposes additional cognitive costs. At the neural level, patients recruited extended networks during explicit processing, including orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior insula, and cerebellar lobule IX, alongside cerebello-cortical tracts. Implicit processing was associated with more restricted activations, particularly in frontal opercular and cerebellar regions (lobule IX). Model-based analyses further revealed that successful categorization in patients relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and pre-supplementary motor area, although these effects were not significant when controlling for time since stroke. Our findings demonstrate that the cerebellum does not primarily shape decision dynamics but optimizes sensory representations of prosodic cues for downstream evaluation. When predictive tuning is compromised, patients maintain intact decision processes yet rely on compensatory cortical recruitment, particularly during explicit tasks. This pattern supports predictive coding accounts of cerebellar function in socio-emotional communication and highlights the need to consider subtle socio-affective deficits in cerebellar patients.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/embar\">https://github.com/carderne/embar</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href=\"https://embar.rdrn.me/\">https://embar.rdrn.me/</a></p> <p>I've mostly worked in TypeScript for the last year or two, and I felt unproductive coming back to Python. SQLAlchemy is extremely powerful, but I've never been able to write a query without checking the docs. There are other newcomers (I listed some <a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/embar?tab=readme-ov-file#other-orms-to-consider\">here</a>) but none of them are very type-safe.</p> <h1>What my project does</h1> <p>This is a Python ORM I've been slowly working on over the last couple of weeks.</p> <h1>Target audience</h1> <p>This might be interesting to you if:</p> <ul> <li>Type-safety is important to you</li> <li>You like an ORM (or query builder) that maps closely to SQL</li> <li>You want async support</li> <li>You <em>don't</em> like &quot;Active Record&quot; objects. Embar returns plain dumb objects. Want to update them? Construct another query and run it.</li> <li>You like <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview\">Drizzle</a> (this will never be as type-safe as Drizzle, as Python's type system simply isn't as powerful)</li> </ul> <p>Currently it supports sqlite3, as well as Postgres (using psycopg3, both sync and async supported). It would be quite easy to support other databases or clients.</p> <p>It uses Pydantic for validation (though it could be made pluggable) and is built with the FastAPI ecosystem/vibe/use-case in mind.</p> <h1>Why am I posting this</h1> <p>I'm looking for feedback on whether the hivemind thinks this is worth pursuing! It's very early days, and there are many missing features, but for 95% of CRUD I already find this much easier to use than SQLAlchemy. Feedback from &quot;friends and family&quot; has been encouraging, but hard to know whether this is a valuable effort!</p> <p>I'm also looking for advice on a few big interface decisions. Specifically:</p> <ol> <li>Right now, <code>update</code> queries require additional <code>TypedDict</code> models, so each table basically has to be defined twice (once for the schema, again for typed updates). The only (?) obvious way around this is to have a codegen CLI that creates the <code>TypedDict</code> models from the Table definitions.</li> <li>Drizzle also has a &quot;query&quot; interface, which makes common CRUD queries very simple. Like Prisma's interface, if that's familiar. Eg <code>result = db.users.findMany(where=Eq(user.id, &quot;1&quot;))</code>. This would also require codegen. Basically... how resistant should I be to adding codegen?!?</li> <li>Is it worth adding a migration diffing engine (lots of work, hard to get exactly right) or should I just push people towards something like sqldef/sqitch?</li> </ol> <p>Have a look, it already works very well, is fully documented and thoroughly tested.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ol> <li>Type-safe. I looked at SQLAlchemy, PonyORM, PugSQL, TortoiseORM, Piccolo, ormar. All of them frequently allow <code>Any</code> to be passed. Many have cases where they return dicts instead of typed objects.</li> <li>Simple. Very subjective. But if you know SQL, you should be able to cobble together an Embar query without looking at the docs (and maybe some help from your LSP).</li> <li>Performant. N+1 is not possible: Embar creates a single SQL query for each query you write. And you can always look at it with the <code>.sql()</code> method.</li> </ol> <h1>Sample usage</h1> <p>There are fully worked examples one GitHub and in the docs. Here are one or two:</p> <p>Set up models:</p> <pre><code># schema.py from embar.column.common import Integer, Text from embar.config import EmbarConfig from embar.table import Table class User(Table): id: Integer = Integer(primary=True) class Message(Table): user_id: Integer = Integer().fk(lambda: User.id) content: Text = Text() </code></pre> <p>Create db client:</p> <pre><code>import sqlite3 from embar.db.sqlite import SqliteDb conn = sqlite3.connect(&quot;:memory:&quot;) db = SqliteDb(conn) db.migrate([User, Message]).run() </code></pre> <p>Insert some data:</p> <pre><code>user = User(id=1) message = Message(user_id=user.id, content=&quot;Hello!&quot;) db.insert(User).values(user).run() db.insert(Message).values(message).run() </code></pre> <p>Query your data:</p> <pre><code>from typing import Annotated from pydantic import BaseModel from embar.query.where import Eq, Like, Or class UserSel(BaseModel): id: Annotated[int, User.id] messages: Annotated[list[str], Message.content.many()] users = ( db.select(UserSel) .fromm(User) .left_join(Message, Eq(User.id, Message.user_id)) .where(Or( Eq(User.id, 1), Like(User.email, &quot;foo%&quot;) )) .group_by(User.id) .run() ) # [ UserSel(id=1, messages=['Hello!']) ] </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chris-indeed\"> /u/chris-indeed </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj6im3/embar_an_orm_for_python_strongly_typed_sqlesque/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj6im3/embar_an_orm_for_python_strongly_typed_sqlesque/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Morphometric Latent Factors in Autism and Their Association with Receptor Profiles and Behavior",
      "content": "The profound heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a major barrier to developing targeted therapies. While dimensional subtyping using functional connectivity (FC) has advanced the field, the intrinsic instability of FC limits its power to identify stable trait-like biomarkers. This study provides a direct comparison of latent factors derived from both FC and a stable morphometric measure, Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND), within the same ASD cohort. We hypothesized that stable structural factors would provide a more behaviorally relevant and biologically grounded account of ASD heterogeneity. Our findings reveal an important dissociation between functional and morphometric features. Latent factors derived from morphometric similarity (MIND) significantly correlated with core ASD behavioral traits (SCQ, SRS), while functional factors showed no association. This dissociation was also found at the neural level. Specifically, we observed weaker structure-function correspondence in the ASD group compared to the healthy control group (HC). Moreover, the stable structural factors were linked to trait-like neurodevelopmental mechanisms: the association with the CB1 receptor (important for synaptic pruning) observed in the HC was notably missing in the ASD group. Conversely, the functional factors were associated with a state-like arousal system (the norepinephrine transporter, NET). Collectively, our results demonstrate that stable morphometric-based factors, rather than time-varying functional ones, are predictive of behavioral traits in ASD. This work validates MIND as a robust approach and suggests that the link between structural organization and its neurodevelopmental (CB1) underpinnings is a more powerful and stable target for developing biomarkers in autism.",

      "title": "Traumatic Conditioning Induces a Combination of Anesthesia Resistant Memory and Protein Synthesis Dependent Long-Term Memory in Adult Drosophila",
      "content": "Stressful experiences elicit long-lasting memory trace that often persists for life-time. Though storage of experience dependent memory is key to survival, post-traumatic memories are detrimental to the physical and emotional wellbeing. The generation of any form of long-term memory culminates from synaptic plasticity and potentiation through persistent change in protein synthesis. Drosophila has been a robust model for the study of memory mechanisms; olfactory memory paradigms have been enormously successful in elucidating neuroanatomical, molecular, physiological and signalling pathways underlying the process. Long-term memory (LTM) has been induced by protein synthesis dependent mechanisms followed by a post-learning consolidation process whereas a medium-term anaesthesia resistant memory (ARM) is mediated by the Radish protein in flies. Here we present a novel and simple memory paradigm in adult flies for inducing sustained stress-induced memory paradigm, where a single attractive odorant is associated with an aversive stimulus- copper sulfate, which provides bitter taste as well as sustained malaise due to toxicity. We find that the elicited memory is a combination of ARM and LTM which is dependent on the number of training cycles. The eight-cycle training paradigm leads to robust, CREB and protein synthesis dependent memory persisting for about 7 days. The mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells neurons as well as the dopaminergic input neurons (PPL1 subset) are involved in the formation of memory mediated by enhanced calcium as well as synaptic elaboration in the {gamma} subset of the MB neurons.",

      "content": "Epilepsy often becomes treatment-resistant, partly due to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Enhancing inhibitory neuron activity via gene therapy may restore excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We developed a compact 410-bp glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter (cmGAD67) that enables strong, selective transgene expression in inhibitory neurons while preserving AAV packaging capacity. When delivered systemically, AAV vectors carrying cmGAD67 preferentially targeted parvalbumin interneurons and supported effective circuit manipulation. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) under cmGAD67 (AAV-GAD65) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) epilepsy models. Systemic AAV-GAD65 suppressed abnormal delta oscillations, reduced seizure-like events, normalized anxiety-like behavior, and improved survival in a severe PTZ paradigm. Biochemical analyses confirmed increased cortical and hippocampal GABA levels, linking behavioral and electrophysiological improvements to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis. Prior clinical evidence indicates that AAV-GAD65 delivery to the subthalamic nucleus is safe and effective in Parkinson's disease. Building on this foundation, our findings establish the cmGAD67 promoter as a powerful platform for inhibitory neuron-targeted AAV gene therapy and highlight AAV-cmGAD67-GAD65 as a promising approach for treatment-resistant epilepsy and other disorders involving disrupted E/I balance.",

      "title": "Normative modeling of brain morphology reveals neuroanatomical heterogeneity and biological subtypes in major depressive disorder",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by high neurobiological heterogeneity, which hinders precise diagnosis and treatment. Traditional group-level neuroimaging analyses fail to capture individual differences, while normative modeling offer a promising approach to quantify individual deviations from healthy brain structure patterns, facilitating the identification of biological subtypes and offering a data-driven framework to dissect this heterogeneity. METHODS: Using 1,190 healthy controls (age 22-37), we constructed normative developmental trajectories of gray matter volume (GMV) across 246 Brainnetomedefined regions using Bayesian linear regression. Deviation maps were derived for 398 MDD patients. k-means clustering was employed to identify GMV-based biotypes. Then, the clinical characteristics and anatomical differences among these subtypes were explored, along with the post-treatment clinical features and treatment responses of participants who completed the 8-week antidepressant treatment within each subtype. RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited widespread yet individually variable GMV deviations. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes: Subtype 1 displayed predominantly negative deviations in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, whereas Subtype 2 showed widespread positive deviations in temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Subtype 1 had higher extraversion and symptom-linked deviation patterns; in Subtype 2, deviation burden correlated with generalized anxiety. Longitudinally, Subtype 1's GMV deviation changes predicted symptom improvement, while Subtype 2's deviations correlated with baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS: Normative modeling of GMV reveals marked neuroanatomical heterogeneity in MDD and identifies subtypes with distinct clinical and treatment-related characteristics, laying a foundation for precision psychiatry and individualized interventions.",
