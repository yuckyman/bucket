      "title": "Neurochemically-evoked activity in slice preparations of the octopus arm nerve cord",
      "content": "Octopus arms contain circuits that support local sensorimotor integration and autonomy, responsible for fast and flexible behaviors, but their population dynamics remain unknown. The axial nerve cord (ANC) is a series of sucker-associated ganglia whose cortex layer houses multiple classes of intermingled neurons. Here we use calcium imaging in ex vivo slices from arms of Octopus bocki, to visualize how these networks respond to controlled application of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Glutamate and dopamine are dominant excitatory drivers that activate most neurons in the ANC cortex, with a substantial overlapping populations and smaller transmitter-specific subsets. Glutamate continues to excite additional neurons at higher concentration, whereas dopamine responses saturate. Serotonin alone evokes mixed responses but, when applied first, consistently reduces glutamate- and dopamine-driven activation, revealing a state-dependent modulatory role. GABA and octopamine yield weak heterologous effects, and high-dose acetylcholine sharply suppresses global ANC neuronal activity while inducing muscular contraction, consistent with inhibitory cholinergic receptors in arm ganglia. Across conditions, responsive neurons show no evidence of spatial structure, with no clear anatomical segregation by transmitter response profiles. These results provide the first link between neurochemical architecture and real-time firing dynamics in a semi-autonomous circuit.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "title": "Alterations in gut microbiota and plasma metabolites: a multi-omics study of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and plasma metabolites may be associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The interplay between gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in influencing the progression of cognitive impairment in PD is yet to be fully understood and requires further exploration. Our objective was to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in PD cognitive impairment.MethodsWe initially recruited 100 individuals with PD and 50 healthy controls (HCs). After excluding participants based on education level and cognitive screening criteria, the final cohort comprised 38 PD patients and 40 HCs. We examined fecal and plasma specimens from these participants. Cognitive function was assessed via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Gut microbiota was analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing, and plasma metabolites were evaluated via Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Using Spearman correlation to analyze the association between gut microbiota and plasma metabolites.ResultsPD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) exhibited distinct microbial and metabolic profiles compared to PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). Consistent with both the Gut Microbiota Health Index (GMHI) and Gut Microbiota Health Index (MDI), PD-MCI patients exhibited significant gut microbial dysbiosis. Multi-algorithm differential abundance analysis identified g__Eggerthella as a core depleted genus in PD-MCI, consistently validated across both LEfSe and MaAsLin2 analyses. Additional microbial alterations included depletion of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)-producing genera (g__Blautia, g__Lachnoclostridium, g__Erysipelatoclostridium, g__norank_f__norank_o__Oscillospirales, g__Megasphaera, and g__Lactococcus) and enrichment of g__Senegalimassilia in PD-MCI. Metabolite analysis revealed that phenylalanine metabolism (including phenylacetylglutamine, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, and phenylacetylglycine) and PPAR signaling pathways (including 8-hydroxy-5Z,9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) were downregulated in the PD-MCI group, while choline metabolism in cancer (including PC(18:1(11Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) and LysoPC(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/0:0)) was upregulated. Notably, phenylacetylglutamine demonstrated robust diagnostic potential (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.8222), emerging as a promising biomarker for PD-MCI. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between key microbial taxa (particularly g__Eggerthella and SCFA-producing genera) and metabolites (phenylacetylglutamine, and uridine 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate), suggesting their interactive role in PD cognitive impairment through gut-brain axis mechanisms.ConclusionOur multi-omics study revealed distinct gut microbiota and metabolite alterations in PD patients with cognitive impairment, highlighting gut-brain axis dysfunction. Key microbial and metabolic markers demonstrated diagnostic potential, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of PD-related cognitive decline and potential targets for future therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Effectiveness and safety of magnetic resonance\u2013guided unilateral focused ultrasound subthalamotomy for Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with asymmetric, medication-refractory Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) often continue to experience disabling motor symptoms despite optimized pharmacological management. Magnetic resonance\u2013guided focused ultrasound subthalamotomy (FUS-STN) has recently emerged as a promising, non-invasive alternative for improving motor function. However, its overall clinical efficacy and long-term safety remain the subject of active investigation.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to 30 November 2024. Prospective studies that assessed unilateral FUS-STN in patients with PD were included. Data were pooled using RevMan 5.3 for mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsFour prospective studies (n\u202f=\u202f69) were included. Unilateral FUS-STN significantly reduced the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III scores for the treated hemibody in both the off-medication [MD\u202f=\u202f\u221211.01, 95% CI (\u221212.23, \u22129.80), p\u202f<\u202f0.001] and on-medication states [MD\u202f=\u202f\u22126.51, 95% CI (\u22127.57, \u22125.42), p\u202f<\u202f0.001]. The MDS-UPDRS II (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22123.05, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and 39-item Parkinson\u2019s disease questionnaire summary index (PDQ-39SI) scores (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22126.99, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) also improved. Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was reduced in the short term (MD\u202f=\u202f\u2212149.5\u202fmg, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), although it was attenuated at 12\u202fmonths (p\u202f=\u202f0.09). No significant improvement was observed in MDS-UPDRS IV scores (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22123.29, p\u202f=\u202f0.64). In all included studies, adverse events (AEs) were frequent during and after the procedure, such as postoperative gait and speech disturbance, facial asymmetry, and dyskinesia. However, the majority of AEs were resolved during the 6\u201312\u202fmonth follow-up period.ConclusionUnilateral FUS-STN may offer symptomatic benefits and a general safety profile in selected patients with asymmetric PD. Future investigations should emphasize large-scale, longitudinal, multicenter, and symptom-specific randomized controlled trials to assess the long-term benefits and risks of unilateral FUS-STN in PD patients.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251002754, identifier PROSPERO (CRD420251002754).",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "Phase-specific multimodal biomarkers enable explainable assessment of upper limb dysfunction in chronic stroke",
      "content": "BackgroundObjective and precise assessment of upper limb dysfunction post-stroke is critical for guiding rehabilitation. While promising, current methods using wearable sensors and machine learning (ML) often lack interpretability and neglect underlying, phase-specific kinetic deficits (e.g., muscle forces and joint torques) within functional tasks. This study aimed to develop and validate an explainable assessment framework that leverages musculoskeletal kinetic modeling to extract phase-specific, multimodal (kinematic and kinetic) biomarkers to assess upper limb dysfunction in chronic stroke.MethodsSixty-five adults with chronic stroke and 20 healthy controls performed a standardized hand-to-mouth (HTM) task. Stroke participants were allocated to a model-development cohort (n\u202f=\u202f47) and an independent test cohort (n\u202f=\u202f18). Using IMU and sEMG data, we employed musculoskeletal modeling to extract phase-specific kinematic (e.g., inter-joint coordination, trunk displacement) and kinetic (e.g., mechanical work, smoothness, co-contraction index) biomarkers from four task phases. A Lasso regression model was trained to predict FMA-UL scores, validated via 5-fold cross-validation and the independent test cohort. Explainable AI (SHAP) was used to identify key predictive features.ResultsCompared with controls, patients showed phase-specific alterations including greater trunk displacement and reduced inter-joint coordination and mechanical work (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The Lasso model achieved strong performance in internal validation (R2\u202f=\u202f0.932; MAE\u202f=\u202f0.799) and generalized well to the independent test cohort (R2\u202f=\u202f0.881; MAE\u202f=\u202f0.954). SHAP identified trunk displacement in phase 2 (TD_2), elbow\u2013shoulder coordination in phase 3 (IC_elb_elv_3), and trunk displacement in phase 3 (TD_3) as dominant predictors; larger trunk displacement contributed negatively to predicted FMA-UL scores.ConclusionIntegrating phase-specific multimodal biomarkers with explainable ML yields an interpretable upper-limb dysfunction. By highlighting phase-specific kinetic and kinematic targets (e.g., trunk compensation and inter-joint coordination), the framework supports individualized, precision rehabilitation.",

      "content": "Hemispheric brain asymmetries emerge in early life but continue to change over time. However, there is no consensus on whether asymmetries become weaker or stronger with age or which brain regions are most affected. Here, we set out to further explore age-related changes in brain asymmetry, with a particular focus on voxel-wise gray matter asymmetry. For this purpose, we selected a sample of 2,322 participants (1,150 women/1,172 men), aged between 47 and 80\u202fyears (mean 62.3\u202fyears), from the UK Biobank. Each participant was scanned twice; with an interval between baseline and follow-up scans ranging between 1 and 7\u202fyears (mean 2.4\u202fyears). Significant changes in asymmetry were observed, particularly in the temporal and occipital lobe, as well as the cerebellum. Overall, decreases in asymmetry were more prominent than increases, but with hemisphere-specific effects (i.e., leftward asymmetries decreased more than increased, while rightward asymmetries increased more than decreased). Changes in asymmetry were not significantly associated with chronological age or biological sex, suggesting that these changes neither accelerate nor decelerate with increasing age, and do not differ between the sexes. Follow-up research \u2013 potentially incorporating additional morphometric measures, different stages of life, and/or clinical populations \u2013 is necessary, not only to replicate the current findings but also to investigate changes over longer timeframes.",

      "title": "GABAergic neurons are a key cell type in a Drosophila model of PARK14/PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration",
      "content": "The causes of sporadic Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) are still unclear, despite its prevalence. By contrast, inherited parkinsonian disorders have a clear genetic basis and have been studied intensively in laboratory organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. Because inherited parkinsonian disorders clinically resemble sporadic PD, it has been suggested that they may share an underlying etiology. Loss of function mutations in the gene PLA2G6 give rise to inherited neurodegenerative diseases including autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (PARK14). Using RNAi to deplete the Drosophila PLA2G6 homolog iPLA2-VIA, we asked whether subsets of neurons, identified by their neurotransmitter usage, were more susceptible to loss of this gene. To model movement disorders connected with PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, we used the well-established climbing assay. Our results demonstrated that loss of iPLA2-VIA in GABAergic neurons alone strongly affected locomotor ability in aged flies, similar to pan-neuronal knockdown. Depletion of iPLA2-VIA in both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons weakly affected locomotor ability as well. Depletion in other neuronal subsets did not disrupt locomotion. Furthermore, reintroducing wild-type iPLA2-VIA into only the dopaminergic neurons of fly knockouts improved climbing performance slightly, while reintroduction into GABAergic neurons rescued climbing performance strikingly, as well as lifespan. Although much research on this gene has focused on the dopaminergic neurons, whose degeneration leads to clinical parkinsonism, our results highlight the importance of GABAergic neurons to PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration. Because sporadic PD is not thought to impact most GABAergic neurons directly, our data support the idea that sporadic PD and PARK14 have distinct etiologies despite overlapping clinical presentations.",

      "title": "From environment to brain: the role of microplastics in neurobehavioral disorders",
      "content": "In recent years, the pervasive presence of microplastics has attracted significant attention from the scientific community, particularly concerning their potential implications for human health. Current literature suggests that microplastics may adversely affect the nervous system, with emerging evidence linking them to neurobehavioral disorders. However, many questions remain regarding the pathways of their environmental exposure, the specific effects on neurobehavior, and the underlying mechanisms of their impact. This review aims to explore the routes through which humans are exposed to microplastics, monitor behavioral changes associated with microplastic exposure, and examine how these particles infiltrate the body and traverse the blood-brain barrier. Several perspectives will be considered in assessing the potential mechanisms by which microplastics may influence neurobehavioral disorders, including oxidative stress, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuroplasticity. The article concludes by summarizing the effects of microplastics on neurobehavioral disorders, such as neurodegeneration and mood disorders, while analyzing the latest research findings. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the neurotoxic effects of microplastics and their potential biological mechanisms, as well as to provide new insights and recommendations for future research in this domain.",

      "title": "Comparative effectiveness of rhythmic grip training of various intensities on cognitive function in young adults: a fNIRS study",
      "content": "IntroductionResistance training has a significant influence on cognitive function. Rhythmic handgrip (RHG) exercise, a practical form of small-muscle group training, may improve cognitive performance. However, the effects of resistance training at various intensities on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation and cognitive outcomes remain unclear.MethodsThis study recruited 24 healthy male participants (mean age: 22.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.31\u202fyears). Participants completed experiments at three intensity levels [30%, 50%, and 70% Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC)] in a randomized order, with one-week intervals between sessions. During dynamic handgrip resistance training, participants performed rhythmic fist contractions at the target intensity, maintaining a frequency of 1 Hz for 30 s, followed by 30 s of rest. Each training set consisted of four contraction-rest cycles, and participants completed three sets in total, separated by 3-min rest periods. Cognitive task testing including the Stroop task, 2-Back task, and More-Odd Shifting task, was administered before and after each intervention. Cognitive performance was evaluated using reaction time and accuracy measures. Simultaneously, functional near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to measure changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in the prefrontal cortex during task execution.ResultsThe moderate-intensity (50% MVC) rhythmic handgrip task produced the greatest improvements in cognitive performance. Behaviorally, participants showed faster reaction times and higher accuracy than in low- (30% MVC) or high-intensity (70% MVC) conditions. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy results showed that moderate-intensity rhythmic handgrip enhanced the efficiency of prefrontal modulation, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The 50% MVC condition reduced oxygenated hemoglobin levels, indicating optimized neural efficiency and more effective cortical resource allocation during task performance.ConclusionModerate-intensity (50% MVC) RHG training significantly enhances executive function, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, while demonstrating more efficient neural activity. As a practical form of small-muscle-group training, moderate-intensity RHG resistance offers a promising early-intervention strategy for delaying cognitive decline and reducing dementia risk.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2400083689.",
