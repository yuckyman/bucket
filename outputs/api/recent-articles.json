      "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
      "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

      "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",
