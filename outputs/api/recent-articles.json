      "content": "Learning to read triggers a cascade of changes in children's minds and brains, changes that lead to the formation of the \"reading brain\". Importantly, the developmental trajectory of these changes differs across languages. The development of phonological literacy skills comes first for learners of alphabetic languages such as English. In Chinese, however, phonological literacy skills take longer to finetune due to the character's phonological opacity. Bilingualism theories, however, suggest that...",

      "content": "Adversarial training is an effective defense method for deep models against adversarial attacks. However, current adversarial training methods require retraining the entire neural network, which consumes a significant amount of computational resources, thereby affecting the timeliness of deep models and further hindering the rapid learning process of new knowledge. In response to the above problems, this article proposes an incremental adversarial training method (IncAT) and applies it to the...",

Combining gut microbiota and brain function biomarkers may benefit disease diagnosis and predict treatment outcome. Nonetheless, these findings should be carefully interpreted considering the limitations of a modest sample size and the absence of detailed mechanistic explorations. Trial registration NCT05480150.

Based on our analysis, we argue that current BMR does not pose unique ethical challenges compared with other forms of mind reading, and therefore does not yet justify the establishment of a distinct right to mental privacy.",

TMS has demonstrated significant clinical potential in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. However, conventional TMS targeting methods that rely on anatomical landmarks do not adequately account for individual differences in brain...",

      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has emerged as a pivotal branch in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and elevated information transfer rate (ITR). However, substantial inter-subject variability in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals poses a significant challenge to current SSVEP frequency recognition. In particular, it is difficult to achieve high cross-subject classification accuracy in calibration-free scenarios, and the...",
