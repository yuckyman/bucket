      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "Modeling and validation in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with frailty",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The risk of frailty is significantly higher in patients with PD than in age-matched individuals without PD. This study aimed to develop a machine learning\u2013based predictive model for frailty in PD.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of early- and middle-stage PD patients recruited from June 2024 to June 2025 at Shenzhen People\u2019s Hospital. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria (five components: gait speed, grip strength, physical activity, fatigue, and weight loss). A total of 42 demographic and clinical variables, including disease history, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores, were collected and compared between PD patients with and without frailty. Spearman correlation and LASSO regression were used to identify independent risk factors. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the ROC curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration plots, and forest plots.ResultsA total of 205 PD patients were enrolled (133 non-frail, 72 frail; mean age non-frail 62.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.69\u202fyears, frail 68.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.44\u202fyears). Significant group differences were found in sex (p\u202f=\u202f0.013), age (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), disease severity (MDS-UPDRS, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; modified Hoehn-Yahr stage (H&amp;Y stage), p\u202f<\u202f0.001), alcohol consumption (p\u202f=\u202f0.010), MoCA (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), HAMD (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Eight features were identified as independent predictors of frailty: sex, age, alcohol use, Modified H&amp;Y stage, UPDRS-IV score, HAMA score, executive function, and naming. Among all tested algorithms, logistic regression achieved the best predictive performance (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.83 in the test set), outperforming other machine learning models.ConclusionFrailty in PD was associated with female sex, older age, alcohol use, and more advanced disease severity. Patients with PD and frailty exhibited higher MDS-UPDRS scores, more severe cognitive impairment, and greater levels of depression and anxiety. Integrating clinical data with machine learning, especially logistic regression, provides a reliable and scalable tool for early identification and risk stratification of frailty in PD.",

      "title": "Heart rate variability and its modulation by nutrients: a narrative review on implications for cardiovascular aging",
      "content": "Altered intercellular communication is a hallmark of aging, influencing systemic processes across the cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological systems. Among these, cardiovascular aging is particularly important due to its strong association with morbidity and mortality in industrialized societies. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the natural fluctuations in the time intervals between heartbeats and serves as an indicator of neural interorgan communication, particularly within the cardiac and neural systems, which is fundamentally underpinned by intercellular signaling. HRV captures the autonomic nervous system\u2019s regulation of cardiac function, reflecting the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Beyond its mechanistic significance, HRV provides a window into the organism\u2019s adaptive capacity to stress and the maintenance of homeostasis, encapsulating the interplay between cardiovascular, neural, and endocrine systems. Increasing evidence recognizes HRV as a predictor of survival across diverse populations, from patients with cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological disorders to the general population. Importantly, HRV is modifiable, making it a compelling target for interventions aimed at enhancing healthspan and lifespan. Among these interventions, nutritional strategies hold particular promise. This review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of key dietary factors including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, and calorie restriction on HRV modulation in human studies. These findings underscore the potential of nutritional approaches to mitigate the deleterious effects of cardiac and neural aging while promoting systemic resilience. HRV transcends its role as a biomarker, serving both as an independent outcome measure and a critical component of algorithmic models for evaluating the efficacy of aging-related interventions. By advancing our understanding of HRV and its modulation through diet, this review bridges fundamental aging biology with applied clinical strategies, highlighting its transformative potential in optimizing both quality of life and longevity.",

      "title": "Advancements in the application of brain-computer interfaces based on different paradigms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological condition that leads to the gradual loss of movement and communicative abilities, significantly diminishing the quality of life for affected individuals. Recent advancements in neuroscience and engineering have propelled the swift evolution of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which are now extensively utilised in medical rehabilitation, military applications, assistive technologies, and various other domains. As a communication medium facilitating direct interaction between the brain and the external world independent of the peripheral nervous system, BCI provides ALS patients with an innovative method for communication and control, offering unparalleled prospects for improving their quality of life. Recent collaborative endeavours among several specialists have markedly enhanced the precision and velocity of diverse BCI paradigms, signifying a breakthrough in BCI applications for ALS. Nonetheless, obstacles and constraints remain. This study methodically extracted pertinent literature from the Web of Science and PubMed databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Following stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies were identified. This data allows us to summarise the application results and current limitations of several BCI paradigms in motor control and communication, while delineating prospects in multimodal fusion and adaptive calibration. This review presents evidence-based references for the effective translation and application of BCI technology in ALS rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Towards A Cultural Intelligence and Values Inferences Quality Benchmark for Community Values and Common Knowledge",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.05176v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology, and thus, we have seen widespread adoption and use on software engineering teams. Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05536v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Constructing expressive and legible visualizations is a key activity for visualization designers. While numerous design guidelines exist, research on how specific graphical features affect perceived visual complexity remains limited. In this paper, we report on a crowdsourced study to collect human ratings of perceived complexity for diverse visualizations. Using these ratings as ground truth, we then evaluated three methods to estimate this perceived complexity: image analysis metrics, multilinear regression using manually coded visualization features, and automated feature extraction using a large language model (LLM). Image complexity metrics showed no correlation with human-perceived visualization complexity. Manual feature coding produced a reasonable predictive model but required substantial effort. In contrast, a zero-shot LLM (GPT-4o mini) demonstrated strong capabilities in both rating complexity and extracting relevant features. Our findings suggest that visualization complexity is truly in the eye of the beholder, yet can be effectively approximated using zero-shot LLM prompting, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the complexity of visualizations.

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05519v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI-generated video platforms rapidly advance, ethical challenges such as copyright infringement emerge. This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems. Based on the findings, we discuss governance challenges in Sora and how user negotiations inform future platform governance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05506v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for scaffolding students' English writing skills, but their effectiveness in real-time K-12 classrooms remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study examines the benefits and limitations of using LLMs as real-time learning support, considering how classroom constraints, such as diverse proficiency levels and limited time, affect their effectiveness. We conducted a deployment study with 157 eighth-grade students in a South Korean middle school English class over six weeks. Our findings reveal that while scaffolding improved students' ability to compose grammatically correct sentences, this step-by-step approach demotivated lower-proficiency students and increased their system reliance. We also observed challenges to classroom dynamics, where extroverted students often dominated the teacher's attention, and the system's assistance made it difficult for teachers to identify struggling students. Based on these findings, we discuss design guidelines for integrating LLMs into real-time writing classes as inclusive educational tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite years of research on testing the usability of mobile applications, our understanding of the issues their users experience still remains fragmented and underexplored. While most earlier studies has provided interesting insights, they have varying limitations in methodology, input diversity, and depth of analysis.On the contrary, this study employs a triangulation strategy, using two research methods (systematic literature review and interview) and two data sources (scholarly literature and expert knowledge) to explore the traits underlying usability issues. Our study contributes to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) by presenting a catalog of 16 usability issue categories, enriched with corresponding keywords and extended into a taxonomy, as well as a novel three-tier app-user-resource (AUR) classification system. At the first app level, usability issues arise from user interface design, as well as from efficiency, errors, and operability. At the second user level, they influence cognitive load, effectiveness, ease of use, learnability, memorability, and understandability. At the third resource level, usability issues stem from network quality and hardware, such as battery life, CPU speed, physical device button size and availability, RAM capacity, and screen size. The root cause of the usability issues is the user interface design. Detailed findings and takeaways for both researchers and practitioners are also discussed. Further research could focus on developing a measurement model for the identified variables to confirm the direction and strength of their relationships with perceived usability. Software vendors can also benefit by updating existing quality assurance programs, reviews and audits tools, as well as testing checklists.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05438v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an Extended Reality (XR) platform for immersive, interactive visualization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system extends beyond conventional 2D interfaces by visualizing both structured and unstructured patient data into a shared 3D environment, enabling intuitive exploration and real-time collaboration. The modular infrastructure integrates FHIR-based EHR data with volumetric medical imaging and AI-generated segmentation, ensuring interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05433v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Tactile graphics are widely used to present maps and statistical diagrams to blind and low vision (BLV) people, with accessibility guidelines recommending their use for graphics where spatial relationships are important. Their use is expected to grow with the advent of commodity refreshable tactile displays. However, in stark contrast to visual information graphics, we lack a clear understanding of the benefits that well-designed tactile information graphics offer over text descriptions for BLV people. To address this gap, we introduce a framework considering the three components of encoding, perception and cognition to examine the known benefits for visual information graphics and explore their applicability to tactile information graphics. This work establishes a preliminary theoretical foundation for the tactile-first design of information graphics and identifies future research avenues.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05397v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05389v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While audio guides can offer rich information about an exhibit, it is challenging for visitors to focus on specific exhibit details based only on the verbal description. We present \\textit{CLIO}, a tour guide robot with co-speech actions to direct visitors' visual attention and thus enhance the overall user engagement in a guided tour. \\textit{CLIO} is equipped with designed actions to engage visitors. It builds eye contact with the visitor through tracking a visitor's face and blinking its eyes, or orient their attention by its head movement and laser pointer. We further use a Large Language Model (LLM) to coordinate the designed actions with a given narrative script for exhibition. We conducted a user study to evaluate the \\textit{CLIO} system in a mock-up exhibition of historical photographs. We collected feedback from questionnaires and quantitative data from a mobile eye tracker. Experimental results validated that the engaging actions are well designed and demonstrated its efficacy in guiding visual attention of the visitors. It was evidenced that \\textit{CLIO} achieved an enhanced engagement compared to the baseline system with only audio guidance.",

      "title": "Systematically Evaluating Equivalent Purpose for Digital Maps",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.05310v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Digital geographic maps remain largely inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals (BLVIs), despite global legislation adopting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A critical gap exists in defining \"equivalent purpose\" for maps under WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1, which requires that non-text content provide a text alternative that serves the \"equivalent purpose\". This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating map accessibility, called the Map Equivalent-Purpose Framework (MEP Framework), defining purpose through three items (Generalized, Spatial Information, and Spatial Relationships), and establishing 15 measurable criteria for equivalent information communication. Eight text map representations were evaluated against visual map baselines using the proposed MEP Framework. Results show that legacy methods such as tables and turn-by-turn directions fail to meet the MEP Framework criteria, while Audiom Maps, Multi User Domain (MUD) Maps, and Audio Descriptions meet the criteria. The evaluation highlights the necessity of holistic, systematic approaches to ensure non-visual maps convey all generalized spatial information and relationships present in visual maps. The MEP Framework provides a replicable methodology for comprehensively assessing digital map accessibility, clarifying WCAG's \"equivalent purpose\", and guiding compliant and usable map creation. Compliant maps will support BLVIs' participation in map-dependent professions and civic engagement.",
