      "content": "Learning depends not only on the content of what we learn, but also on how we learn and on how experiences are structured over time. To investigate how task similarity and training regime interact during learning, we trained participants on spatial and conceptual learning tasks that shared either similar or distinct underlying structures, using either interleaved or blocked regimes. Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity. We also replicated our results using a neural network model, providing converging evidence for the computational principles governing the interplay between training regime and structural similarity in multi-task learning.",

      "title": "Familial Risk for Dementia, Cognitive Performance, and the Human Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit: A Study in the European Prevention of Alzheimers Disease cohort",
      "content": "The cerebellohippocampal (CBHP) circuit is increasingly implicated in episodic and spatial memory, yet its role in normal aging, dementia risk, and sex differences remains unclear. Structure and function in both the hippocampus and cerebellum have been linked to mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers Disease, and cognitive decline in healthy older adults. Literature on the CBHP circuit is largely limited to animal studies and small samples of young adults in the context of visuospatial abilities, underscoring the need for large, diverse aging cohorts to establish CB-HP connectivity as an early, translatable marker of neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate the CBHP circuit in the context of aging, dementia risk, behavior, and sex differences in healthy older adults to advance understanding of cognitive decline in the aging population. We explored this relationship in 857 healthy adults with and without a family history of dementia (aged 50-88, 59% female, 71% family history positive) using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsMRI) and behavioral assessments. We hypothesized that CB-HP functional connectivity (FC) would be lower with increased age, relate positively to cognitive performance, be lower in females positive for family history of dementia, and be lower in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-risk than cognitively normal (CN) participants with sex differences therein. We observed selective links between CBHP FC, cognition, and sex. MCI risk participants performed worse on spatial memory performances than CN, whereas CBHP FC showed opposite performance slopes by risk status, suggesting the CBHP circuit may function as a compensatory network for short-term recall. Sex differences were seen on cognitive tasks (delayed episodic memory and spatial tasks) and in CBHP a better visuospatial index was linked to greater FC in females, while males displayed an inverse relationship. Behavioral differences by familial dementia history were shown, although CBHP FC did not show effects here. Overall, CB-HP networks appear behaviorally silent in the aggregate but reveal risk and sex dependent relationships when memory demands and circuit nodes are considered.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "content": "IntroductionMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid progression. Early diagnosis remains particularly challenging, especially when CASPR2 antibodies are detected during the early stages of disease progression.Case presentationA 56-year-old female presented with chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. Serum analysis revealed the presence of CASPR2 antibodies. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum. The external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) indicated autonomic nerve dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, no clinical improvement was observed. During follow-up, symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction emerged, leading to a clinical established diagnosis of cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C).ConclusionIn the early stages of MSA, autonomic nerve dysfunction may not manifest clinically. Therefore, close follow-up is essential for accurate diagnosis. EAS-EMG exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subclinical autonomic dysfunction. Although the co-occurrence of MSA-C and high-titer (1:100) CASPR2-IgG is uncommon, this case highlights the critical importance of relying on the overall clinical presentation, rather than on isolated laboratory findings, to establish the primary diagnosis.",

      "title": "Enhancing the sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate biosensors by electrochemically roughening platinum microelectrodes",
      "content": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (GLU) are two key neurotransmitters (NTs) in processing, plasticity, memory, and network functions. High-sensitivity GABA and GLU biosensors are crucial for investigating the dysregulation of the GABA-GLU balance and improving animal models and human therapies for multiple neurological disorders. We have developed a novel biosensor that utilizes electrochemically roughened (ECR) platinum (Pt) microelectrodes to achieve the highest sensitivity in detecting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which serves as the detection signal for the biosensors. We evaluated three microelectrode surface activation techniques\u2014alcohol cleaning, electrochemical cleaning, and ECR\u2014and the main effects of the ECR pulses at varying frequencies (150\u20136,000\u202fHz) on biosensor sensitivity. ECR-treated microelectrodes reveal a non-linear relationship between the pulse frequency and the H2O2 adsorption, providing the highest sensitivity. Each frequency altered the microelectrode\u2019s roughness differently, resulting in unique surface morphologies and pore geometries, as well as the formation of surface impurities within the pores. The primary factors influencing Pt\u2019s electrocatalytic activity are the pore geometry and the facile Pt kinetics, and not the electroactive area or the impurities in the pores. Particularly, pore geometries at low (250\u202fHz) and high frequencies (2,500\u202fHz) contribute to the highest H2O2 adsorption and sensitivity (6,810\u202f\u00b1\u202f124\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122), the highest value reported in the literature. The EIS model reveals that ECR-treated microelectrodes exhibit heterogeneous pores and partially smooth, flat regions between the pores, with the catalytic activity primarily occurring in the pore walls rather than the flat regions. The EIS data indicate superior electrical conductivity in the pore walls, which enhances the GABA and GLU peak sensitivities to 45\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.4\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122 and 1,510\u202f\u00b1\u202f47.0\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122, respectively. The corresponding limits of detection are 1.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fnM and 12.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.73\u202fnM (n\u202f=\u202f3). These findings underscore the significance of ECR in enhancing the performance of Pt MEA-based enzymatic biosensors, thereby paving the way for advanced, ultrasensitive biosensors for neurochemical monitoring in challenging in vivo applications.",

      "title": "The course of mechanical allodynia differs between forelimb innervation territories following median nerve injury in the rat",
      "content": "Functional deficits and chronic neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injuries pose major clinical challenges. For preclinical evaluation of novel treatments, reliable methods for assessing functional recovery and robust animal models with high translational potential are crucial. Following peripheral nerve injury reinnervation of denervated target organs is not only achieved by regeneration of the original nerve, but also by collateral sprouting of adjacent intact nerves. In this study motor and sensory recovery was analyzed in a rat model of median nerve injury and repair using distinct functional test. Ten male Wistar rats underwent bilateral median nerve transection. In one forelimb the nerve was repaired using epineurial sutures, while in the contralateral forelimb the nerve remained unrepaired and served as internal control. For 12 weeks post-surgery, the Von Frey Test, the Grasping Test and CatWalk gait analysis were performed weekly. Sensory reinnervation and mechanical allodynia were evaluated with the Von Frey Test in distinct predefined test areas considering the innervation of the forepaws, allowing for indirect assessment of collateral nerve sprouting. Early mechanical allodynia developed within two weeks after median nerve injury in all innervation areas of the forepaw. This was associated with significant alterations of Print Width, Print Area, Duty Cycle, Swing Speed, Swing Time and Stand Index. From week 6 onward late mechanical allodynia paralleled with gait improvements and return of measurable grasping strength on the reconstructed side. The methodology utilized in our study, is feasible to comprehensively assess motor and sensory nerve regeneration paving the way for valid evaluation of future therapeutic strategies in a rat median nerve injury model.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",
