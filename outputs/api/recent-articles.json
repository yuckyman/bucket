      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Parsers start in a supervised mode where document types are validated by an LLM only when confidence is low (with a carefully monitored audit log\u2014helps balance speed with processing hundreds or thousands of bills for the first run).</p> <p>As a pattern becomes stable within a particular context (e.g., a specific committee), it \u201cgraduates\u201d to autonomous operation.</p> <p>This cuts LLM usage out entirely after patterns are established.</p> <ol> <li>A declarative action-node system</li> </ol> <p>Each event type is defined by:</p> <ul> <li>regex patterns</li> <li>extractor functions</li> <li>normalizers</li> <li>and optional priority weights</li> </ul> <p>Adding a new event type requires registering patterns, not modifying core engine code.</p> <ol> <li>A timeline engine with tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>The engine reconstructs \u201dtenure windows\u201d (who had custody of a bill when), by modeling event sequences such as referrals, discharges, reports, hearings, and extensions.</p> <p>This allows accurate downstream logic such as:</p> <ul> <li>notice windows</li> <li>action deadlines</li> <li>gap detection</li> <li>duration calculations</li> </ul> <ol> <li>A high-performance decaying URL cache</li> </ol> <p>The HTTP layer uses a memory-bounded hybrid LRU/LFU eviction strategy (`hit_count / time_since_access`) with request deduplication and ETag/Last-Modified validation.</p> <p>This speeds up repeated processing by ~3-5x.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This project is intended for:</p> <ul> <li>developers working with messy, unstructured, real-world text data</li> <li>engineers designing parser pipelines, state machines, or ETL systems</li> <li>researchers experimenting with pattern extraction, timeline reconstruction, or document normalization</li> <li>anyone interested in building declarative, extensible parsing systems</li> <li>civic-tech or open-data engineers (OpenStates-style pipelines)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most existing alternatives (e.g., OpenStates, BillTrack, general-purpose scrapers) extract events for normalization and reporting, but don\u2019t (to my knowledge) evaluate these events against a ruleset. This approach works for tracking bill events as they\u2019re updated, but doesn\u2019t yield enough data to reliably evaluate committee-level deadline compliance (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t their intended purpose anyway).</p> <p>How this project differs:</p> <ol> <li>Timeline-first architecture</li> </ol> <p>Rather than detecting events in isolation, it reconstructs a full chronological sequence and applies logic after timeline creation.</p> <ol> <li>Declarative parser configuration</li> </ol> <p>New event and document types can be added by registering patterns; no engine modification required.</p> <ol> <li>Context-aware inference</li> </ol> <p>Missing committee/dates are inferred from prior context (e.g., latest referral), not left blank.</p> <ol> <li>Confidence-gated parser graduation</li> </ol> <p>Parsers statistically \u201clearn\u201d which contexts they succeed in, and reduce LLM/manual interaction over time.</p> <ol> <li>Formal tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>Custody analysis allows logic that would be extremely difficult in a traditional scraper.</p> <p>In short, this isn\u2019t a keyword matcher, rather, it\u2019s a state machine for real-world text with an adaptive parsing pipeline built around it and a ruleset engine for calculating and applying deadline evaluations.</p> <p><strong>Code / Docs</strong></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/\">https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/</a></p> <p><strong>Looking for Feedback</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d love feedback from Python engineers who have experience with:</p> <ul> <li>parser design</li> <li>messy-data ETL pipelines</li> <li>declarative rule systems</li> <li>timeline/state-machine architectures</li> <li>document normalization and caching</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeaconHillTracker\"> /u/BeaconHillTracker </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[comments]</a></span>",
