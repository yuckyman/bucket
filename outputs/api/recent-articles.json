      "title": "Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS): An Intuitive, No-Code, Scalable Pipeline for Long Duration Calcium Imaging",
      "content": "Miniscope calcium imaging provides a unique window into the activity of neurons during behavior while enabling spatial localization of individual cells across time. Despite its potential to revolutionize in vivo imaging alongside the rise of optogenetic tools, miniscopes remain underutilized. This gap may stem from the lack of an easy-to-use preprocessing software tailored to miniscope data. To address this need, we developed the first no-code end-to-end scalable pipeline for preprocessing large miniscope recordings: the Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS). MPS is the first implementation of Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) with Nonnegative Double Singular Value Decomposition (NNDSVD) initialization, multi-lasso segmentation, and parallelized temporal and spatial updates, enabling analysis of recordings exceeding three hours on a standard hardware. We tested a large dataset consisting of 28 operant behavior sessions (77 hrs, 7.26 TB of video data) on a single workstation. MPS completed the analysis in 55.6 hrs, (averaging 0.72 minute of processing time per minute of recording), which is 10-20X faster than traditional pipelines. Packaged as an easy downloadable plug-and-play software with a graphical user interface and requiring no coding or Git experience, MPS lowers the barrier to miniscope analysis while improving on current methodologies.",

      "title": "Orthographic training finetunes a neuronal letter position code in primate visual cortex",
      "content": "Reading is an acquired skill that enhances brain activity in human visual cortex and is thought to repurpose preexisting ventral visual circuitry for the fast parallel processing of letter strings. However, the neuronal code underlying position-invariant written word recognition remains elusive. Here, we examined this issue in a macaque monkey model before and after orthographic training. Based on prior simulations of reading acquisition in a convolutional neural network model of the ventral visual pathway, we hypothesized the existence of neurons sensitive to both specific letters and their ordinal position within the word, which should be enhanced by orthographic training. By wirelessly recorded neural activity from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaque monkeys trained on orthographic tasks over five successive days, we indeed discovered IT neurons tuned to letters and sensitive to either ordinal or retinotopic positions. Ordinal units existed prior to training, but their responses were enhanced after training, matching with behavioral improvements in word recognition. These findings support the neuronal recycling hypothesis and demonstrate, at the single-cell level, how reading refines pre-existing neural circuits to facilitate fluent word recognition.",

      "title": "Impact of visual distractors in virtual reality environments on sustained attention behavioral performance and EEG characteristics",
      "content": "IntroductionThis study investigates the effects of visual distractors in virtual reality (VR) environments on sustained attention, focusing on how visual distraction modulates neural mechanisms of attentional allocation and regulation.MethodsBehavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from 66 participants performing a Go/No-go continuous performance test (CPT) in a virtual classroom under conditions with (Y-D) and without (N-D) visual distractors. We analyzed behavioral performance (commission/omission errors, multipress, reaction time), event-related potential (P300) characteristics (latency, amplitude), and nonlinear dynamics (sample entropy, fuzzy entropy) of the EEG signals.ResultsBehavioral results revealed that visual distractors significantly increased commission errors, omission errors, and multipress (all p < 0.001), with no significant difference in reaction time. EEG analysis demonstrated that distractors significantly prolonged P300 latency, particularly at CPz, Pz, and Oz electrodes, and increased P300 amplitude at Fz, FCz, and Oz. Furthermore, both sample entropy and fuzzy entropy values were significantly higher under distraction conditions in the frontal, central, and parietal regions.DiscussionThese findings indicate that visual distractors disrupt cognitive processes related to visual information integration, attentional control, and decision-making, leading to decreased behavioral performance and increased neural complexity. This study deepens the understanding of the neural mechanisms of attention processing under ecological conditions and provides a scientific basis for optimizing educational environments and developing attention assessment tools based on neuroengineering.",

      "content": "IntroductionObserving the actions of others activates the action observation network (AON). Although previous studies have reported that motor experience and visual familiarity with an observed action can modulate the AON activity, the response of the AON to the observation of unusual walking patterns remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the brain activity induced by observing walking in a split-belt condition, where the left and right treadmill belt speeds differ.MethodsWe examined the brain activity during the observation of video clips showing normal walking under a tied condition (the same left and right treadmill speeds) as well as walking during the initial and late periods of a split-belt condition using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 19 healthy adults. The step lengths of the actor walking in the video clips were asymmetric during the initial period of the split-belt condition and nearly symmetric during the tied condition and late period of the split-belt condition.Results and discussionObserving the walking video clips activated broad regions of the occipito-temporo-parietal and frontal cortices, irrespective of the clip conditions. The contrasts between the conditions revealed that observing walking in the initial and late periods of the split-belt condition induced stronger activation in a subset of the AON than in the tied condition. These results suggest that observing unusual walking patterns under asymmetric speed condition induces a stronger AON activity than normal walking.",

      "title": "Peri-Head Distance Coding in the Mouse Brainstem",
      "content": "Perceiving object distance in peri-personal space (PPS) is essential for guiding movement and avoiding danger, yet how early somatosensory circuits extract distance information from tactile inputs remains unclear. Here, we investigate how second-order neurons in the mouse whisker brainstem encode peri-head distance. Using in vivo extracellular recordings in awake mice in a naturalistic wall-passing paradigm, we find brainstem neurons employ two distance-coding schemes: a \"proximity\" code, where firing increases monotonically as objects approach the face; and a \"map\" code, where neurons exhibit peak tuning at specific distances to collectively tile peri-head space. The map code outperforms proximity code in population decoding of distance. Perturbation experiments revealed multi-whisker integration and intersubnuclear inhibition contribute to the generation of map-like tuning. These findings highlight the previously underappreciated brainstem circuit for sensory code transformation, suggesting inhibition acts as a neural comparator, subtracting peripheral inputs with differing sensitivity to transform proximity-based sensory inputs into a map-like representation of PPS.",

      "title": "Visual feedback adaptation enhances arm-posture coordination during floor-surface perturbations",
      "content": "BackgroundMaintaining postural stability during perturbations requires coordinated sensorimotor and interjoint coordination. This study investigated the effects of different feedback modalities (knowledge of results [KR] and continuous visual feedback) on postural adaptation during floor surface perturbations while standing.MethodsNineteen healthy young adults (mean age: 23.1 \u00b1 1.2 years; 12 males) performed an arm-holding task while standing on a backward-translating force platform under five phases: baseline test, KR adaptation training, post-KR adaptation (P-KRA) test, visual adaptation training, and post-visual adaptation (P-VA) test. Endpoint position variability, center of pressure (COP), center of mass (COM), margin of stability (MOS), and interjoint coordination were compared among Baseline, P-KRA, and P-VA using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance.ResultsCompared to Baseline, endpoint position variability was significantly reduced in the P-VA at both perturbation offset (8.97 \u00b1 1.04 mm vs. 15.35 \u00b1 1.52 mm, p = 0.006) and 1.5 s after offset (14.39 \u00b1 1.02 mm vs. 19.73 \u00b1 1.71 mm, p = 0.027). The MOS at 1.5 s after offset was lower in P-VA (39.33 \u00b1 4.28 mm) than in Baseline (58.04 \u00b1 4.53 mm, p = 0.011), and the minimum MOS was significantly smaller in P-VA (32.20 \u00b1 4.38 mm vs. 50.59 \u00b1 4.26 mm, p = 0.011). Anticipatory COP displacement at onset in P-VA was significantly increased (14.11 \u00b1 1.46 mm vs. 6.20 \u00b1 0.89 mm, p < 0.001) and reduced peak forward COP displacement (89.42 \u00b1 2.00 mm vs. 110.18 \u00b1 3.35 mm, p < 0.001). The time to stability was shorter in P-VA (1,266.42 \u00b1 68.29 ms) than in Baseline (1,525.78 \u00b1 66.11 ms, p = 0.017). The cross-correlation coefficient between the elbow and ankle joints was significantly higher in P-VA than in Baseline (0.98 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 0.89 \u00b1 0.04, p = 0.014).ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that continuous visual feedback adaptation may enhance arm-posture coordination during external perturbations in healthy young adults.",

      "title": "The intersection of near-death experiences (NDEs) and traumatic brain injury (TBI): neurobiological, phenomenological, and creative implications",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and near-death experiences (NDEs) represent profound disruptions in brain function, often associated with dramatic changes in consciousness, self-perception, and behavior. While these events are typically studied for their pathological consequences, a growing body of evidence suggests they may also trigger unexpected cognitive and creative enhancements in a subset of individuals. We explore the intersection between TBI, NDEs, and the emergence of heightened artistic expression, integrating findings from neuroanatomy, neuropathology, genetics, and phenomenology. We examine how alterations in key brain networks - such as the default mode network, frontoparietal circuits, and limbic regions - may underpin shifts in self-awareness, emotion processing, and symbolic thinking, which are frequently reported after NDEs or severe brain trauma. Additionally, we discuss the potential role of neuroplasticity, diaschisis, and compensatory reorganization in facilitating novel patterns of cognition and creative output following injury. Genetic factors potentially influencing susceptibility to such transformations are considered, alongside evolutionary perspectives on why these rare post-injury enhancements may occur. By synthesizing clinical cases, neuroscientific studies, and first-person accounts, we argue that certain brain injuries and altered states of consciousness can function as catalysts for reconfiguration of cognitive and emotional systems, leading to emergent artistic abilities or intensified creative insight. These phenomena challenge traditional dichotomies between damage and function, pathology and creativity, and invite new frameworks for understanding the plastic potential of the human brain. This overview-hypothesis driven article aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how the mind and brain interact under extreme conditions and how these interactions may unlock hidden reservoirs of human potential. The paper highlights the need for systematic research into post-traumatic and NDE-related cognitive changes, not only to improve clinical outcomes but also to broaden our knowledge of human consciousness and creativity.",

      "title": "Energy Landscape Analysis Reveals Thalamic Modulation of Brain State Transitions During Movie Watching",
      "content": "Understanding how large-scale brain networks dynamically coordinate during complex, real-world experiences remains a crucial topic in contemporary neuroscience. Leveraging naturalistic paradigm, this study employed energy landscape modeling to characterize the temporal dynamics of brain state transitions and their functional significance. Using the Sherlock fMRI dataset, we identified two dominant brain states: a perception- and attention-oriented state, and an introspective, integrative state, each associated with distinct canonical brain networks. State transitions were differentially associated with the recruitment of these networks and manifested as either the \"easy\" or \"hard\" route, depending on the energy required for the transition. Notably, we demonstrated that the probability of specific state transitions robustly predicted inter-subject correlation within three clusters: subcortical-rich, salience/attention-rich, and DMN-rich regions. This indicates that flexible reorganization of cortical networks underlies shared neural engagement during ecologically valid experiences. Critically, the thalamus emerged as a central modulator, displaying activity changes and dynamic nucleus-specific thalamocortical connectivity changes tied to distinct transition profiles. Together, our findings shed light on the energetic and network mechanisms that orchestrate brain dynamics during naturalistic cognition and underscore the pivotal role of cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in governing flexible, collective neural responses to richly structured real-life stimuli.",

      "title": "Micronuclear collapse under oxidative stress drives amphisome-mediated export of DNA in Parkinson disease",
      "content": "The diversity of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations and their impact on intercellular communication are increasingly recognized, but how organelle dysfunction shapes EV content in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Mitochondrial and lysosomal functional defects are hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD). Here we uncover a novel pathway linking this dysfunctional axis to EV remodeling and immune activation. We show that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce genomic instability and micronuclei formation in PD fibroblasts, with ruptured micronuclei being sequestered into amphisomes and exported through small EVs. These EVs are enriched in oxidized mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which potently stimulate microglial inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, this work identifies micronuclei not as passive byproducts of genome instability but as active intermediates in EV cargo loading. Importantly, treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant AntiOxCIN4 elicited a mitohormetic response, enhancing ATM - mediated DNA damage repair, restoring mitochondrial dynamics, and improving lysosomal function. This reduced the incorporation of oxidized DNA into EVs and blunted their pro- inflammatory activity. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction drives the release of DNA-enriched EVs that fuel neuroinflammation in a neurodegenerative context. Targeting mitochondrial quality control to limit oxidized cargo in EVs emerges as a potential strategy to mitigate early inflammatory events in PD.",

      "title": "Behavioural and Physiological Signatures of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Models in Mice",
      "content": "The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm is one of the most widely used preclinical models to investigate the role of stress in the neurobiology of depression and to evaluate potential antidepressant therapies, owing to its strong translational relevance. However, despite its extensive use, substantial discrepancies and concerns regarding the reproducibility of CUMS outcomes persist in the literature, with many studies reporting inconsistent or unreliable results. In the present comparative study, we implemented several CUMS protocols in mice that differed in the intensity and duration of stress exposure, and systematically evaluated the resulting pathophysiological and behavioural alterations associated with depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes. We found that progressive escalation in stress intensity and frequency, as well as prolonged exposure, induced increasingly robust disease-related behavioural and physiological changes, including depression- and anxiety-like behaviours, adrenal hypertrophy, and reduced body weight gain.. Moreover, social isolation emerged as a major contributing factor exacerbating stress-induced deficits. Altogether, data suggest that a multidimensional assessment of the behavioural impairments is critical to reinforce the physiological changes indicative of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Differences in individual stress susceptibility, stressor intensity, frequency, and housing conditions are key determinants of CUMS outcomes. Therefore, precise, detailed, and transparent reporting of protocol parameters is critical to enhance reproducibility and enable meaningful comparisons across studies.",
