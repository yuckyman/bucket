      "title": "Light-inducible proximity labelling in vivo captures sex-specific RNA at excitatory synapses",
      "content": "Local RNA regulation is essential for synaptic plasticity, yet the full repertoire of RNA species and associated isoforms within specific synaptic compartments in vivo has yet to be determined. Existing RNA profiling approaches lack the spatial and temporal precision needed to resolve RNA repertoires restricted to cell-type specific synaptic compartments. To overcome this challenge, we developed PSD95 Haloseq, a light induced proximity labelling technique that, when combined with long read sequencing, selectively captures all post-synaptic full length RNA species in the excitatory post synaptic compartment. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sex differences in RNA expression within excitatory synapses following exposure to an associative fear learning task in C57/Bl6 mice. We found dramatic sex differences in pseudogene and protein coding RNA expression, which are most abundant in females, with males exhibiting multiple noncoding RNA classes, including lncRNA, snoRNA, and rRNA. Females generally showed more 3' UTR expression, and there was widespread differential exon usage following fear conditioning, including 179 isoforms in males, 69 in females, with no significant gene level differential expression, indicating that behavioural state modifies sex specific isoform usage rather than overall transcript abundance. Our discovery that synaptic RNA composition is dynamic, sexually dimorphic, and profoundly shaped by experience, offers new insight into previously inaccessible mechanisms underlying sex differences in fear-related learning and memory. PSD95 Halo seq is therefore a powerful method for the precise spatiotemporal identification of compartment- and cell type specific RNA.",

      "title": "Chondroitin 4-sulphate depletion enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in aging",
      "content": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialised extracellular matrix structures enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are key regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Aging is characterised by a shift in chondroitin sulphate composition toward increased chondroitin-4-sulfation (C4S) and reduced C6S, a pattern associated with declining cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigated how selective reduction of C4S affects PNN structure, PV-interneuron connectivity, and cognitive performance across the lifespan. Conditional deletion of the C4-sulfotransferase Chst11 markedly reduced C4S levels and diminished dendritic PNN complexity while preserving somatic PNN structure. This partial destabilisation of PNNs increased excitatory synaptic input onto PV interneurons in both young and aged mice, without major alterations in basal hippocampal transmission or long-term potentiation. Behaviourally, Chst11 knockout mice showed robust and persistent protection against age-related cognitive decline. Working memory performance remained stable across aging, short-term spatial memory was enhanced from early adulthood onward, and object recognition memory was significantly prolonged at all retention delays, even in old age. Sociability and social novelty preference were also preserved longer in aging knockouts compared with controls. These improvements occurred despite an overall preservation of PNN architecture, indicating that modifying sulphation rather than removing CSPGs is sufficient to enhance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that reducing C4S through Chst11 deletion confers long-lasting enhancements in cognitive function and mitigates aging-related decline. Targeting CS-GAG sulphation patterns may therefore represent a promising strategy for maintaining cognitive resilience and restoring plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "title": "Diurnality reconfigures circadian network dynamics in the suprachiasmatic nucleus",
      "content": "Diurnal and nocturnal mammals occupy opposite temporal niches, but whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, follows the same intrinsic rules for timing adjustment and network coordination across species is unknown. Because SCN clock gene rhythms and population-level activity measurements look broadly similar across species, the prevailing interpretation in comparative studies has been that temporal niche differences are implemented upstream or downstream of the SCN. However, these coarse readouts do not test how clock resetting depends on circadian phase or how neuronal timing is coordinated across SCN space. Here, we combined long-duration ex vivo SCN recordings with optogenetic stimulation to compare SCN network dynamics in the nocturnal mouse (Mus musculus) and the diurnal four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). Rhabdomys SCN molecular clock rhythms exhibited a longer intrinsic period and, under the same daily stimulation protocol, converged on a larger absolute phase angle relative to the stimulus. Molecular clock phase response curves differed in overall structure across circadian time between species, including pronounced early subjective day delays in Rhabdomys when Mus responses were minimal. Phase mapping of single-cell SCN calcium rhythms revealed species-specific spatial timing organization, with a graded dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral phase progression in Rhabdomys and a sharper transition in Mus. The Mus and Rhabdomys SCN can thus appear similar by coarse readouts yet diverge in phase-dependent molecular clock resetting and network timing organization. These results indicate that models placing temporal niche divergence solely outside the SCN are mechanistically incomplete.",

      "title": "Divergent Electrophysiological Responses in the Human Hippocampus During Verbal Memory Processing",
      "content": "The profile of electrophysiological responses in the human hippocampus (HPC) during verbal memory processing has remained complex and unclear. Here, we studied 26 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes across 187 HPC sites (50% left, 2-18 per patient). During memory encoding and retrieval, a subset of HPC responsive sites demonstrated increased ripple events, along with elevated high-frequency (HFA >50 Hz), and low-frequency (LFA 1-8 Hz) activity. A nearly equal number of sites showed no changes in ripple rate but increased LFA power and a delayed response-locked decrease in HFA power. More importantly, both successful encoding as well as recognition of remembered words were strongly associated with the coordination of the timing of LFA and HFA increases across the two clusters of responsive HPC sites. Using direct cortical electrical stimulations, we confirmed overlapping, but partially distinct, cortical connections to the functionally distinct HPC clusters. Our findings suggest a mesoscale mosaic functional organization within the human HPC where adjacent sites with divergent electrophysiological responses may have specialized roles during verbal memory processing. More importantly, our findings suggest that successful human memory depends on the coordination of the timing of low and high frequency local fields generated across these functionally divergent neuronal population sites.",
