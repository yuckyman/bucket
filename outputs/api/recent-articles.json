      "title": "The effect of extended early rehabilitation on the treatment outcome of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

      "title": "Imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning for sparse badminton strikes via dynamic trajectory generation",
      "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

      "title": "Fully Endoscopic Microvascular Decompression for Hemifacial Spasm Using 2-Dimensional/3-Dimensional Endoscopy: Clinical Analysis of 204 Cases",
      "content": "CONCLUSION: Fully endoscopic MVD for HFS offers wide visualization of the neurovascular conflict area and minimizes brain injury caused by retraction. Once technical proficiency is achieved, surgical outcomes are favorable and complications are low. Despite the drawbacks such as a slight sense of vertigo during use and high cost, the 3D endoscope provides a stereoscopic view. More research is essential to verify its role in MVD surgery.",

While ocular screening of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine is important, retinal toxicity with a low dose and short duration of use remains rare. Clinicians must retain a broad differential diagnosis in the assessment of patients with bull's eye maculopathy.",

      "content": "Image deblurring and compression-artifact removal are both ill-posed inverse problems in low-level vision tasks. So far, although numerous image deblurring and compression-artifact removal methods have been proposed respectively, the research for explicit handling blur and compression-artifact coexisting degradation image (BCDI) is rare. In the BCDI, image contents will be damaged more seriously, especially for edges and texture details. Therefore, the restoration of the BCDI is a more severe...",

      "content": "Low-coverage sequencing refers to sequencing DNA of individuals to a low depth of coverage (e.g., 0.5X) and imputing that sequence to genomic sequence based on reference haplotypes from individuals sequenced to high depth of coverage (e.g., \u2265 10X). It has been proposed as an alternative to genotyping by SNP arrays. At least one commercial product based on it is available for agricultural species. Concerns limiting adoption in its current form are: 1) the cost of storing the huge volume of data...",
