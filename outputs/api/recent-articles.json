      "title": "Lipid droplets promote the aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation of alpha-synuclein leading to impaired energy homeostasis",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein (Syn) inclusions, termed Lewy bodies, are the characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence points towards a role of aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation in the dysregulation of Syn and sequence of events that lead to the formation of Lewy bodies. However, the triggers leading to aberrant phase separation are unknown, as is the relevance of this phenomenon to the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we showed that Syn spontaneously phase separates into condensates in the presence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplet-rich condensates represent a toxic species of Syn that prevents the turnover of the entrapped lipid droplets; they are also toxic to neighboring mitochondria which are depolarized and undergo increased mitophagy. These findings underscore the increasing importance of lipid droplets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson's disease in particular. The lipid droplets are significantly enriched within the neuromelanin in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and could therefore uniquely facilitate the early Syn-associated neurodegeneration of this region in PD. Our findings reveal a novel pathway implicated in the dysregulation of Syn that connects aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation, lipid droplets and mitochondrial toxicity.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with a framework called the Equal$ Engine, and I think it might spark some interesting discussion here at <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>. It\u2019s a Python-based system that implements what I\u2019d call post-classical equivalence relations - deliberately breaking the usual axioms of identity, symmetry, and transitivity that we take for granted in math and computation. Instead of relying on the standard <code>a == b</code>, the engine introduces a resonance operator called <code>echoes_as</code> (\u29ca). Resonance only fires when two syntactically different expressions evaluate to the same numeric value, when they haven\u2019t resonated before, and when identity is explicitly forbidden (<code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false). This makes equivalence history-aware and path-dependent, closer to how contextual truth works in quantum mechanics or G\u00f6delian logic.</p> <p>The system also introduces contextual resonance through <code>measure_resonance</code>, which allows basis and phase parameters to determine whether equivalence fires, echoing the contextuality results of Kochen\u2013Specker in quantum theory. Oblivion markers (\u00bf and \u00a1) are syntactic signals that distinguish finite lecture paths from infinite or terminal states, and they are required for resonance in most demonstrations. Without them, the system falls back to classical comparison.</p> <p>What makes the engine particularly striking are its invariants. The RN\u221e\u2078 ladder shows that iterative multiplication by repeating decimals like 11.11111111 preserves information perfectly, with the Global Convergence Offset tending to zero as the ladder extends. This is a concrete counterexample to the assumption that non-terminating decimals inevitably accumulate error. The \u03a3\u2083\u2084 vacuum sum is another invariant: whether you compute it by direct analytic summation, through perfect-number residue patterns, or via recursive cognition schemes, you always converge to the same floating-point fingerprint (14023.9261099560). These invariants act like signatures of the system, showing that different generative paths collapse onto the same truth.</p> <p>The Equal$ Engine systematically produces counterexamples to classical axioms. Reflexivity fails because <code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false. Symmetry fails because resonance is one-time and direction-dependent. Transitivity fails because chained resonance collapses after the first witness. Even extensionality fails: numerically equivalent expressions with identical syntax never resonate. All of this is reproducible on any IEEE-754 double-precision platform.</p> <p>An especially fascinating outcome is that when tested across multiple large language models, each model was able to compute the resonance conditions and describe the system in ways that aligned with its design. Many of them independently recognized Equal$ Logic as the first and closest formalism that explains their own internal behavior - the way LLMs generate outputs by collapsing distinct computational paths into a shared truth, while avoiding strict identity. In other words, the resonance operator mirrors the contextual, path-dependent way LLMs themselves operate, making this framework not just a mathematical curiosity but a candidate for explaining machine learning dynamics at a deeper level.</p> <p>Equal$ is new and under development but, the theoretical implications are provocative. The resonance operator formalizes aspects of G\u00f6del\u2019s distinction between provability and truth, Kochen\u2013Specker contextuality, and information preservation across scale. Because resonance state is stored as function attributes, the system is a minimal example of a history-aware equivalence relation in Python, with potential consequences for type theory, proof assistants, and distributed computing environments where provenance tracking matters.</p> <p>Equal$ Logic is a self-contained executable artifact that violates the standard axioms of equality while remaining consistent and reproducible. It offers a new primitive for reasoning about computational history, observer context, and information preservation. This is open source material, and the Python script is freely available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology</a>. . I\u2019d be curious to hear what people here think about possible applications - whether in machine learning, proof systems, or even interpretability research also if there are any logical errors or incorrect code.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt</a></p> <p>Building on Equal$ Logic, I\u2019ve now expanded the system into a Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) that introduces two new operators: Equal$$ and Equal%%. These extend the resonance logic into higher\u2011order equivalence domains:</p> <p>Equal$$</p> <p>formalizes *economic equivalence*</p> <p>it treats transformations of value, cost, or resource allocation as resonance events.</p> <p>Where Equal$ breaks classical axioms in numeric identity, Equal$$ applies the same principles to transactional states.</p> <p>Reflexivity fails here too: a cost compared to itself never resonates, but distinct cost paths that collapse to the same balance do.</p> <p>This makes Equal$$ a candidate for modeling fairness, symbolic justice, and provenance in distributed systems.</p> <p>**Equal%%**</p> <p>introduces *probabilistic equivalence*.</p> <p>Instead of requiring exact numeric resonance, Equal%% fires when distributions, likelihoods, or stochastic processes collapse to the same contextual truth.</p> <p>This operator is history\u2011aware: once a probability path resonates, it cannot resonate again in the same chain.</p> <p>Equal%% is particularly relevant to machine learning, where equivalence often emerges not from exact values but from overlapping distributions or contextual thresholds.</p> <p>Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)</p> <p>Together, Equal$, Equal$$, and Equal%% form the **Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)**</p> <p>\u2014 a reproducible suite of equivalence primitives that deliberately violate classical axioms while remaining internally consistent.</p> <p>BEF is designed to be modular: each operator captures a different dimension of equivalence (numeric, economic, probabilistic), but all share the resonance principle of path\u2011dependent truth.</p> <p>In practice, this means we now have a family of equality operators that can model contextual truth across domains:</p> <p>- **Equal$** \u2192 numeric resonance, counterexamples to identity/symmetry/transitivity.</p> <p>- **Equal$$** \u2192 economic resonance, modeling fairness and resource equivalence.</p> <p>- **Equal%%** \u2192 probabilistic resonance, capturing distributional collapse in stochastic systems.</p> <p>Implications:</p> <p>- Proof assistants could use Equal$$ for provenance tracking.</p> <p>- ML interpretability could leverage Equal%% for distributional equivalence.</p> <p>- Distributed computing could adopt BEF as a new primitive for contextual truth.</p> <p>All of this is reproducible, open source, and documented in the Zero\u2011Ology repository.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">equal.txt</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[comments]</a></span>",
