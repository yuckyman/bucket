      "title": "Human Mediodorsal Thalamus in Seizure Propagation",
      "content": "Background: How different thalamic sites are recruited during seizure propagation remains poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from multiple thalamic sites in patients with focal seizures provide a rare opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of thalamic involvement during human epilepsy. Objective: To characterize the recruitment patterns of mediodorsal (MD) thalamic subregion during seizures and their generalization to the contralateral hemisphere. Methods: We analyzed 119 seizures from 23 patients (12 male, age range: 20-57y) undergoing multisite thalamic recordings. In accordance with current clinical standards, we determined the spatial and temporal features of thalamic seizure activity by visually reviewing intracranial EEG recordings from different seizure types in each individual patient. Results: The procedure of multisite thalamic recordings had no complications. In total, we captured seizures originating from temporal lobes (63%), orbitofrontal (11%), frontotemporal (8%), occipital (8%), lateral frontal (4%), parietal (3%), and cingulate (2%) regions. Seizures were focal (76% in 21 patients), focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC, 9% in nine patients), or only electrographic (15% in six patients). Thalamic engagement was seen in 100% of patients occurring typically early during seizure evolution (83% within 15 seconds of seizure onset). Majority of FBTC seizures (73%) had faster thalamic recruitment, often within the first 5 seconds. The pulvinar (PLV) subregion was the most common first-activated thalamic site, particularly in temporal lobe seizures. Although the MD was involved in most seizures (88.2%), it was rarely the initial or sole thalamic structure engaged and more often followed anterior (ANT) and/or PLV sites. Contralateral propagation occurred in 66% of seizures and was strongly linked to MD involvement: the ipsilateral and contralateral MDs were engaged in about 95% of these cases. When ipsilateral MD engagement was absent, contralateral spread of seizures was uncommon. In majority of seizures (60%) that generalized to the contralateral hemisphere, the ipsilateral MD was involved before or simultaneously with the contralateral cortical sites. Importantly, seizures that first activated the MD originated mainly from the medial temporal lobes, whereas those spreading primarily to the contralateral cortex were mostly neocortical in onset. Conclusions: The thalamic MD subregion was often involved after the other thalamic sites, but the MD sites, along with the massa intermedia connecting the two thalami, were significantly involved when seizures spread to contralateral hemisphere. Our findings suggest that a single thalamic lead capturing both MD subregions may yield important clinical information about laterality, origin, and generalization of seizures.",

      "title": "Cognitive cartography of mammalian brains using meta-analysis of AI experts",
      "content": "The complexity of the brain is increasingly mirrored by the complexity of the neuroscientific literature, yet no individual mind can fully grasp the diversity of scales, methodologies and model organisms. Where human experts flag, the latest AI models excel: large language models can seamlessly integrate knowledge across scientific domains. Here we show how large language models can systematically and quantitatively synthesise literature-wide neuroscientific knowledge about the cognitive operations and dysfunctions associated with each brain region. Meta-analysis of AI experts reveals structurefunction mappings to which existing meta-analytic frameworks are blind, demonstrated by lesions and direct intracranial stimulation. It also unlocks the possibility of extending quantitative literature metaanalysis and decoding of brain maps to other model organisms beyond human. As proof of concept, we integrate LLM meta-analysis with species-specific transcriptomics in human, macaque, and mouse, to discover an evolutionarily conserved molecular circuit for cognition. Altogether, meta-analysis of AI experts can fundamentally catalyze neuroscientific discovery by overcoming the barrier of data aggregation from heterogeneous studies, finally bringing together a scattered literature to identify emergent patterns and latent insights across disparate subfields, modalities, and species.",

      "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
      "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

      "title": "Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)",
      "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.",

      "title": "Neonatal morphine and HIV synergy induce persistent neuroimmune and anxiety-related transcriptional states",
      "content": "Background: Early life opioid exposure can disrupt neurodevelopment and heighten vulnerability to anxiety and affective disorders, particularly in individuals with HIV. Methods: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled adolescent brains from wild-type and HIV1 transgenic (Tg26) mice exposed to morphine during postnatal days 2 to 7. Results: Morphine exposure in Tg26 mice resulted in a highly dysregulated microglial phenotype, characterized by the ectopic upregulation of genes encoding neuronpeptides (Avp, Hcrt, and Pmch), while simultaneously showing a reduction in both inflammatory and homeostatic markers (Map3k6, Lgals3, Ccl3). Microglia also showed enhanced expression of dynorphin (Pdyn) and {kappa}-opioid receptor (Oprk1) signaling modules implicated in dysphoria and stress-induced negative effects. Furthermore, transcriptomic mapping revealed cell-type-specific neuronal adaptations: cholinergic neurons upregulated genes linked to anxiety and arousal (Avp, Oxt), GABAergic neurons upregulated genes linked to condition and aversive behavior, whereas glutamatergic neurons enriched for transcripts associated with thigmotaxis and fear behaviors. Conclusions: Together, these findings demonstrate that brief neonatal morphine exposure in an HIV-inflamed milieu induces persistent, cell-type-specific neuroimmune and neurotransmitter reprogramming that engages the dynorphin KOR pathway and predisposes to anxiety- and aversion-related behaviors.",

      "title": "Dual-targeting snRNA gene therapy rescues STMN2 and UNC13A splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective deterioration of motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). A key driver of this pathogenesis is nuclear loss of ALS-associated protein TDP-43, leading to mis-splicing of TDP-43 targets including important neuronal genes STMN2 and UNC13A. Here, we have developed a gene therapy strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies, to correct mis-splicing of both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons using small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) encoded from a single vector. We identified promoter sequence elements to increase therapeutic snRNA expression by 10-fold, then further optimized the expression cassette with combinatorial snRNA targeting to rescue multiple cryptic splicing targets. The engineered snRNAs restored normal pre-mRNA processing of both STMN2 and UNC13A transcripts despite TDP-43 loss of function, rescuing stathmin-2 protein levels in iPSC derived motor neurons, restoring their axonal regeneration capacity to wild-type levels. In addition, adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of the snRNAs to the murine central nervous system in the constitutive cryptic splicing model Stmn2Hum{Delta}GU fully restored cortical Stmn2 pre-mRNA processing, highlighting the utility of snRNAs as a therapeutic modality in vivo. Together, this study demonstrates that snRNAs are a promising and versatile therapeutic strategy for the simultaneous correction of multiple aberrant transcripts affected by cryptic splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies.",
