      "title": "Emerging technologies and neuroscience-based approaches in dyslexia: a narrative review toward integrative and personalized solutions",
      "content": "BackgroundDevelopmental dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs reading ability despite adequate intelligence and education, affecting up to 17% of children worldwide. Advances in neuroscience have revealed complex mechanisms involving phonological, visual, and temporal processing, with cross-linguistic variability. At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",

      "title": "Loss of Nocturnin increases neuronal viability in oxidative stress conditions",
      "content": "Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and is strongly associated with neuronal cell death. Nocturnin was identified as a NADP(H) phosphatase and key regulator of oxidative stress. NADPH serves as a crucial co-factor for enzymes which regenerate antioxidants, and downregulation of its levels increases sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined how the loss of Nocturnin impacts redox homeostasis and neuronal survival in Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression PD mouse model (DASYN53). Here we demonstrate that loss of Nocturnin increases CAD cell viability by increasing total glutathione levels, boosting metabolites involved in antioxidant defense, and reducing oxidative damage. Additionally, Nocturnin deletion in DASYN53 mice promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival. These findings suggest that the loss of Nocturnin protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant defense, which rescues neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.14233v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Drivers' perception of risky situations has always been a challenge in driving. Existing risk-detection methods excel at identifying collisions but face challenges in assessing the behavior of road users in non-collision situations. This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users. These risks are dynamically indicated on an adaptive heads-up display interface to enhance drivers' attention. A user study with 41 drivers confirms that Visionary Co-Driver improves drivers' risk perception and supports their recognition of roadside risks.",

      "title": "Algorithmic Management and the Future of Human Work: Implications for Autonomy, Collaboration, and Innovation",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14231v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the evolving impact of algorithmic management on human resource management (HRM) practices, with a focus on employee autonomy, procedural transparency, and the sociotechnical dynamics of performance evaluation. Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.",

      "title": "A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.",

While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in \"Thanatechnology,\" current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a \"tool for dying,\" but as a \"partner for living fully until the end\".",

      "title": "Gamified Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Mysophobia: Evaluating the Efficacy of a Simulated Sneeze Intervention",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14118v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.14013v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.",

      "title": "Affective Color Scales for Colormap Data Visualizations",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.",

      "title": "Personality Pairing Improves Human-AI Collaboration",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.13979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Here we ask how AI agent \"personalities\" interact with human personalities, and other traits, to shape human-AI collaboration, productivity and performance. To estimate these relationships, we conducted a large-scale preregistered randomized experiment that paired 1,258 participants with AI agents that were prompted to exhibit varying levels of the Big Five personality traits. These human-AI teams produced 7,266 display ads for a real think tank, and the quality of these ads was evaluated by 1,995 independent human raters as well as in a field experiment conducted on X, which generated nearly 5 million impressions. We found, first, that personality pairing impacted teamwork quality. For example, neurotic AI improved teamwork for agreeable humans but impaired it for conscientious humans. Second, we found productivity effects of personality pairing and a \"productivity-performance trade-off\" in which certain pairings (e.g., agreeable human with neurotic AI) produced fewer ads but of higher quality. Third, personality pairing influenced ad quality and performance. For example, quality improved when open humans were paired with conscientious AI and when conscientious humans were paired with disagreeable AI. Some of these pairing effects were \"jagged\" in that they varied across text and visual tasks. For example open humans produced higher quality images but lower quality text when paired with agreeable AI. Pairing effects were also present in other human traits, like country of origin. For example, extroverted AI improved quality for Latin American workers, but degraded quality for East Asian workers. These findings demonstrate that human-AI personality alignment significantly improves collaboration, productivity, and performance and lay a foundation for future research on improving human-AI collaboration through AI personalization.",
