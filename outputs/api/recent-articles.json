      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

Hoping to share the <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">release of Pact Python v3</a> that has been a long time coming \ud83d\ude05</p> <hr /> <p>It's been a couple of months since we released Pact Python v3, and after ironing out a couple of early issues, I think it's finally time to reflect on this milestone and its implications. This post is a look back at the journey, some of the challenges, the people, and the future of this project within the Pact ecosystem.</p> <p>Pact is an approach to contract testing that sits neatly between traditional unit tests (which check individual components) and end-to-end tests (which exercise the whole system). With Pact, you can verify that your services communicate correctly, without needing to spin up every dependency. By capturing the expected interactions between consumer and provider, Pact allows you to test each side in isolation and replay those interactions, giving you fast, reliable feedback and confidence that your APIs and microservices will work together in the real world. Pact Python brings this powerful workflow to the Python ecosystem, making it easy to test everything from REST APIs to event-driven systems.</p> <hr /> <p>You can read the rest of the announcement <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">here</a> and check out <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/\">Pact Python</a>.</p> <p>If you have any questions, let me know \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JP-Ellis\"> /u/JP-Ellis </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[comments]</a></span>",
