      "title": "NDNF+ interneurons have a privileged role in regulating cortical excitability",
      "content": "Cortical processing depends critically on the precise modulation of excitatory activity by a diverse population of GABAergic interneurons. Among these, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor-expressing (NDNF+) interneurons have been proposed to be \"master regulators\" of cortical microcircuits. While their role in coordinating physiological cortical activity is beginning to be understood, their contribution to restraining hyperexcitability during epileptiform activity remains unexplored. To address this, we employed calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in an NDNF-Cre mouse line to investigate how NDNF+ interneurons influence cortical hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures. Our results demonstrate that NDNF+ interneurons are actively recruited during interictal spikes and focal seizures, although more slowly than parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Optogenetic hyperpolarization of NDNF+ interneurons exacerbates epileptic discharges, whereas their depolarization suppresses focal seizures, even when the optogenetic stimulus is delayed by several seconds from seizure onset. This effect is largely mediated by GABAB receptor signalling. Additionally, chemogenetic depolarization of NDNF+ interneurons has robust antiepileptic effects both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish NDNF+ neurons as key regulators of cortical excitability and identify them as promising cellular targets for the development of anti-epileptic therapies.",

      "content": "ObjectivesThe \u201cMOC strategy\u201d is a binaural audio processing method for cochlear implants (CI) inspired by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. Although the strategy can improve hearing for CI users, it requires a bilateral channel pairing for the contralateral control of the backend compression and, therefore, the same number of frequency channels and electrodes on both sides. This may limit its clinical applicability. As a step to overcome this difficulty, here, we present and test a version of the MOC strategy designed to operate at the front end (FE) rather than the back end of processing, referred to as the MOCFE.DesignThe MOCFE strategy was implemented and tested in combination with a pair of functionally independent bilateral MED-EL FS4 audio processors. The hearing of bilateral CI users was compared for the MOCFE as well as for two reference strategies: the standard FS4 strategy and a backend MOC strategy. The MOCFE and MOC strategies were implemented with fast contralateral inhibition. Measures included (1) speech reception thresholds for sentences in fluctuating and stationary noise, in unilateral and bilateral listening modes, and for three different speech levels; and (2) sound source localization in quiet and in noise. Five bilateral users of MED-EL CIs participated in the evaluations.Results(1) For speech intelligibility in fluctuating noise, the MOCFE was as beneficial (re FS4) as the backend MOC strategy, except for one specific spatial configuration (S\u221260N60), where the MOCFE produced no benefits while the MOC strategy did. (2) Neither the MOCFE nor the MOC strategies improved intelligibility in a stationary noise, possibly because they involved fast rather than slow contralateral inhibition. (3) The binaural MOCFE and MOC strategies tended to improve sound source localization slightly relative to the FS4 strategy.ConclusionThe MOCFE can become a successful alternative to the MOC strategy, as it may be more easily implemented in clinical devices and applied to a broader range of clinical map configurations.",

      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",
