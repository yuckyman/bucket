      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
      "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

It automatically detects tests (including async tests) and displays them in a tree view by app, file, class, and method. You get one-click run/debug, instant search, test profiles, and CodeLens shortcuts directly next to test code. </p> <p>Target Audience</p> <p>This project is intended for developers working on Django applications who want a smoother, more integrated test workflow inside VS Code. It\u2019s suitable for real projects and professional use (not just a toy demo), especially when you\u2019re running large test suites and want faster navigation, debugging, and test re-runs. </p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>Compared to terminal-based testing workflows:</p> <p>You get a visual test tree with smart discovery instead of manually scanning test output. </p> <p>Compared to generic Python test extensions:</p> <p>It\u2019s Django-specific, tailored to Django\u2019s test layout and manage.py integration rather than forcing a generic test runner. </p> <p>Links</p> <p>GitHub (open source): <a href=\"https://github.com/viseshagarwal/django-test-manager\">https://github.com/viseshagarwal/django-test-manager</a></p> <p>VS Code Marketplace: <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ViseshAgarwal.django-test-manager\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ViseshAgarwal.django-test-manager</a></p> <p>Open VSX: <a href=\"https://open-vsx.org/extension/viseshagarwal/django-test-manager\">https://open-vsx.org/extension/viseshagarwal/django-test-manager</a></p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate feedback from the Python community \u2014 and of course feature suggestions or contributions are welcome \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/visesh-agarwal\"> /u/visesh-agarwal </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prj82s/django_test_manager_a_vs_code_extension_that/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prj82s/django_test_manager_a_vs_code_extension_that/\">[comments]</a></span>",
