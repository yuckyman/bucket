      "title": "Toward Understanding the Role of Visual Hierarchy in Flicker-induced Time Dilation: A Preregistered Study",
      "content": "When a temporal interval is marked by flickering stimuli, its subjective duration is overestimated. The cortical origin of this temporal illusion, termed flicker-induced time dilation (FITD), is not yet well understood. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to explore whether the higher-level regions of ventral visual stream contribute to FITD. By using the semantic wavelet-induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) technique, four experimental conditions were created. Luminance and semantic flickers were created to selectively target the lower- and higher-level regions of the visual hierarchy, respectively. A combined luminance and semantic flicker condition was additionally created to probe the effect of simultaneous entrainment of lower- and higher-level visual regions on FITD. Lastly, to account for the single-pixel modulations and ripple-like motions induced by SWIFT, a control scramble condition was included. The phase-clustering analysis (N = 20) confirmed that the control scramble condition did not result in neural entrainment, whereas the flicker conditions showed entrainment whose magnitude and topography were consistent with their respective experimental manipulations. Nonetheless, the behavioral results indicated that the time dilation effect was not modulated by the flickering conditions neither was its magnitude correlated with the size of entrained oscillations. Moreover, the SWIFT scrambles led to a time dilation effect which was comparable to the flickering conditions. We discussed that while our results are not in agreement with neural entrainment account of FITD, they are not in agreement with the processing principles definition of salience either. Based on the putative shared cortical sources of SWIFT scrambles and luminance-modulated flickers, we conjectured that FITD, and motion-induced time dilation may rely on the same mechanism based on activation of motion sensitive regions. Finally, our results indicated that, at least at the presence of steadily activated lower-level visual and/or motion sensitive areas, periodic activation of ventral stream does not contribute to FITD.",

      "title": "The DNA methylation enzymatic machinery in substance use disorders: a systematic review",
      "content": "Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronic affections defined by similar symptoms across a variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or methamphetamine. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent key candidates to help explain the long-lasting effect of these drugs, as well as inter-individual variation in vulnerability. Here, we systematically reviewed current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation and the related enzymatic machinery in rodent models of SUD. Using a prospectively registered methodology, 99 articles were prioritized. A first set of studies manipulated the expression or activity of methylation or demethylation pathways. Depending on the brain region or drug considered, SUD-related behavioral and molecular manifestations were bidirectionally modulated, suggesting both pathogenic and protective roles for drug-induced methylomic plasticity. A second set of articles focused on candidate genes. Although significant heterogeneity across experimental models, brain regions or gene targets resulted in an absence of replicated findings, available data nevertheless support the notion that drugs of abuse trigger DNA methylation changes at discrete loci. Third, recent genome-wide studies have started to demonstrate that these drugs recruit widespread reprogramming. Strikingly, most adaptations occur outside promoter regions, highlighting an important challenge toward their functional interpretation. Finally, studies of drug exposure during gestation or adolescence suggest long-lasting consequences, with the potential for early intervention.",

      "content": "<p>I\u2019ve been working in fairly locked\u2011down Windows environments where I\u2019m allowed to run Python, but not install or launch new `.exe` files. In addition the built-in windows dictations are blocked (the only good one isn't local anyway). At the same time, I really wanted accurate, fast dictation without sending audio to a cloud service, and without needing a GPU. Most speech\u2011to\u2011text setups I tried either required special launchers, GPU access, or were awkward to run day\u2011to\u2011day.<p>To scratch that itch, I built Chirp, a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally, uses NVIDIA\u2019s ParakeetV3 model, and is managed end\u2011to\u2011end with `uv`. If you can run Python on your machine, you should be able to run Chirp\u2014no additional executables required.<p>Under the hood, Chirp uses the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 ONNX bundle. ParakeetV3 has accuracy in the same ballpark as Whisper\u2011large\u2011v3 (multilingual WER ~4.9 vs ~5.0 in the open ASR leaderboard), but it\u2019s much faster and happy on CPU.<p>The flow is:\n- One\u2011time setup that downloads and prepares the ONNX model:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.setup`\n- A long\u2011running CLI process:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.main`\n- A global hotkey that starts/stops recording and injects text into the active window.<p>A few details that might be interesting technically:<p>- <i>Local\u2011only STT:</i> Everything runs on your machine using ONNX Runtime; by default it uses CPU providers, with optional GPU providers if your environment allows.<p>- <i>Config\u2011driven behavior:</i> A `config.toml` file controls the global hotkey, model choice, quantization (`int8` option), language, ONNX providers, and threading. There\u2019s also a simple `[word_overrides]` map so you can fix tokens that the model consistently mishears.<p>- <i>Post\u2011processing pipeline:</i> After recognition, there\u2019s an optional \u201cstyle guide\u201d step where you can specify prompts like \u201csentence case\u201d or \u201cprepend: >>\u201d for the final text.<p>- <i>No clipboard gymnastics required on Windows:</i> The app types directly into the focused window; there are options for clipboard\u2011based pasting and cleanup behavior for platforms where that makes more sense.<p>- <i>Audio feedback:</i> Start/stop sounds (configurable) let you know when the mic is actually recording.<p>So far I\u2019ve mainly tested this on my own Windows machines with English dictation and CPU\u2011only setups. There are probably plenty of rough edges (different keyboard layouts, language settings, corporate IT policies, etc.), and I\u2019d love feedback from people who:<p>- Work in restricted corporate environments and need local dictation.\n- Have experience with Parakeet/Whisper or ONNX Runtime and see obvious ways to improve performance or robustness.\n- Want specific features (e.g., better multi\u2011language support, more advanced post\u2011processing, or integrations with their editor/IDE).<p>Repo is here:  \n`<a href=\"https://github.com/Whamp/chirp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Whamp/chirp</a>`<p>If you try it, I\u2019d be very interested in:<p>- CPU usage and latency on your hardware,\n- How well it behaves with your keyboard layout and applications,\n- Any weird failure cases or usability annoyances you run into.<p>Happy to answer questions and dig into technical details in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45930659\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45930659</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",
