      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Lemborexant Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Long-Term Functional Recovery in a Murine Model of Ischemic Stroke",
      "content": "Introduction: Recovery following ischemic stroke is highly variable and often incomplete, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel targeted poststroke treatments. While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment and progressive neuroinflammation in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice expressing the R245H Sgsh variant",
      "content": "Aims: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome) is an inherited childhood-onset dementia caused by insufficient SGSH enzymatic activity and subsequent accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. One of the most prevalent mutations is the Arg245His variant, representing up to 58% of mutations in some populations. Whilst other mouse models exist, their applicability to, and translational delivery of, clinically relevant pharmacological chaperones is limited. We therefore aimed to generate and characterise a novel SgshR245H knock-in mouse model of MPS IIIA. Methods: CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing introduced the SgshR245H mutation, and a breeding colony was established. Mouse behaviour was evaluated in a test battery; SGSH activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured using fluorometric and mass spectrometric assays, respectively; and histological staining was undertaken to characterise brain pathology. Results: Spatial memory and learning deficits were apparent in the Morris Water Maze probe and Y-maze tests. Elevated Plus Maze exploration revealed reduced anxiety-like behaviours. SgshR245H mice exhibited progressive accumulation of brain heparan sulfate and elevated levels of GFAP-reactive astroglial staining and activated microglia. Conclusion: SgshR245H MPS IIIA mice recapitulate key characteristics of the human disorder, representing a useful tool for studying disease pathogenesis and evaluating novel therapies.",

      "content": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (CLN7) is a devastating paediatric neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and limited natural history data to guide therapeutic development. Here, we present the first multimodal characterization of prodromal and early-stage CLN7 disease in Japanese macaques carrying a spontaneous CLN7-/- mutation. Using structural T2-weighted MRI for volumetry, [18F]FDG PET for glucose metabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET for neuroinflammation, we observed region-dependent patterns in volumetric, molecular, and metabolic alterations. MRI confirmed the presence of disease-associated atrophy in many cortical and subcortical brain regions, consistent with human pathology, [18F]FDG PET revealed early cortical and subcortical widespread hypometabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET imaging detected progressive neuroinflammation in the same brain areas. CSF analyses further showed age-dependent increases in neurofilament light (NfL), providing convergent evidence for neurodegeneration. Together, these results define a prodromal trajectory in CLN7 disease , establish sensitive imaging and fluid biomarkers, and validate the macaque model as a powerful platform for testing interventions.",

      "title": "Distinct Cortical and Oculomotor Dynamics During Endogenous and Exogenous Competition in Working Memory",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) enables the temporary maintenance of information for guiding thought and action, but its limited capacity requires internal selective attention mechanisms to prioritize goal-relevant representations. Like external attention, internal selection can be shaped by both endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (stimulus-driven) factors. Classic work by Charles Folk and Roger Remington demonstrated that such factors interact competitively during external attention, producing stimulus-driven capture under certain conditions. Whether similar competitive dynamics govern internal selection remains unclear. Here, we combined EEG and eye-tracking to examine how endogenous and exogenous influences interact during the selection of information held in working memory. Participants remembered two oriented bars and used either a pro-cue or an anti-cue to guide recall. Behavioral responses and lateralized alpha-band activity revealed robust delays in selecting task-relevant WM content under competition. In contrast, oculomotor biases toward memorized locations emerged with similar timing across pro- and anti-cue conditions, providing no evidence for retro-capture or delayed selection. These findings indicate that internal selection does not resolve competition via rapid capture, as in external attention, but through time-extended cortical processes. Our results highlight functional dissociations between cortical and oculomotor systems and offer new insight into how internal attention implements selection under competitive demands.",

      "content": "INTRODUCTION The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first sites of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may seed neocortical tau. METHODS We used longitudinal neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to assess LC integrity in vivo in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired older adults with familial risk of AD in relation to tau and amyloid PET and long-term cognitive trajectories. RESULTS We showed that both LC integrity at baseline and its rate of degeneration over time independently predicted a neocortical pattern of tau deposition. In keeping with the known function of the LC, neuropsychological tests showed that LC integrity at baseline predicted changes in attention. Finally, we found that longitudinal LC degeneration correlated with memory decline in people with elevated neocortical amyloid burden. DISCUSSION Our findings underscore the importance of LC in AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal measurement of LC degeneration may help distinguish trajectories of age-related cognitive decline and early AD.",

      "title": "Novel Cln8 p.R24G mouse line replicates major clinical features of Northern epilepsy",
      "content": "Rationale. Northern epilepsy belongs to a group of genetically diverse lysosomal storage diseases, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). A characteristic feature of NCL pathology is the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the central nervous system. Northern epilepsy is a late-infantile -onset disease. Patients develop normally until 5-10 years old when they first present with general tonic-clonic seizures, followed by progressive cognitive impairment and a decline in motor skills. Northern epilepsy is caused by a missense variant in CLN8, causing a p.R24G amino acid substitution. CLN8 deficiency has been studied traditionally using motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice, which carry a spontaneous frame shift variant in the murine orthologue Cln8, which is not known to exist in humans. Methods. We have generated the first Cln8 p.R24G mouse model (Cln8R24G) using CRISPR/Cas9. Phenotyping analysis of the mice was conducted using behavioral and histopathological studies focusing on the brain and retina. Results. At birth, Cln8R24G KI mice were viable and asymptomatic. As the mice aged, a progressive accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C was evident in different brain regions and retinal layers. Health monitoring revealed that mutant mice developed progressive but mild motor symptoms around 7 months of age. Spontaneous epileptic seizures, like those observed in Northern epilepsy patients, were detected and recorded. An increase in FosB staining intensity, reflecting neuronal hyperactivity, was observed in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells and correlated well with the intensity of seizure activity. Neuroinflammation was evident at 4 months and increased dramatically with age, mainly in the thalamic VPN/VPL nuclei and moderately in the cortex. Neurodegeneration was most prominent in the VPN/VPL thalamic nuclei. Conclusions. We have generated the Cln8R24G mouse model that genocopies, for the first time, the pathogenic CLN8 variant present in patients with Northern epilepsy. These mice phenocopy major clinical features of the human disease, including mild motor impairment and, unlike the mnd mice, spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We hypothesize that our mouse model will open new possibilities for developing and testing targeted treatment options for Northern epilepsy and, more broadly, for early-onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Long-lasting structural and functional maturation in transplanted human neurons reprogrammed from glial progenitor cells",
      "content": "Direct reprogramming of brain-resident glial progenitor cells (GPCs) into induced neurons (iN) shows great promise for future regenerative therapies for brain diseases. This type of cell conversion is facilitated by introducing lineage-specific transcription factors or small molecules to somatic cells, and can even be achieve in vivo, targeting resident glia cells in the brain for in vivo conversion. While this have shown promising results in animal models, a crucial step is to show the long-term survival and maturation of human reprogrammed cells in vivo. However, this remains largely unexplored partly due to the inaccessible cell source of GPC and difficulty in transplanting converted neurons. In this study, we assessed human GPCs derived iNs for their long-term structural and functional neuronal maturation after transplantation to the immunodeficient mouse brain. GPCs were transduced with established transcription factor cocktail and transplanted to the medial prefrontal cortex as three-dimensional cultures to improve survival and integration upon transplantation. Our results reveal survival of hiNs, for up to 10 months post-transplantation (MPT) and wide distribution across local and proximal functionally connected brain regions. Morphological analysis revealed a gradual neuronal maturation over time, characterized by increase in cellular complexity and expression of neuronal markers. Supporting these findings, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated progressive functional maturation up to 5 MPT with increase in sodium and potassium currents, and the ability to generate multiple evoked and spontaneous action potentials, validating a neuronal phenotype. Importantly, these changes were absent in control grafts of non-converted hGPCs that retained their glia identity. Our findings indicate that hGPCs derived iNs maintain a stable neuronal phenotype that persist in the mouse brain for extended periods. These cells exhibit survival and remarkable adaptability to the host environment, enabling both structural and functional maturation over time. These results highlight their potential as a promising strategy for neural replacement therapies aimed at restoring damaged circuits and promoting brain repair.",

      "title": "FDTest: Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a Test for Memory Effects in Brain Dynamics",
      "content": "A central challenge in neuroscience is to understand how the brain flexibly balances local and distributed information processing to support diverse cognitive and conscious states. We hypothesize that a key signature of this balance is the presence of memory effects, which arise when a brain region's future activity depends not only on its current state, but also on past information fed back from the wider network. Here we introduce the FDTest, a method for assessing local memory effects in multidimensional systems by measuring violations of a generalized Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We first apply this framework to whole-brain models fitted to human neuroimaging data, showing that the brain's memory structure reflects its underlying connectivity. We then extend the analysis to individualized models of subjects during wakefulness and deep sleep. Memory effects are consistently stronger in wakefulness, indicating richer inter-regional dependencies and more integrated dynamics. These findings establish local memory as a dynamical marker of brain state and position the FDTest as a principled tool for probing the hidden structure of neural dynamics in both models and experiments.",

      "content": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid constituent of the cannabis plant that shows promise for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region in the etiologies of these disorders and is actively modulated by CBD. Prior research has established that CBD alters the molecular composition of the NAc, but none have assessed how CBD affects NAc neuronal function. In this study, we demonstrate that CBD significantly decreases D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron membrane excitability, broadens action potentials, and has no effect on spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc core. These data enhance our understanding of CBDs physiological effects and provide mechanistic insight into its therapeutic potential.",
