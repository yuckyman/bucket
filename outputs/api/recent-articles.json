      "title": "Show HN: Jottings; Anti-social microblog for your thoughts",
      "content": "<p>I built Jottings because I was tired of my own thoughts getting trapped inside algorithmic feeds where I had to perform. There was a huge mental load before posting something on X or Instagram.<p>Every time I wanted to share something small or unfinished, I opened Twitter and lost 20 minutes to the timeline. Writing a blog post felt too heavy for those smaller, quick thoughts. I just wanted a place to write something down quickly and hit publish.<p>Jottings is that place. It gives you a clean microblog on a domain you own. Posts show up in simple chronological order. No likes. No followers. No feed trying to decide what matters.<p>What Jottings is\n- A microblogging platform that builds fully static microblog sites\n- A free subdomain (you.jottings.me) or connect your own domain on PRO plans\n- Markdown, tags, RSS feed, links with preview, and image uploads\n- An optional AI writing helper when you are stuck or lazy to fix grammar\n- Optimized for SEO and AI search friendly\n- Analytics for your sites<p>What it is not\n- Not a social network\n- Not an engagement funnel\n- Not trying to keep you on the site\n- Not a replacement for long-form blogging, though you can use it that way<p>How it works\nEach Jot publish triggers a static site rebuild. The site is stored in Cloudflare R2 and served directly at the edge. Custom domains go through Cloudflare SSL for SaaS.\nI built it to be boring, reliable (barring Cloudflare's latest issues), and cheap to run.<p>Pricing\nFree tier for a subdomain, text posts, and a lot more.\nUSD5 per month for custom domains, images, full Markdown, and the writing helper.\nI priced it to be an easy yes.<p>Limitations\n- No comments (on purpose)\n- No native apps yet (iOS is coming)\n- The writing helper is helpful but not magic\n- I am a solo founder, so features move at human speed<p>I use Jottings regularly to document what I build. It has been the lowest-friction way I have found to publish anything publicly.<p>Demo of Jottings site for product updates: <a href=\"https://jottings.jottings.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.jottings.me/</a>\nDemo of my personal Jottings site: <a href=\"https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com</a> (with custom subdomain)<p>I would love feedback from this community.

      "content": "IntroductionThe relationship between glaucoma and neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex has yet to be fully explored and understood. This study employs the time-domain (TD) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to noninvasively monitor the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in the visual cortex.Methods203 eyes (104 subjects, 46 females, 58 males): 44 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 38 with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 54 with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 67 without abnormal/pathologic condition, were analyzed. All subjects had a complete eye examination, including Goldmann tonometry, computerized visual field optical coherence tomography, pattern electroretinogram, and visual evoked potentials. Visual cortex HRF was assessed by TD-fNIRS using a standard stimulation protocol (reversed checkerboard at 10\u202fHz). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to obtain groups (clusters) of eyes based on the respective TD-fNIRS parameters. The relationships between the clusters and the diagnostic groups were assessed by comparing the distributions of the former ones among healthy, hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes.ResultsWe found six clusters of eyes, five representing eyes with consistent measurements of HRF amplitudes across acquisition channels (left/right hemisphere) and repeated stimuli, distinguished by distinct magnitudes of neurovascular coupling. The sixth cluster included all the cases of incoherent HRF patterns. Evidence of a different distribution between glaucomatous and healthy eyes was found (p\u202f=\u202f0.0009), suggesting that high levels of neurovascular coupling are less likely to be observed in NTG and OAG groups.ConclusionOccipital TD-fNIRS could be fruitfully implemented in a clinical setting to provide significant and easy-to-get insights on neurovascular dynamics, supporting the differential diagnosis of glaucomatous patients. Our findings highlight the importance of the underappreciated correlates between glaucoma and overall neurologic status.",

      "title": "A hybrid Spiking Neural Network\u2013Transformer architecture for motor imagery and sleep apnea detection",
      "content": "IntroductionMotor imagery (MI) classification and sleep apnea (SA) detection are two critical tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) and biomedical signal analysis. Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

      "title": "Isogenic iPSC-derived CTBP1 mutant neuronal cells exhibit neurodevelopmental defects",
      "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",
