      "title": "PKU tags, novel genetically encoded shape tags for cell labeling in light and electron microscopy",
      "content": "Distinguishing among neuronal cell types is crucial for deciphering complex neural networks and brain functions. However, the current repertoire of cell-labeling tools compatible with light microscopy (LM) and/or electron microscopy (EM) is limited compared to the vast number of cell types in the brain. Here, we introduce PKU (polymer king-size unit) tags, genetically encoded shape tags that leverage the polymerization of self-assembling proteins, spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins and, optionally, a nuclear targeting sequence to generate a series of multi-shaped (spherical or filamentous), multi-colored (blue, green, red, near-infrared) and multi-localized (cytosolic or nuclear) tags. By co-expressing multiple PKU tags within the same cell, a combinatorial strategy further expands the repertoire, which can theoretically yield hundreds of unique labeling patterns. Expressing PKU tags in vivo provides multi-cell-type labeling and neuronal circuit tracing, without altering the animal's behavior or transcriptomic profiles. Moreover, when fused to the peroxidase APEX2, PKU tags maintain their shape-specific features, providing shape barcoding using EM. Thus, PKU tags represent a versatile and efficient toolkit for studying connectomics using both LM and EM.",

      "content": "Motor control depends on flexible modulation of beta-band oscillations (15-30 Hz) within cortical-basal ganglia circuits. In Parkinson's disease (PD), beta synchronization becomes pathologically elevated, contributing to motor slowing and rigidity and motivating the need for non-invasive strategies that can suppress excessive beta activity. Transcranial alternating stimulation (tACS) provides a non-invasive approach to modify endogenous oscillatory activity, yet conventional open-loop tACS typically reinforces, rather than disrupts, endogenous synchrony. Here, we developed an online adaptive EEG-guided closed-loop system that continuously tracked the instantaneous beta phase and delivered stimulation either aligned (in-phase) or 180 degrees opposed (anti-phase) to the ongoing beta rhythm. Thirty-eight right-handed healthy participants performed a stop-signal task while receiving 4x1 HD-tACS over pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) in three conditions: in-phase, anti-phase, and sham. Anti-phase tACS produced a robust suppression of beta relative to both in-phase and sham stimulation, consistent with destructive interference of the endogenous rhythm. Behaviorally, anti-phase tACS slowed the stopping process, whereas in-phase stimulation reduced peak force rate during go trials and decreased variability of the go response, consistent with increased inhibitory tone and stabilization of ongoing motor states. These results provide converging behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for destructive interference of anti-phase tACS and establish a mechanistic framework for phase-specific closed-loop neuromodulation, paving the way to implement a noninvasive therapeutic strategy aimed at desynchronizing pathological beta in Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "Local homeostatic scaling supports stable rate propagation under noise and heterogeneity",
      "content": "The brain maintains stable information transmission despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal properties and noise. Signals must travel across multiple regions with high fidelity without interruption or distortion. Previous studies achieve reliable firing-rate propagation in feedforward circuits only with finely tuned synaptic weights; otherwise, firing rate activity either decays or explodes. How neural circuits self-organize to achieve stable rate propagation without external fine-tuning remains unclear. Here, we introduce a simple, local homeostatic synaptic scaling rule in which each neuron rescales its excitatory inputs based on the mismatch between mean excitatory presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rate. We show both analytically and numerically that this local learning rule enables noisy feedforward networks to spontaneously organize stable rate propagation across layers when driven by external inputs, without the need for global supervision or precise weight initialization. This rule compensates for intrinsic neuronal properties by adjusting synaptic strengths to maintain consistent firing rate transmission, which allows heterogeneous feedforward networks to self-organize to support stable rate propagation. Finally, we show that when combined with homeostatic inhibitory synaptic plasticity, the rule stabilizes attractor firing rate in recurrent networks, preserving an asynchronous-irregular activity under perturbations. Our findings reveal how local plasticity rules support robust neural circuits capable of signal propagation without external fine-tuning, providing mechanistic insights into neurobiological self-organization and principles for designing resilient spiking networks.",

      "title": "The Dominant Hand-Area Network: Task-Signal Mismatch and the Decoupling of BCI Skill from Global Efficiency in Postural Motor Imagery",
      "content": "Rationale: The neurophysiological basis of motor imagery (MI) is foundational to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. While BCI decoding relies on local sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), MI itself is a large-scale network process. It is an open, and clinically critical question whether an individual's BCI decoding skill is related to global network integration. This is complicated when the instructed task (e.g., postural imagery) differs from the underlying neurophysiological signal (e.g., hand-area SMRs). This study investigates the network dynamics of this task-signal mismatch and its relation to BCI performance. Methods: We analyzed a 64-channel EEG dataset of 32 healthy participants (from the OpenNeuro dataset ds005342 cohort) performing a cued motor imagery task (e.g., \"sit-to-stand\") contrasted against an idle state. BCI decoding performance was quantified using a Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) pipeline with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. We then constructed functional brain networks from the beta (13-30 Hz) band using Phase-Locking Value (PLV) and spectral Granger Causality (GC). Graph theory was employed to analyze network topology, and we correlated individual BCI accuracy with global network efficiency in both sensor and source space. Results: BCI performance was robustly high (LDA (Mean: 82.10% {+/-} 8.80% SD)), 95% CI [78.92%, 85.28%], p < 10-20), confirming a high-fidelity local SMR signal. Strikingly, CSP analysis revealed this signal originated not from the expected leg-area (Cz), but from the hand-area sensorimotor cortex (C3/C4) (See Figure 4). Despite this local-signal fidelity, this decoding skill was critically decoupled from whole-brain network integration, showing no correlation of BCI accuracy with global efficiency, in either sensor space (r (30) = 0.189, p = 0.299) or, more critically, in source space (r (30) = -0.054, p = 0.769, 95% CI [-0.395, 0.300]). Our network analysis, centered on this C3/C4-dominant signal, revealed a novel, hypothetical M1-centric model: the motor cortex (C3/C4) acted as the primary information broadcaster (via GC), driving activity in prefrontal coordinating hubs (F3/Fz). Furthermore, the MI state was characterized by a dynamic reconfiguration, increasing the information-gating centrality of the premotor (FC1) node while suppressing the parietal (P3) node. Conclusion: BCI decoding skill reflects a local process driven by SMR signal fidelity from the dominant hand area--even during non-hand tasks--rather than a global process relying on whole-brain efficiency. We propose a hypothetical \"Broadcasting Motor Cortex\" model in which the MI network is not a simple PFC-M1 hierarchy but a dynamic, M1-centered system that re-routes information through premotor and parietal gateways. Within this framework, baseline network properties may influence skill, but task-evoked global integration does not emerge as a strong correlate of performance. Given that our study was powered only to detect large correlations (r > 0.48), the absence of such effects suggests that baseline network states (16, 17), rather than active global integration, are more likely to predict individual BCI ability.",

      "title": "Neuronal APOE4 alone is sufficient to drive tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), exacerbates tau tangles, amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation -- the pathological hallmarks of AD. While astrocytes are the primary producers of APOE in the CNS, neurons increase APOE expression under stress and aging. Prior work established that neuronal APOE4 is essential for AD pathogenesis, but whether it is sufficient to drive disease remained unknown. We generated a PS19 tauopathy mouse model selectively expressing APOE4 in neurons. Neuronal APOE4 alone proved sufficient to promote pathological tau accumulation and propagation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation to levels comparable to a tauopathy model with human APOE4 knocked-in globally. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further revealed similar transcriptomic changes in neurons and glia of both models. Together, these findings demonstrate that neuronal APOE4 alone can initiate and propagate AD pathologies, underscoring its pivotal role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Oligodendrocytes show enriched expression of amyloid precursor protein and GABA B receptor isoform 1a",
      "content": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic processing to generate amyloid-{beta}, the main component of amyloid plaques found in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The proteolytic processing of APP also generates soluble APP alpha (sAPPa) which can modulate synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth through the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR). Whether GABABR mediates functions of sAPPa; in other neural cell types such as glia remains unknown. sAPPa; binds the R1a subunit isoform of GABABR1 which contains two sushi domains absent in R1b. It is unclear whether both GABABR1 isoforms are expressed equally across brain cell types. We determined relative RNA levels of the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms in oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons in adult mice using two approaches. We developed a GABABR1 isoform-specific RNAseq analysis workflow to probe a publicly available dataset generated by Zhang et al. (2014). We also isolated five cell types from a single mouse brain and performed RT-qPCR. We show that the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms are differentially expressed among cell types. GABABR1a expression was highest in oligodendrocytes and GABABR1b expression was highest in astrocytes, suggesting that sAPPa-mediated GABABR signaling may be most prominent in oligodendrocytes. We also confirmed that APP is expressed in all five cell types and showed that APP RNA levels are highest in oligodendrocytes. Together, our findings uncover cell type-specific expression of GABABR isoforms and highlight oligodendrocytes as a principal cell type for GABABR1a-mediated APP signaling, providing a foundation for future mechanistic studies.",

      "title": "Dual Activation of MC3R and MC4R Drives Weight Loss and Reduces Food Intake in Obese Primates",
      "content": "The melanocortin system plays a central role in regulating hunger and satiety, making it an attractive target for treating metabolic disease. However, the limited clinical success of selective melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists prompted the investigation of whether concurrent melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and MC4R activation is key to unlocking the melanocortin system for the treatment of general obesity. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized novel peptides to probe the distinct and combined roles of MC3R and MC4R in nonhuman primates (NHPs). We show that selectively agonizing MC3R modulates food intake in a state-dependent manner. Moreover, co-agonism of MC3R and MC4R results in more substantial metabolic effects than selective MC4R agonism, highlighting both a non-redundant and a cooperative role of MC3R. To leverage these discoveries, we developed 710GO, an orally-available MC3R/MC4R dual agonist peptide that induces significant weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) NHPs. Oral 710GO treatment demonstrates limited weight rebound, has additive effects in combination with GLP-1s, and exhibits a clean safety profile. These results reestablish the melanocortin system, specifically concerted MC3R/MC4R agonism, as a viable mechanism for next-generation obesity therapeutics.",
