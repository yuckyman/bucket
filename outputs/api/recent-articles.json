      "title": "The Paradox of Unpredictability: Trying to Be Unpredictable Makes Sequences More Predictable",
      "content": "Human intuition about randomness is systematically biased. When asked to generate random sequences, people systematically generate too many alternations. At the same time, game-theoretic analyses of competitive interactions prescribe truly random mixed strategies as the unique way to remain unpredictable to an opponent. Despite this formal equivalence between randomness and unpredictability, research on cognitive biases in sequential judgment and on strategic behavior in games has largely proceeded in parallel, leaving open how biased internal models of randomness shape behavior when the explicit goal is to be unpredictable. Here we bring these traditions together in two experiments in which one group of participants generates sequences and another predicts them. In our first experiment, we show that when the goal shifts from being random to being unpredictable, participants reverse this pattern, generating sequences with a strong repetition bias. In a second experiment, we asked new participants to predict two model-derived sequences that were empirically calibrated to the group-level statistics from the first experiment (Competitive-like vs Random-like). We found a paradox: the repetitive sequences intended to be unpredictable were in fact more predictable than the alternating sequences intended to be random. This paradox appears to stem from an asymmetric reinforcement learning mechanism, whereby success selectively strengthens beliefs in repetition but not alternation. Our findings bridge classic cognitive bias and strategic behavior, suggesting how a fundamental learning mechanism can shape paradoxical predictability.",

      "title": "Pericyte and Endothelial Primary Cilia and Centrioles have Disparate Organization Across the Brain Microvasculature",
      "content": "The brain microvascular functions are strongly influenced by the local microenvironment and cellular organization. Intracellular organelles, including primary cilia and centrioles, play critical roles in sensing and transmitting environmental cues and maintaining vascular integrity. However, their distribution across the brain vasculature remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized publicly available large-volume electron microscopy datasets encompassing the cerebral vasculature from pial arterioles through parenchymal capillaries to pial venules. We systematically analyzed the cellular organization and characterized the distribution of primary cilia and centrioles in the mouse and human brain microvasculature. We found primary cilia exclusively on human cortical endothelial cells (ECs), indicating inter-species differences between mouse and human. Primary cilia were frequently present on mural cells (MCs, smooth muscle cells or pericytes) surrounding venules and capillaries but rarely observed on arterioles in both mouse and human brains. These MC primary cilia exhibited heterogeneity in ciliogenesis, including cells with ciliary pockets, surface cilia, and a hybrid configuration we refer as a partial pocket. In the mouse brain, many MC primary cilia were closely ensheathed by astrocytic endfeet and occasionally extended between them to establish proximity to synapses, whereas all primary cilia in the human brain were confined within the basal lamina. Our analysis of cellular density revealed similar EC densities between arterioles and venules in mice, but not in human. EC centrioles were consistently positioned against the direction of blood flow relative to the nuclei, suggesting that they may serve as a structural marker for flow direction. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of primary cilia and centrioles, highlighting distinct interspecies differences between mouse and human brain microvasculature. The proximity to neural cells and gradient distribution of these subcellular structures suggest that they may act as antennae for sensing mechanical and chemical signals within the brain microvascular environment.",

      "content": "Intracellular tau accumulation contributes to neurodegeneration and systemic dysfunction. Although tau primarily aggregates in neurons as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it also affects other cell types through poorly understood mechanisms. To define the molecular characteristics of tangle-bearing neurons and their influence on surrounding cells, we used CosMx SMI to evaluate the expression of 950 genes in more than 265,000 cells from rTg(tauP301L)4510 tauopathy and control mouse brains. In the cerebral cortex, tau pathology disrupted the excitatory-inhibitory neuron balance and altered pathways critical for myelination, similar myelin changes were observed in postmortem brain tissue from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. In the hypothalamus, tau accumulation was associated with transcriptional changes linked to pathways involved in body weight and metabolic regulation. These findings reveal molecular mechanisms underlying both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of tauopathy and identify targets for further investigation into tau pathogenesis and its systemic impact.",
