      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Parallelized Brightfield and Fluorescence Imaging of Organoids Using a Scalable Multi-Camera Platform",
      "content": "Organoid viability, maturation, and growth is commonly assayed through brightfield and fluorescence microscopy using a single objective lens. However, standard microscopic imaging systems pose significant limitations for high-throughput applications, particularly in large-scale experiments where simultaneous imaging of multiple organoids requires increased throughput. There is a strong need for systems that can capture organoid growth rapidly and consistently while minimizing disturbances to culture conditions. Here, we present a novel multi-camera array scanner (MCAS) that parallelizes imaging through the simultaneous use of 48 objective lenses and sensors, resulting in a 95% reduction in acquisition times compared to commercial high-content imagers. We demonstrate and validate this system in multiple well plate formats, in both 2D and 3D neural cell cultures, and in brightfield and fluorescence. The MCAS improves efficiency for measuring organoid growth rates, assessing responses to morphogens and drugs, and measuring viral transduction efficiency. Together, these findings establish the MCAS as a scalable and versatile imaging platform for rapid phenotyping in organoid research.",

      "content": "<p>Registering for my 35th consecutive Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in early July 2025, I realized the Conference is the longest standing yearly ritual of my life. I couldn't help wondering, why do I keep doing it? Is it duty or desire, an act of fidelity or of faith? And is it worth it?</p>",

      "title": "The Somatostatin Pathway Projected from the Basal Forebrain to the Lateral Habenula Promotes Isoflurane Anesthesia Recovery",
      "content": "<p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <i></i> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>",
