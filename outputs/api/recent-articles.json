      "content": "ObjectivesBy employing deep learning-based automatic whole-brain region segmentation technology, we aim to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional brain volumes and disease duration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).MethodsA retrospective study design was implemented on 83 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had complete clinical and imaging data. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRI) were imported into the uAI platform for automated regional segmentation of brain tissue. Volumetric data from five major brain regions and 80 subregions were extracted to explore their potential associations with disease progression in PD patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression model within the framework of linear regression analysis, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.ResultsCross-sectional analysis revealed that in PD patients, volume ratios of multiple brain regions\u2014including the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobules, bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, and right globus pallidus\u2014were negatively associated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, the right hippocampus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus showed positive correlations (p < 0.05). The combined volume ratios of these brain regions also decreased with longer disease duration (p < 0.05). Furthermore, absolute volume differences in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and cerebellar white matter increased as the disease progressed (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn PD patients, volume ratios and absolute volume differences in specific brain subregions associated with lateralized intracranial changes may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing brain tissue alterations during disease progression.",

      "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

      "title": "Whole-Brain Millisecond-Scale Effective Connectivity Atlas of Auditory and Visual Naming",
      "content": "Neurobiological models suggest that speech relies on interactions among distant cortical regions interconnected by white matter pathways. Prior studies have shown that speech-related functional coactivation--simultaneous high-gamma augmentation across distributed regions--reflects underlying neural interactions, as validated by electrical stimulation mapping. However, it remains unclear at the whole-brain level when, for how long, and in which directions cortical regions transmit information, and how dynamic information flows contribute to speech. Here, we investigated the causal roles of directional neural information flow during auditory and visual naming using intracranial EEG from 9,526 artifact-free nonepileptic sites across 127 patients. Information flow, estimated by transfer entropy-based effective connectivity, was classified as excitatory when high-gamma acceleration in one region predicted subsequent acceleration in another, and inhibitory when deceleration predicted downstream deceleration. Following stimulus onset, excitatory flows emerged from modality-specific sensory cortices and propagated to higher-order regions, later becoming bidirectional as functional coactivation developed. Each excitatory flow event was transient (<500 ms), typically followed by inhibitory flows and decreased coactivation, during which excitatory flows often emerged along new pathways. During auditory naming, faster response times were associated with stronger excitatory flows in left perisylvian regions; during visual naming, faster responses were linked to stronger flows in bilateral basal temporal cortices. Stronger excitatory flows at specific time points predicted a higher probability of stimulation-induced symptoms (Spearman's rho: 0.54 - 0.81; p<0.00001), whereas associations with inhibitory flows peaked later. Excitatory flows near visual naming response onset were particularly associated with stimulation-induced speech arrest and face sensorimotor symptoms, whereas functional coactivation alone failed to reveal comparable associations. These findings demonstrate that transient acceleration of directional neural interactions through white matter supports successive stages of speech processing. As activity within one pathway decelerates, excitatory flow accelerates along another, enabling functional transitions critical for naming. By establishing the causal contribution of temporally precise, anatomically specific white matter pathways, this study substantiates and extends existing neurobiological models of speech. To facilitate replication and dynamic whole-brain visualization, we provide open access to the full dataset (62.15 GB) and analysis code.",

      "title": "Neural mechanisms of handedness for precision drawing: hand-dependent engagement of cortical networks for bimanual control and tool use",
      "content": "The neural mechanisms of handedness remain poorly understood, particularly for lateralized movements such as precision drawing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how healthy adults and individuals with peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in their dominant hand performed a visually guided drawing task with each hand. We hypothesized that the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) supports drawing with either hand, and that individuals with PNI would recruit the same mechanisms as healthy adults. Methods: 33 Right-handed adults (23 healthy adults, 10 patients) underwent fMRI while performing a precision drawing task, alternating between the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). LH>RH effects were examined across 20 regions of interest (12 a priori, 8 post hoc) using two approaches: (1) BOLD magnitude, and (2) functional connectivity (FC) modulation, assessed via generalized psychophysiological interaction. Results: All effects describe LH drawing > RH drawing. Right primary motor cortex (M1) had lower magnitude and greater FC with two networks, both of which exhibited equal-or-greater magnitude: a left hemisphere M1-dorsal premotor circuit, and an intrahemispheric parieto-temporal circuit. Right M1 (also had reduced interhemispheric FC with inferior parietal lobule, which exhibited lower magnitude. Patient group had no effect on magnitude or FC. Conclusions: Three neural mechanisms differentiate LH from RH drawing in right handed adults. First, a left hemisphere system for bimanual control, which engages intrahemispherically (directly) during RH drawing but interhemispherically (indirectly) during LH drawing. Second, LH drawing increases engagement of a contralateral system that may reflect increased task demands. Third, RH drawing increases engagement of an interhemispheric circuit for tool use. The first and third systems may explain performance asymmetries associated with handedness. Patients with PNI use the same mechanisms as healthy adults, highlighting these mechanisms' potential as a neuromodulatory target to enhance LH performance after RH impairment.",

      "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

      "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
      "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

      "content": "The present study examines the neural mechanisms of value-based multiattribute decision making through the lens of choice overload during consumer choice. Two behavioral experiments established that choice sets of a moderate size with nine options were perceived as most optimal compared to choice sets with three and 24 options, and options chosen from the largest set size were judged to be the least satisfying. A functional MRI study then examined how the brain responds to choice sets varying in size and complexity by manipulating the number of options presented as well as the presence of asymmetrically dominated decoy alternatives during a simulated online shopping task. Results showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity followed an inverse U-shape as a function of choice set size, peaking for moderately sized choice sets. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) exhibited a linear trend with choice set size. Trials containing decoy options elicited greater activation of the anterior insula (AIns) and DLPFC. Computational modeling of choice behavior revealed a greater tendency to utilize a simplifying lexicographic decision strategy as decision difficulty increased, and individual differences in decision strategies were reflected in activity of the ACC and AIns. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates effort, control, and strategy during complex value-based decisions.",

      "title": "CUSP: Complex Spike Sorting from Multi-electrode Array Recordings with U-net Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction",
      "content": "Background: Complex spikes (CSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells convey unique signals complementary to Simple spike (SS) action potentials, but are infrequent and variable in waveform. Their variability and low spike counts, combined with recording artifacts such as electrode drift, make automated detection challenging. New Method: We introduce CUSP (CS sorting via U-net Sequence Prediction), a fully automated deep learning framework for CS sorting in high-density multi-electrode array recordings. CUSP uses a U-Net architecture with hybrid self-attention inception blocks to integrate local field potential and action potential signals and outputs CS event probabilities in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Detected events are clustered and paired with concurrently detected SSs to reconstruct the complete Purkinje cell activity. Results: Trained on cerebellar neuropixels recordings in rhesus macaques, CUSP achieves human-expert performance (F1 = 0.83 +/- 0.03) and even captures valid CS events overlooked during manual annotation. Comparison with Existing Methods: CUSP outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art CS and SS sorting algorithms on CS detection. It remains robust to waveform variability, spikelet composition, and electrode drift, enabling accurate CS tracking in long-term recordings. In contrast, existing methods often show false-positive biases or degrade under drift. Conclusions: CUSP provides a scalable, robust framework for analyzing burst-like or dynamically complex spike patterns. Its generalizability makes it valuable for large-scale cerebellar datasets and other neural systems, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells, where complex bursts are critical for computation. By combining expert-level accuracy with automation, CUSP offers a broadly applicable solution for studying information coding across circuits.",

      "title": "A dopamine circuit regulates locomotor initiation and persistence in Drosophila",
      "content": "Decisions to initiate or terminate locomotion reflect the commitment of an animal to expend energy and thus must be appropriately regulated. Dopaminergic system has been implicated in locomotor regulation but how it controls these decisions remains unclear. Here we show that a dopamine circuit in Drosophila mushroom body regulates cue-induced locomotor initiation and termination by integrating locomotor history and current motivation. This circuit consists of the locomotor-initiator mushroom body output neurons, MBON09, and the locomotor-terminator MBON21. Previous locomotor initiation by default suppresses the propensity of future initiation through depression of MBON09 activity by locomotion-sensitive dopamine afferents, preventing redundant action. Locomotor persistence is promoted through combined inhibition of MBON21 by MBON09 and by distinct dopamine afferents that receive fluctuating motivational signals. Persistent locomotion under high motivational state, in turn, causes dopamine-dependent MBON09 facilitation, reinvigorating locomotor initiation program. Our results revealed a dopaminergic mechanism to transform recent behavior and current motivation into a moment-by-moment internal state that in turn regulates locomotor decisions.",

      "title": "Separable neurocomputational mechanisms underlying multisensory learning",
      "content": "Efficient control of behavior requires multisensory learning from information distributed across senses. However, most neurocomputational studies have focused on unisensory signals. Here, we identify distinct but interacting neurocomputational mechanisms that support learning of multisensory associations. We designed a task in which behaviorally relevant information was available only from combinations of visual cues with either auditory or tactile cues. In 58 participants undergoing fMRI, we dissociated three processes: multisensory statistical learning (SL), modeled as stimulus-locked Shannon surprise; reinforcement learning (RL), modeled as feedback-locked signed reward prediction errors (RPEs); and feedback-locked unsigned RPEs (uRPEs), reflecting surprise about reward outcomes. Behaviorally, response times scaled with Shannon surprise (SL) while accuracy improved with feedback (RL). Model-based fMRI revealed dissociable but complementary networks: RPEs engaged ventral striatum, vmPFC, and left angular gyrus; surprise recruited bilateral angular gyrus, dlPFC, and precuneus; and uRPEs involved insula, dorsomedial prefrontal, and lateral frontoparietal cortices. Several of these regions are not typically implicated in unisensory studies, suggesting specialization for multisensory learning. All three networks were modality-general, i.e., they showed comparable strength for audiovisual and visuotactile learning. Notably, left angular gyrus tracked both Shannon surprise and RPE, identifying it as a potential hub for integrating structural and value information. These findings reveal that the brain engages distinct but complementary systems for structure-based, reward-based, and outcome-surprise computations. By combining behavioral modeling and fMRI with a novel task design, we provide a principled framework for dissecting the neurocomputational architecture of multisensory learning.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in B2 SINE RNA Expression and its Role in Hippocampal Development",
      "content": "Once dismissed as \"junk\", transposable elements (TE) have recently gained recognition for their regulatory roles, notably in the brain and in development. The brain is hormone-responsive and the hippocampus in particular is sensitive to circulating gonadal hormones. While transcriptionally active, TE function remains poorly understood, especially in the brain. We and others have shown that one particular TE RNA, B2 SINE ncRNA, is a regulator in the rodent hippocampus, especially after a psychologically stressful event like acute restraint stress. It is unknown, however, if B2 SINE ncRNA is necessary for the proper development of hippocampal neurons, and furthermore, if there is a sex difference in this development. This work investigates the difference in expression of B2 SINE RNA across sexes and its role in the development of primary hippocampal neurons. We utilized pooled locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs to knock down the expression of B2 SINE RNA and treated primary hippocampal neurons with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test if there is a difference in dendritic complexity. We used Sholl analysis to quantify the branching, number of tips, and Sholl mean. We found a sex difference in both B2 SINE, higher in males compared to females, and B-actin, lower in males compared to females. Additionally, knocking down B2 SINE RNA results in a reduction of dendritic complexity in male but not in female neurons. Taken together, this work suggests that B2 SINE RNA is expressed differentially and plays an important role in the proper development of hippocampal neurons in a sex dependent manner. Our findings support the identification of a sex-specific biomarker that may enable individualized treatment of conditions influenced by sex. This is the first evidence of the role a transposable element's RNA has in the regulation of the development of neurons and the first to show that differential regulation by sex.",

      "content": "The diversity of motor units arises from differences in the contractile properties of muscle fibers and the intrinsic electrical properties of their motoneurons. In mice, however, this relationship has not been quantitatively defined, and conventional classification often relies on subjective thresholds. Here, we combined in vivo intracellular recordings with supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods to test whether motoneuron electrophysiology can predict the physiological identity of mouse motor units. Unbiased clustering identified four groups corresponding to slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), intermediate (FI), and fast fatigable (FF) types. A multinomial logistic regression model performed well, with most errors occurring between FI and FF types, which showed substantial overlap. Reducing the task to three classes improved accuracy. Feature selection revealed that four electrophysiological properties (input conductance, rheobase, AHP duration, maximal frequency) were sufficient for high predictive performance. Overall, this study provides a quantitative description of mouse motor-unit properties and a framework for incorporating motor-unit diversity into future investigations of neuromuscular physiology and disease.",

      "title": "Perceiving Instability: How Expectations Bias Sensorimotor Processing in Balance Control",
      "content": "Maintaining balance requires rapid integration of sensory input with top-down sensorimotor predictions. Predictive coding frameworks posit that mismatches between the two (prediction errors) drive perceptual inference. Although these frameworks have helped explain perception in unisensory domains (e.g., vision, touch), it remains unclear whether such mechanisms govern perception in fast-acting sensorimotor systems like human balance. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and discrete postural perturbations, we independently manipulated expectations and sensory input by priming healthy adult participants to expect either small or large perturbations, while occasionally delivering expectancy-violating perturbations (i.e., perturbations were smaller or larger than expected). Subjective perception of instability was shaped by expectation alone, regardless of actual sensory input (i.e., perturbation magnitude). Similarly, both anticipatory pre-perturbation beta-band suppression and post-perturbation sensorimotor gamma increases were sensitive to expected perturbation magnitude. In contrast, both the balance N1 (a well-established stimulus-evoked cortical potential) and the objective postural responses of instability tracked actual perturbation magnitude alone. Crucially, neither perception, nor any of these early (commonly analysed) neural or behavioural markers, encoded prediction errors. These findings suggest that two distinct systems exist: one that is sensitive to top-down expectations and another that is driven by sensory input, independent of expectation or mismatches. These findings challenge the centrality of prediction error as a driver of perception in fast sensorimotor systems such as postural control, and offer insight into conditions marked by distorted bodily awareness during balance.",
