      "title": "Novel, small molecules targeting the 5-HT4R receptor protect against stress-induced maladapative behavior with efficacy across age",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Stress is a risk factor for developing psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Compounds targeting the serotonin type 4 receptor (5-HT4R) hold promise as novel rapid-acting treatments of mood disorders. However, a lack of selectivity and numerous side effects have been limiting factors for their clinical use. Here, we developed and characterized novel-composition 5-HT4R compounds in mouse models of stress. METHODS: Three 5-HT4R-targeting compounds were designed and synthesized based on PF-04995274, a high-affinity 5-HT4R ligand reported to be a partial agonist. G-protein assays were utilized to characterize molecular activity. Saline, PF-04995274, or a novel compound were administered before or after stress in male and female mice. Drug effects were assayed using behavioral paradigms. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of drug on glutamatergic activity in hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3). RESULTS: Prophylactic administration of DL5, DL7, or DL8 was effective at reducing stress-induced maladaptive behaviors in male and female mice; DL7 and DL8 were effective when administered after stress. When administered following learned helplessness (LH), DL7 reduced behavioral despair and increased c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. All novel compounds attenuated large-amplitude AMPA receptor mediated bursts in ventral CA3 (vCA3). In aged male mice, prophylactic DL7 reduced behavioral despair. CONCLUSIONS: These results characterize novel 5-HT4R-targeting compounds for stress-induced psychiatric disease with the potential to address unmet needs in adult and aged patients with stress-induced psychiatric illness. Future work will characterize their mechanism of action with the goal of clinical development.",

      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "content": "Perturbation-evoked potentials (PEPs) have been widely used to investigate static and dynamic perturbations on postural and motor control through analysis of cortical responses. In this pilot study, we present an innovative approach using IoT-based Perturbatory Electrical Stimulation (PES) during treadmill walking to assess cortical responses in healthy adults (N = 6) and individuals with Parkinson's disease (N = 4), with a focus on the N1 component. This approach integrates PES and EEG systems through an Internet of Things (IoT) framework utilizing the MQTT protocol, enabling synchronized and wireless data acquisition during gait. The results indicated significant differences in N1 latency (p = 0.005), with the Parkinson's disease group presenting higher latencies in the N1 component (252.50 \u00b1 32.62 ms) compared to the healthy adult group (175.50 \u00b1 30.42 ms). Significant correlations were observed between N1 amplitude and participants' age (r = 0.669, p = 0.049) and between TUG performance and PES intensity (mA) (r = -0.697, p = 0.037). No significant correlations were found between N1 latency and PES intensity (mA), visible motor threshold (mA), or Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how Parkinson's disease impacts cortical responses to sensorimotor perturbations during gait, particularly regarding sensory processing and motor feedback, and highlight the potential utility of the PES system in future studies in motor control.",

      "content": "Schizencephaly is a rare congenital cerebral malformation typically diagnosed in early childhood due to serious neurological manifestations. Our case report described a patient with open lip schizencephaly, notable for three unique aspects. First, the patient experienced epileptic seizures in adulthood, which is atypical compared to the usual onset in childhood. Additionally, the patient reported migraine-like pain occurring seconds before each epileptic seizure, with a short interval and regular occurrence. Finally, contrary to the expected severity of symptoms in a patient with open lip schizencephaly, the patient was able to live independently in daily activities, maintained normal cognitive function, and effectively managed both seizures and headaches with standard medication. The purpose of this report is to highlight the significant role of schizencephaly as a causative factor in adult-onset epilepsy and to emphasize the need for a comprehensive therapeutic approach addressing both the structural and functional aspects of this complex neurodevelopmental condition (under the premise of schizencephaly, there were migraine-like attacks in the short term before epileptic seizures).",

Brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for restoring communication in individuals with partial or complete loss of the ability to speak due to paralysis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and other neurological disorders. Many of the approaches to speech decoding reported in the BCI literature have required time-aligned target representations to allow successful training\u2014a major challenge when translating such approaches to people who have already lost their voice. Approach. In this pilot study, we made a first step toward scenarios in which no ground truth is available. We utilized a graph-based clustering approach to identify temporal segments of speech production from electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals alone. We then used the estimated speech segments to train a voice activity detection (VAD) model using only ECoG signals. We evaluated our approach using a leave-one-day-out cross-validation on open-loop recordings of a single dysarthric clinical trial participant living with ALS, and we compared the resulting performance to previous solutions trained with ground truth acoustic voice recordings. Main results. Our approach achieves a median timing error of around 530 ms with respect to the actual spoken speech. Embedded into a real-time BCI, our approach is capable of providing VAD results with a latency of only 10 ms. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, our results show for the first time that speech activity can be predicted purely from unlabeled ECoG signals, a crucial step toward individuals who cannot provide this information anymore due to their neurological condition, such as patients with locked-in syndrome.

      "content": "Objective. Neuromodulation therapies are often applied to peripheral nerves. These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. Approach. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Main results. Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit\u2019s underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. Significance. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons. These factors should be considered when selecting neuromodulation settings in animal subjects and human patients.",

We observed both indirect modulation during and/or after ICMS trains, as well as direct modulation time-locked to the individual S1-ICMS pulses within trains, with all possible combinations of the two types of modulation found among the majority of M1 and PMv neurons. Indirect effects were more prevalent and larger than direct effects. When S1-ICMS produced both indirect and direct modulation in the same neuron, the effects could both be excitatory, both inhibitory, or one excitatory and the other inhibitory. By simulating direct effects, we isolated the concurrent indirect effects, revealing that isolated direct effects failed to account for isolated indirect effects. Furthermore, indirect effects could be present 1 s or more after ICMS trains had terminated, when no direct effects could have occurred. Although the performance of movement decoders trained on visually-instructed trials was poor when applied to ICMS-instructed trials, decoders trained on ICMS-instructed trials performed well on ICMS-instructed trials, indicating that S1-ICMS altered the discharge of M1 and PMv neurons but did not degrade the decodable information available. Significance. When decoding movement intent from neural activity in M1 and/or PMv, accounting for indirect and direct modulation may improve the ability of bidirectional brain\u2013machine interfaces to incorporate artificial somatosensory feedback delivered with S1-ICMS and restore functional movement.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
