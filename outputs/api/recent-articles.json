      "title": "Foundation Model for Advancing Healthcare: Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions",
      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "title": "Data- and Physics-Driven Deep Learning Based Reconstruction for Fast MRI: Fundamentals and Methodologies",
      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "A clinical grade neurostimulation implant for hierarchical control of physiological activity",
      "content": "Bioelectronic implants for neurostimulation aim to steer disordered neurophysiological processes back towards a healthy state. However, physiology is subject to biological rhythms, including the circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake cycle. These predictable rhythms affect disease symptomatology, biomarkers used in closed-loop therapies, and a physiological system's expected response to stimulation. Therefore, therapeutic devices should incorporate feedforward elements to align algorithm parameters with predictable changes in physiological state, as a parallel of physiological rheostatic control. Here we introduce the DyNeuMo-2c, the first clinical-grade implant capable of delivering closed-loop neurostimulation while flexibly changing its functional configuration according to time of day. The device can chronically measure brain activity and motion state to track potential biomarker patterns in natural, out-of-clinic settings, allowing identification and targeting of patient-specific chronotypes. The system implements a hierarchical control flow, with baseline therapy set by a circadian scheduler, and adaptive policies layered to take effect based on specific biomarkers indicating patient and disease state. Using a benchtop validation setup, we demonstrate that the system has the required capabilities for delivering time-contingent closed-loop therapy in two established clinical use cases: Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Next, we deploy the system in vivo to deliver closed-loop deep brain stimulation in a healthy non-human primate model of vigilance, highlighting the importance of synchronisation between device operation and physiological state in various conditions (task performance, unconstrained behaviour, and sleep). Time-of-day-dependent adaptation of closed-loop stimulation enabled modulation of both vigilance and behaviour. Overall, the novel device architecture provides a proof-of-concept for delivering time-contingent therapy in chronic therapeutic settings where biological rhythms are of key importance.",

      "title": "Luteal-phase resistance training enhances nocturnal heat dissipation and delta power during sleep",
      "content": "Study Objectives: This study examined the effects of resistance training on sleep architecture, physiological heat dissipation, and {delta} power in young adult women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Methods: Twelve healthy young women participated in a four-condition crossover protocol comprising (1) follicular phase non-exercise, (2) follicular phase exercise, (3) luteal phase non-exercise, and (4) luteal phase exercise. The exercise condition consisted of 30 minutes of resistance training at 70% of one-repetition maximum performed during the day. During each night, electroencephalography, body temperature, and core body temperature were measured in the home environment. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (DPG), which is a validated indicator of heat dissipation, was calculated. Results: Resistance training enhanced heat dissipation, as reflected by increased DPG values, and increased the proportion of stage N3 sleep during both menstrual cycle phases, with more pronounced effects during the luteal phase. Sleep from bedtime to wake time was divided into four equal segments. Under the luteal phase with exercise, the appearance of stage N3, {delta} power, and the DPG were elevated in the mid-to-late segments of sleep. Conclusions: These findings suggest that daytime resistance training promotes nocturnal deep sleep and facilitates thermoregulatory heat loss, as indicated by an increased DPG, particularly during the luteal phase when thermoregulation is less stable than the follicular phase. This training may represent a practical intervention to improve sleep quality and physiological recovery in women across different phases of the menstrual cycle.",

      "content": "Objective. Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

      "title": "BGTransform: a neurophysiologically informed EEG data augmentation framework",
      "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

      "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) research has shown the efficacy of using motor and sensory-related neural signals to assist physically impaired patients. Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

      "title": "Inter-ictal spike rates are not modulated by anti-seizure medication taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit: a tale of two confounders *",
      "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

      "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
      "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",
