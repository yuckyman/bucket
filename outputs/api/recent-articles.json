The data set is uniquely curated, combining ground-truth data from Kaggle and real-world samples collected from blind schools, segmented into vowels and consonants. The proposed system demonstrates exceptional performance in feature extraction, classification accuracy, and addressing spatial misalignments in...",

      "title": "Identifying Traumatic Brain Injuries Using a Morlet Wavelet fNIRS Analysis in Role of Care 1 and 2 Environments: A Feasibility Study",
      "content": "CONCLUSION: The Morlet wavelet fNIRS analysis identified the injured region of the brain at initial, RTA, and RTP timepoints in ROC 1 and 2 environments. It did not detect differences in recovery, but there was an improvement in simple reaction time. Thus, the fNIRS analysis detected TBI's in ROC 1 and 2, but further development is needed to increase its sensitivity to tracking TBI's over time.",

This study investigates the applicability of Gestalt grouping principles in dynamic VR scenes, the influence of VR environments on grouping efficiency, and the relationship between viewer experience and grouping effects. (2) Methods: Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 42 participants using the HTC Vive Pro Eye and Tobii Pro Lab. Participants watched a...",

This study investigated the effects of two auditory cognitive load factors - sentence count (one vs two sentences) and speech rate (natural vs time-compressed) - on delayed sentence recall in younger and older listeners with normal and near-normal hearing. Forty participants (20 younger, M = 21.15 \u00b1 1.18 years; 20 older, M = 64.50 \u00b1 6.19 years) completed a...",

Rather than analyzing how a single brain responds, we can compare interactions and even synchronization between multiple actors in varying situations. This technique is commonly employed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Specifically, social cooperation and competition have been thoroughly investigated using this approach. While functional magnetic resonance...",

In this context, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for measuring brain activity in a natural, unconstrained environment. While interpersonal synchrony using fNIRS hyperscanning has been well-studied using statistical association analysis, establishing causal relationships...",
