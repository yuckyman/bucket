      "title": "DraftMarks: Enhancing Transparency in Human-AI Co-Writing Through Interactive Skeuomorphic Process Traces",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.23505v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI becomes part of everyday writing, questions of transparency and productive human effort are increasingly important. Educators, reviewers, and readers want to understand how AI shaped the process. Where was human effort focused? What role did AI play in the creation of the work? How did the interaction unfold? Existing approaches often reduce these dynamics to summary metrics or simplified provenance. We introduce DraftMarks, an augmented reading tool that surfaces the human-AI writing process through familiar physical metaphors. DraftMarks employs skeuomorphic encodings such as eraser crumbs to convey the intensity of revision, and masking tape or smudges to mark AI-generated content, simulating the process within the final written artifact. By using data from writer-AI interactions, DraftMarks' algorithm computes various collaboration metrics and writing traces. Through a formative study, we identified computational logic for different readership, and evaluated DraftMarks for its effectiveness in assessing AI co-authored writing.",

      "title": "NeuroBridge: Using Generative AI to Bridge Cross-neurotype Communication Differences through Neurotypical Perspective-taking",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.23434v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Communication challenges between autistic and neurotypical individuals stem from a mutual lack of understanding of each other's distinct, and often contrasting, communication styles. Yet, autistic individuals are expected to adapt to neurotypical norms, making interactions inauthentic and mentally exhausting for them. To help redress this imbalance, we build NeuroBridge, an online platform that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simulate: (a) an AI character that is direct and literal, a style common among many autistic individuals, and (b) four cross-neurotype communication scenarios in a feedback-driven conversation between this character and a neurotypical user. Through NeuroBridge, neurotypical individuals gain a firsthand look at autistic communication, and reflect on their role in shaping cross-neurotype interactions. In a user study with 12 neurotypical participants, we find that NeuroBridge improved their understanding of how autistic people may interpret language differently, with all describing autism as a social difference that \"needs understanding by others\" after completing the simulation. Participants valued its personalized, interactive format and described AI-generated feedback as \"constructive\", \"logical\" and \"non-judgmental\". Most perceived the portrayal of autism in the simulation as accurate, suggesting that users may readily accept AI-generated (mis)representations of disabilities. To conclude, we discuss design implications for disability representation in AI, the need for making NeuroBridge more personalized, and LLMs' limitations in modeling complex social scenarios.",

      "title": "Bridging the Trust Gap in Crowdfunding: A Novel Expert-Based Evaluation Mechanism",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.23378v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Crowdfunding has emerged as a vital alternative funding source, transforming how creative projects and startups secure financing by directly connecting creators to backers. However, persistent trust issues and information asymmetry between creators and backers significantly hinder its growth and development. Existing trust-enhancement mechanisms, such as third-party endorsements and basic expert validation often lack objectivity and robustness, leaving backers vulnerable to biased signals and project failures. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel trust-enhancement mechanism, referred to as Double-Score Voting. This approach refines expert validation systems by integrating two critical dimensions: firstly, a granular score-based vote from experts on a project's potential, moving beyond simple binary approval; and secondly, a weighted score representing the expert's credibility and level of expertise. This dual-layered evaluation provides a more nuanced, objective, and reliable assessment of project viability. The mechanism is formalised mathematically, and its practical implementation is demonstrated through CertiFund, a prototype crowdfunding platform developed to test and validate the concept. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Double-Score Voting mechanism can significantly mitigate information asymmetry, thereby increasing the credibility of projects and fostering a more trustworthy ecosystem for both creators and backers.",

      "title": "New Synthetic Goldmine: Hand Joint Angle-Driven EMG Data Generation Framework for Micro-Gesture Recognition",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.23359v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising approach for human-computer interaction. However, its performance is often limited by the scarcity of labeled EMG data, significant cross-user variability, and poor generalization to unseen gestures. To address these challenges, we propose SeqEMG-GAN, a conditional, sequence-driven generative framework that synthesizes high-fidelity EMG signals from hand joint angle sequences. Our method introduces a context-aware architecture composed of an angle encoder, a dual-layer context encoder featuring the novel Ang2Gist unit, a deep convolutional EMG generator, and a discriminator, all jointly optimized via adversarial learning. By conditioning on joint kinematic trajectories, SeqEMG-GAN is capable of generating semantically consistent EMG sequences, even for previously unseen gestures, thereby enhancing data diversity and physiological plausibility. Experimental results show that classifiers trained solely on synthetic data experience only a slight accuracy drop (from 57.77% to 55.71%). In contrast, training with a combination of real and synthetic data significantly improves accuracy to 60.53%, outperforming real-only training by 2.76%. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,also achieves the state-of-art performance in augmenting EMG datasets and enhancing gesture recognition performance for applications such as neural robotic hand control, AI/AR glasses, and gesture-based virtual gaming systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23327v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Asynchronous online discussions enable diverse participants to co-construct knowledge beyond individual contributions. This process ideally evolves through sequential phases, from superficial information exchange to deeper synthesis. However, many discussions stagnate in the early stages. Existing AI interventions typically target isolated phases, lacking mechanisms to progressively advance knowledge co-construction, and the impacts of different intervention styles in this context remain unclear and warrant investigation. To address these gaps, we conducted a design workshop to explore AI intervention strategies (task-oriented and/or relationship-oriented) throughout the knowledge co-construction process, and implemented them in an LLM-powered agent capable of facilitating progression while consolidating foundations at each phase. A within-subject study (N=60) involving five consecutive asynchronous discussions showed that the agent consistently promoted deeper knowledge progression, with different styles exerting distinct effects on both content and experience. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing adaptive AI agents that sustain more constructive online discussions.",

Their widespread adoption has shaped user experiences and community dynamics at scale. However, designing such systems requires a clear understanding of user needs, careful design decisions, and robust evaluation. While research on AI-infused systems for online communities has flourished in recent years, a comprehensive synthesis of this space remains absent. In this work, we present a systematic review of 77 studies, analyzing the systems they propose through three lenses: the challenges they aim to address, their design functionalities, and the evaluation strategies employed. The first two dimensions are organized around four core aspects of community participation: contribution, consumption, mediation, and moderation. Our analysis identifies common design and evaluation patterns, distills key design considerations, and highlights opportunities for future research on AI-infused systems in online communities.",

A-4 (Group: Control, Literacy, Persuader, Persuadee) * 2 (Time: Pre, Post) mixed factorial design was implemented over two weeks with 139 participants. The control group received no material. The literacy group attended two sessions focused on how behavior can be similar regardless of appearance cues. The persuader group completed three sessions, learning how to use such cues to influence others. The persuadee group attended three sessions involving the selection, justification, and reflection on personas and scenarios. Scenarios centered on financial and rental advice. A one-week gap followed before post-intervention testing. In both pre- and post-tests, participants assessed personas combining appearance cues, offering mobile hotspots with potential risk. They rated trust and willingness to take the risk. Validated measures and scenarios were used, including word-of-mouth and issue involvement scales. It was expected that cue influence would diminish post-intervention. However, no significant within- or between-group differences emerged. Findings raise concerns about the effectiveness of debiasing efforts and call for reconsideration of approaches using literacy, role-taking, rehearsal, drama, and simulation.",

Results demonstrate improved generalization and data-efficient calibration, highlighting the scalability and practicality of subject-adaptive BCIs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.22861v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Centralized content moderation paradigm both falls short and over-reaches: 1) it fails to account for the subjective nature of harm, and 2) it acts with blunt suppression in response to content deemed harmful, even when such content can be salvaged. We first investigate this through formative interviews, documenting how seemingly benign content becomes harmful due to individual life experiences. Based on these insights, we developed DIY-MOD, a browser extension that operationalizes a new paradigm: personalized content transformation. Operating on a user's own definition of harm, DIY-MOD transforms sensitive elements within content in real-time instead of suppressing the content itself. The system selects the most appropriate transformation for a piece of content from a diverse palette--from obfuscation to artistic stylizing--to match the user's specific needs while preserving the content's informational value. Our two-session user study demonstrates that this approach increases users' sense of agency and safety, enabling them to engage with content and communities they previously needed to avoid.",

To explore this gap, we shadowed meetings and interviewed data scientists at an organization, finding that practitioners perceived RAI as irrelevant to their work. Building on these insights and theoretical foundations, we derived design principles for engaging non-champions, and introduced sticky stories -- narratives of unexpected ML harms designed to be concrete, severe, surprising, diverse, and relevant, unlike widely circulated media to which practitioners are desensitized. Using a compound AI system, we generated and evaluated sticky stories through human and LLM assessments at scale, confirming they embodied the intended qualities. In a study with 29 practitioners, we found that, compared to regular stories, sticky stories significantly increased time spent on harm identification, broadened the range of harms recognized, and fostered deeper reflection.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23195v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to -10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive \"tree-scaffolding\" account of comprehension.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.24715v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field. Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent ``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a Schr\\\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics. Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime (correlation 0.12$\\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\\to$0.88). The framework strengthens structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled, testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain dynamics.",

      "title": "Brain Harmony: A Multimodal Foundation Model Unifying Morphology and Function into 1D Tokens",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.24693v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Brain Harmony (BrainHarmonix), the first multimodal brain foundation model that unifies structural morphology and functional dynamics into compact 1D token representations. The model was pretrained on two of the largest neuroimaging datasets to date, encompassing 64,594 T1-weighted structural MRI 3D volumes (~ 14 million images) and 70,933 functional MRI (fMRI) time series. BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience principles: structure complements function - structural and functional modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization; function follows structure - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain hub tokens. Notably, our dynamics encoder uniquely handles fMRI time series with heterogeneous repetition times (TRs), addressing a major limitation in existing models. BrainHarmonix is also the first to deeply compress high-dimensional neuroimaging signals into unified, continuous 1D tokens, forming a compact latent space of the human brain. BrainHarmonix achieves strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches. Our models - pretrained on 8 H100 GPUs - aim to catalyze a new era of AI-driven neuroscience powered by large-scale multimodal neuroimaging.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.24039v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.",

A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23524v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.",

Using structured social interactions between participants, we demonstrate that CEBRA can learn meaningful representations of joint neural activity that captures individual roles (speaker-listener) and other behavioral metrics. Our approach to characterizing interactions, as opposed to individual neural responses to stimuli, addresses the key principles of foundational model development: scalability and cross-subject generalization, opening new directions for representation learning in social neuroscience and clinical applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23342v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Theories of consciousness depend on data, and it needs to be appropriate data, without overwhelming confounding factors. The reports of Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) in [Metzinger 2024] relate to consciousness in a state purer than everyday consciousness, which may have fewer confounding factors. This essay suggests that the confounding factors, which are absent or diminished in MPE states, are related to language. The self which is absent in mindful states is a product of language. The link between language and MPE states is demonstrated by reference to the phenomenal reports in [Metzinger 2024]. Language, emotion, and mindfulness are analysed in terms of Bayesian pattern matching, or equivalently minimisation of Free Energy, using three types of pattern which are specific to humans. These types are the word patterns of language, self-patterns which drive our emotions and which are also a part of language, and mindful patterns. The practice of mindfulness involves learning mindful patterns, which compete with self-patterns and displace them, allowing mindful states to occur. Consequences of this picture for theories of consciousness, and their relation to MPE states, are explored.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23333v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.23104v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Studies of human decision-making demonstrate that environmental regularities, such as natural image statistics or intentionally nonuniform stimulus probabilities, can be exploited to improve efficiency (termed `efficient-coding'). Conversely, from a machine learning perspective, such nonuniform stimulus properties can lead to biased neural networks with poor generalization performance. Understanding how the brain flexibly leverages stimulus bias while maintaining robust generalization could lead to novel architectures that adaptively exploit environmental structure without sacrificing performance on out-of-distribution data. To address this disconnect, we investigated the impact of stimulus regularities in a 3-layer hierarchical continuous-time recurrent neural network (ctRNN) to better understand how artificial networks might exploit statistical regularities to improve efficiency while avoiding undesirable biases. We trained the model to reproduce one of six possible inputs under biased conditions (stimulus 1 more probable than stimuli 2-6) or unbiased conditions (all stimuli equally likely). Across all hidden layers, more information was encoded about high-probability stimuli, consistent with the efficient-coding framework. Importantly, reducing feedback from the final hidden layer of trained models selectively magnified representations of high-probability stimuli, at the expense of low-probability stimuli, across all layers. Together, these results suggest that models exploit nonuniform input statistics to improve efficiency, and that feedback pathways evolve to protect the processing of low-probability stimuli by regulating the impact of biased input statistics.",
