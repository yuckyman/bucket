      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The experimental results reveal that the redox properties of EPS exhibit significant variations depending on the electrode materials employed. Among them, the reactor (MEC-BTF3) utilizing dual carbon felts as the cathode and anode electrodes demonstrates the most outstanding degradation performance. Within...",

Due to its long-term consequences, there is also an expanding interest in adult-onset myopia. This review provides a comprehensive summary of interventions for slowing the onset and progression of myopia and discusses factors influencing their efficacy. Outdoor time is an effective intervention for at-risk pre-myopes, which can reduce myopia onset by up to 50% and has been implemented on a large scale...",

Our goal in this study was to quantify in vivo NHP lamina cribrosa (LC) shapes at low, normal, and elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs), and compare them with literature reported values for in vivo human LCs. We imaged the optic nerve heads (ONH) of seven eyes from six rhesus macaque monkeys using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)...",
