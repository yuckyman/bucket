      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Postural sway in multiple sclerosis patients: interaction of vision, surface, and fatigue effects",
      "content": "IntroductionPostural control impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in postural instability and increased fall risk. Sensory inputs are crucial to maintain balance adequately. Additionally, fatigue is one of the common and most disabling symptoms of MS, possibly contributing to postural deficits. Previous studies have examined the effects of fatigue and altered sensory conditions on postural control in patients with MS. The present study aimed to extend this knowledge by jointly assessing these factors within the same experimental framework, providing additional insight into how fatigue modulates sensory contributions to balance.MethodsA total of 21 patients with MS (age\u202f=\u202f41.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1\u202fyears; EDSS\u202f=\u202f1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; disease duration\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.9\u202fyears) completed balance assessments on firm and compliant surfaces with both eyes open and eyes closed, before and after a 6-min walk test used to induce fatigue. Postural sway was quantified using sway velocity and root mean square (RMS).ResultsThere was a significant effect of surface on sway velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.60), with a greater sway on the compliant surface compared to the firm surface. Fatigue significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.023, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23) but did not affect sway velocity (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The absence of visual input (eyes closed) also significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.46). There was a significant interaction between surface and vision for sway RMS (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.54), with a larger effect of surface instability in the eyes-closed condition.DiscussionPatients with MS face increased challenges in maintaining postural control under conditions of fatigue, surface instability, and lack of visual input. Sway RMS may be more sensitive to these effects than sway velocity.",

      "content": "BackgroundInner speech\u2014the covert articulation of words in one\u2019s mind\u2014is a fundamental phenomenon in human cognition with growing interest across BCI. This pilot study evaluates and compares deep learning models for inner-speech classification using non-invasive EEG derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset (4 participants, 8 words). The study assesses a compact CNN (EEGNet) and a spectro-temporal Transformer using leave-one-subject-out validation, reporting accuracy. Macro-F1, precision, and recall.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate and compare deep learning models for inner speech classification using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data, derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset. The goal is to assess the performance and generalizability of two architectures: the compact convolutional EEGNet and a novel spectro-temporal Transformer.MethodsData were obtained from four healthy participants who performed structured inner speech tasks involving eight target words. EEG signals were preprocessed and segmented into epochs for each imagined word. EEGNet and Transformer models were trained using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy. Performance metrics included accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, precision, and recall. An ablation study examined the contribution of Transformer components, including wavelet decomposition and self-attention mechanisms.ResultsThe spectro-temporal Transformer achieved the highest classification accuracy (82.4%) and macro-F1 score (0.70), outperforming both the standard and improved EEGNet models. Discriminative power was also substantially improved by using wavelet-based time-frequency features and attention mechanisms. Results showed that confusion patterns of social word categories outperformed those of number concepts, corresponding to different mental processing strategies.ConclusionDeep learning models, in particular attention-based Transformers, demonstrate great promise in decoding internal speech from EEG. These findings lay the groundwork for non-invasive, real-time BCIs for communication rehabilitation in severely disabled patients. Future work will take into account vocabulary expansion, wider participant variety, and real-time validation in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

      "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

      "content": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is a major cause of thunderclap headache and a preventable source of delayed ischaemic stroke. Despite expanding recognition, diagnosis is often delayed because early neuroimaging may be normal and vasoconstriction peaks in weeks two to three, and management remains experience-based rather than trial-anchored. In this mini-review we summarize advances in clinicoradiological definition and pathophysiology of tone dysregulation, outline risk-stratified diagnostic pathways built on serial CTA/MRA with confirmatory DSA when needed, high-resolution vessel-wall MRI to exclude inflammatory arteriopathy, perfusion MRI/CT and arterial spin labeling, and bedside transcranial Doppler, and appraise translational opportunities spanning time-anchored surveillance, perfusion-preserving care bundles and pragmatic endpoints. We also discuss enduring challenges\u2014including nosological overlap with primary CNS vasculitis, non-standardized imaging schedules, heterogeneous blood-pressure targets and a paucity of randomized data\u2014that temper implementation. By integrating time-aware vascular and perfusion readouts (e.g., planned week-2\u20133 repeat angiography, ASL hypoperfusion mapping, sustained Doppler velocities) with trigger withdrawal, cautious blood-pressure management and symptomatic vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium in selected contexts, emerging strategies aim to preserve cerebral perfusion, anticipate delayed infarction and standardize follow-up across settings. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of RCVS care and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for prospective evaluation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.",

      "content": "ObjectiveColor and spatial location are key cues influencing visual selection in binocular color rivalry, jointly modulating attentional resource allocation and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. However, how these cues\u2014individually and in combination\u2014regulate ocular behavior and PFC activation remains insufficiently understood and lacks systematic empirical investigation.MethodsThis study integrates eye tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and reaction time measurements to systematically investigate the cortical and oculomotor response characteristics under a binocular rivalry paradigm, focusing on color rivalry (Color stimuli), spatial location (Location stimuli), and their combined (Color & Location stimuli).ResultsThe results revealed that Color stimuli elicited rapid saccades, significant pupil dilation, and a decrease in prefrontal HbO concentration. Location stimuli induced stable saccadic patterns and a typical biphasic HbR response in BA46. The combined Color & Location stimuli triggered significant changes in oculomotor behavior during the later processing stage, accompanied by a marked increase in HbO activation in BA10, suggesting its dominant role in multisensory integration and cognitive resource reallocation. Further coupling analyses showed a significant positive correlation between prefrontal HbO concentration and reaction time (r = 0.555, p < 0.01), and a significant negative correlation between HbO concentration and saccade amplitude (r = \u20130.376, p < 0.05), consistent with the theoretical predictions of the \u201cneural efficiency\u2013cognitive load trade-off\u201d model. Task-dependent coupling relationship were also observed among oculomotor parameters and between eye movement and cerebral hemodynamic signals.ConclusionColor stimuli induce rapid saccadic behavior and impose higher prefrontal load, Location stimuli engage a more efficient dorsal pathway, while Color & Location stimuli intensify resource rivalry and induce a processing bottleneck, manifested as prolonged reaction times co-occurring with heightened cortical activation.",

      "title": "Functional activity changes after vergence and accommodative rehabilitation of concussion-related convergence insufficiency: CONCUSS clinical trial fMRI results",
      "content": "IntroductionThe CONCUSS clinical trial examined the neural changes associated with office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with movement (OBVAM) in concussion-related convergence insufficiency (CONC-CI).MethodsThe following assessments were collected at baseline and post-OBVAM therapy: activity evoked from a functional MRI vergence oculomotor task, near point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence (PFV), vergence facility (VF), and visual symptoms from a sensorimotor vision exam. Fifty-four CONC-CI participants, diagnosed with persisting concussion symptoms between one- and six-months post-injury, were analyzed in group-level results.ResultsFunctional activity in the vergence oculomotor network, specifically the frontal eye fields, supplemental eye fields, parietal eye fields, cerebellar vermis (CV), and visual cortex, increased post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments. Significant increases in post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments were observed in the visual cortex (bilateral V3 and right area PH) and the CV, via a paired t-test with family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The pooled baseline and post-OBVAM measures revealed that the bilateral functional activities of V3 and CV were significantly correlated with the NPC, PFV, and VF clinical signs, and the right hemisphere area PH within the visual cortex was significantly correlated with VF (Bonferroni-corrected; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To determine whether the CONC-CI post-OBVAM functional brain activity differed from that of the binocularly normal control (BNC) data, an unpaired t-test was performed comparing 46 age-matched BNC datasets with 54 CONC-CI datasets. Significant differences in functional activity between BNC and CONC-CI at post-OBVAM datasets were not observed (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).DiscussionResults support that OBVAM improves functional brain activity in CONC-CI correlated with NPC, PFV, and VF.",

      "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",
