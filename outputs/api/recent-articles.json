      "title": "Cross-species consensus atlas of the primate basal ganglia",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are conserved brain regions essential for motor control, learning, emotion, and cognition, and are implicated in neurological and psychiatric disease. Yet a unified cross-species taxonomy of BG cell types is lacking, limiting translation of BG circuit mechanisms, interpretation of human genetic risk, and development of cell type-targeted tools. We present a multiomic consensus atlas of 1.8 million nuclei from human, macaque, and marmoset spanning eight BG structures. Integrating cross-species gene expression, open chromatin, and spatial profiling enables definition of conserved and divergent cell types. Alignment to existing mouse and human atlases identifies 61 homologous cell types conserved over 80 million years. We identify a STRd D2 StrioMat Hybrid medium spiny neuron (MSN) type with molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological features that clarify hybrid MSN identities. Comparative cis-regulatory analysis reveals conserved sequence grammars that encode cell identity and inform viral targeting strategies, providing a foundational resource for BG evolution, function, and disease.",

      "title": "Neural pathways of voice perception: a comparative dMRI study between humans and macaques.",
      "content": "The processing of vocal stimuli in the human brain involves multiple regions that are selectively tuned to voice information. Similarly, voice-sensitive areas have been identified in macaques, suggesting a common neural mechanism across species. However, the structural connectivity underlying voice perception in both humans and macaques remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the structural connectivity of voice-sensitive regions in 4 humans and 3 macaques using awake functional MRI and diffusion MRI techniques. Our findings reveal that while humans and macaques differ in the anatomical organization of projections from the anterior Temporal Voice Area (aTVA), the organization of projections from the primary auditory cortex (A1) is nearly identical. Our results also demonstrate distinct connectivity patterns between the vocal areas of the two species, as well as an opposite pattern of lateralization of aTVA-A1 connectivity in humans and macaques. These results enhance our understanding of the neural circuits involved in voice perception and provide valuable insights into the comparative neurobiology of vocal communication.",

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.
