      "title": "Elements of Olfactory Intelligence in Drosophila",
      "content": "The ability to make the world of odorants intelligible is a key capability of the Drosophila olfactory system that we shall call olfactory intelligence. We argue that olfactory intelligence does not only arise in the form of associative learning in the Mushroom Body, but can be seen throughout the first three stages of the early olfactory system: the Antenna, the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body Calyx, where encoding and processing of odorants take places. Characterizing the structure and logic of the code underlying the spike trains accessing the memory in the Mushroom Body is a major challenge in neuroscience. To address this challenge and unveil the key elements of olfactory intelligence, we extensively model the function of the Drosophila early olfactory system from its intriguing connectome. We start by modeling the space of odorants using constructs of both semantic and syntactic information. Odorant semantics concerns the identity of odorants while odorant syntax pertains to their concentration amplitude. These odorant attributes are multiplicatively coupled in the process of olfactory transduction. To make the world of odorants intelligible, we establish that the Drosophila Antennal Lobe and Calyx largely reduce the concentration dependency of the odorant information from the confounding representation of the Antenna, and thereby disentangle the odorant semantic information from the odorant syntactic information. We also introduce a novel time and rank-based representation of Kenyon Cell (KC) outputs, called the marked first spike sequence code. We compare the cumulative inter-spike interval statistics of odorant semantics and introduce a novel distance measure for the accurate classification of odorant semantics. Computationally, these elements of olfactory intelligence are realized by a class of differential divisive normalization processors (DNPs) modeling the feedback circuits in the Antennal Lobe facilitated by Local Neurons and in the Calyx by the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. The marked first spike sequence code at the output of the DNP circuit of the Calyx provides a novel representation of the odorant semantics. The code reflects the amplitude ranking that drives the KCs in the time domain. Strikingly, the APL feedback not only removes the concentration dependency of the KC outputs, but also increases the ranking distance between the marked first spike sequence codes representing different odorant identities. Thus, the rank-based representation supports accurate classification of odorant semantics.",

      "title": "Ultrashort optical-pin excitation for scattering brain imaging",
      "content": "Imaging neural structures deep in brain tissue is central to understanding brain function, yet remains fundamentally limited by strong optical scattering and the requirement for accurate three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Laser-scanning microscopy is a promising technique for brain imaging; however, maintaining excitation focus integrity in scattering media while preserving axial confinement poses a persistent photonic challenge. Here we introduce the optical pin, an ultrashort excitation regime engineered at the angular-spectrum level to address this limitation. By broadening the transverse angular bandwidth of a Bessel-type field while preserving its conical momentum-space architecture, the optical pin introduces a controlled longitudinal wave-vector spread that compresses the axial interference length to the micrometer scale, restoring Gaussian-like sectioning without sacrificing multi-angle interference. This excitation design yields substantially enhanced imaging performance, including ~1.5-fold contrast improvement and ~2.6-fold increased robustness to scattering. We validate the approach across transparent, scattering, and biological specimens, including bead phantoms, C. elegans, and mouse brain tissue. As a system-level excitation strategy, the optical pin is readily compatible with existing laser-scanning microscopy platforms and is particularly suited for scattering-limited brain imaging.",

Recently, they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation\u2014multiple accounts posting \"tips\" that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake enthusiasm in comments. The most prominent example was a 2,000+ upvote post removed by moderators for manipulation, but it's part of a sustained campaign across the subreddit.<p>*Sources:*<p>[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/\n[2] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1jsb00a/\n[3] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1ohcohi/\n[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/comment/nqmhal3/\n[5] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/na94upv/\n[6] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/na8zvs4/\n[7] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1mej900/\n[8] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1my1ajx/comment/nagdkl5/\n[9] https://www.trustpilot.com/review/oneprep.xyz</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Operations Near the Edge of cognitive decline: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of cognitive load in Mild cognitive impairment",
      "content": "Motivation: Early detection of cognitive strain is essential for identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and its progression to more severe neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates cognitive strain in MCI by examining both behavioral and neural correlates during a real-world task. Methods: Twenty-four older adults (M=69, 14 male, 10 female), including 11 with MCI and 13 healthy controls (MMSE >22/30), performed a spatial navigation task under varying memory load. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to capture error-related potentials (ErrPs), which reflect cognitive load and processing errors. Results: Both groups showed a decline in working memory performance as cognitive load increased ({beta} = -41.39, SE = 10.73, t(90) = -3.86, p < .001). MCI participants, however, exhibited more efficient use of non-intrinsic (allocentric) reference frames under high cognitive load ({beta} = 2.47, SE = 0.95, t(82) = 2.61, p = .009). MCI individuals also displayed larger ErrPs in central brain regions, indicating greater neural resource allocation. Additionally, MCI participants showed a decrease in parietal-to-frontal theta dominance under high load ({beta} = -0.68, SE = 0.32, t(90) = -2.12, p = .037), and reduced fronto-parietal connectivity. Discussion: These findings suggest that MCI participants experience greater cognitive strain, evidenced by increased neural resource allocation and strategy-shifting under load. This heightened strain may serve as an early marker of MCI progression, offering potential for early detection of pathological changes.",

      "title": "Facilitating the Supplementary Motor Area Activity Reduces Variability of Ball Arrival Position in Accurate Ball Throwing Performance",
      "content": "Maintaining high accuracy during rapid, dynamic movements is a significant challenge for the central nervous system. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a key cortical region for orchestrating motor commands and regulating movement variability, yet its causal role in maintaining precision during high-speed tasks remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of modulating SMA excitability on throwing performance in fourteen healthy novices. Participants performed maximal and submaximal (50% effort) throwing tasks before and after receiving intermittent (facilitatory) or continuous (inhibitory) theta burst stimulation (TBS) over the SMA. Outcome measures included ball speed, variability of pitch location--quantified as variable error (95% confidence ellipse area) and absolute error (Euclidean distance from the ellipse center to the target)--and introspective ratings of performance via visual analog scales (VAS). Results showed that intermittent TBS (iTBS) significantly reduced the variable error of pitch location during maximal-effort throwing--where neural noise is theoretically elevated--without compromising ball speed. In contrast, no significant changes in performance were observed following continuous TBS or during the submaximal throwing task. Notably, objective precision gains under iTBS were dissociated from subjective ratings of accuracy, which increased globally over time independent of stimulation type. These findings demonstrate that the SMA plays a critical causal role in stabilizing motor output under high motor drive. This study suggests that SMA-mediated stabilization operates as a subconscious process, offering new insights for optimizing complex motor skills.",
