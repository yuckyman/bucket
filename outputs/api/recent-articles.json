      "title": "Resting-state Functional Connections with the Hippocampus and with the Caudate Nucleus Predict Working Memory Performance in Multiple Sclerosis",
      "content": "Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). A related process, working memory (WM), supports long-term EM and is often also impaired. Functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and caudate nucleus supports EM performance. However, this connectivity's specific influences on WM performance in MS is relatively unknown. Resting-state FC (RSFC) possesses clinical utility, including predicting cognitive impairments before they are captured by assessment. The present study tested whether RSFC with the hippocampus and caudate could predict WM performance in people with MS and in healthy individuals (HC). In a secondary analysis of 78 participants (42 MS, 36 HC), RSFC between the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and other regions was quantified. These connections' predictive influence on WM performance was then examined using a global WM performance measure for a subset with available neuropsychological data (26 MS, 15 HC). Across the entire sample (N=78), MS participants displayed stronger coupling between the right hippocampus and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to HC participants. Within MS participants, stronger coupling between the left hippocampus (LHipp) and left ventral anterior cingulate (LvACC), and between the left caudate (LCaud) and right insula, were observed. Stronger decoupling between the LHipp and left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG) also emerged. Stronger LHipp-LvACC connectivity predicted worse WM performance, whereas stronger LHipp-LSMG connectivity and LCaud-RInsula connectivity each predicted better performance. The hippocampal connections were also inversely correlated. Findings identify a caudate circuit and potential hippocampal network whose aberrant, intrinsic activity could serve as neural markers for WM dysfunction in MS.",

      "title": "Architecture of Near-Death Experience Spaces",
      "content": "Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) challenge conventional research methods, as they are often described as exceeding the limits of verbal expression. While most studies rely on narrative accounts, little attention has been given to graphic representations as a complementary mode of investigation. This study employs a hybrid approach combining a semi-structured digital questionnaire with a graphic reconstruction task. Participants first segmented their Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and NDE into distinct experiential sequences by assigning chronological numbers to each phase. This sequencing enabled the identification and isolation of the core NDE component across participants. The graphic reconstructions represent each perceived space, Self-Location (S-L), the perceived spatial position where one experiences oneself to be located and Self-Motion (S-M), the perceived spatial trajectories and directionalities of oneself within these visuo-spatial configurations. This dual-method design was intended to capture experiential features of OBEs and NDEs that may not be conveyed through verbal reports alone. Notably, OBEs have rarely been examined regarding their independence from or conjunction with NDEs, nor their placement within the overall temporal sequence. The graphic reconstructions revealed consistent visual-field invariants: conical forms, elliptic arcs with variable Visual-Field Extents (VFE), and ellipsoidal configurations, each correlated with specific chromatic and luminance perceptual qualities of the Visual Field (VF).",

      "title": "Postural sway in multiple sclerosis patients: interaction of vision, surface, and fatigue effects",
      "content": "IntroductionPostural control impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in postural instability and increased fall risk. Sensory inputs are crucial to maintain balance adequately. Additionally, fatigue is one of the common and most disabling symptoms of MS, possibly contributing to postural deficits. Previous studies have examined the effects of fatigue and altered sensory conditions on postural control in patients with MS. The present study aimed to extend this knowledge by jointly assessing these factors within the same experimental framework, providing additional insight into how fatigue modulates sensory contributions to balance.MethodsA total of 21 patients with MS (age\u202f=\u202f41.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1\u202fyears; EDSS\u202f=\u202f1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; disease duration\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.9\u202fyears) completed balance assessments on firm and compliant surfaces with both eyes open and eyes closed, before and after a 6-min walk test used to induce fatigue. Postural sway was quantified using sway velocity and root mean square (RMS).ResultsThere was a significant effect of surface on sway velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.60), with a greater sway on the compliant surface compared to the firm surface. Fatigue significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.023, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23) but did not affect sway velocity (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The absence of visual input (eyes closed) also significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.46). There was a significant interaction between surface and vision for sway RMS (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.54), with a larger effect of surface instability in the eyes-closed condition.DiscussionPatients with MS face increased challenges in maintaining postural control under conditions of fatigue, surface instability, and lack of visual input. Sway RMS may be more sensitive to these effects than sway velocity.",

      "content": "BackgroundInner speech\u2014the covert articulation of words in one\u2019s mind\u2014is a fundamental phenomenon in human cognition with growing interest across BCI. This pilot study evaluates and compares deep learning models for inner-speech classification using non-invasive EEG derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset (4 participants, 8 words). The study assesses a compact CNN (EEGNet) and a spectro-temporal Transformer using leave-one-subject-out validation, reporting accuracy. Macro-F1, precision, and recall.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate and compare deep learning models for inner speech classification using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data, derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset. The goal is to assess the performance and generalizability of two architectures: the compact convolutional EEGNet and a novel spectro-temporal Transformer.MethodsData were obtained from four healthy participants who performed structured inner speech tasks involving eight target words. EEG signals were preprocessed and segmented into epochs for each imagined word. EEGNet and Transformer models were trained using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy. Performance metrics included accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, precision, and recall. An ablation study examined the contribution of Transformer components, including wavelet decomposition and self-attention mechanisms.ResultsThe spectro-temporal Transformer achieved the highest classification accuracy (82.4%) and macro-F1 score (0.70), outperforming both the standard and improved EEGNet models. Discriminative power was also substantially improved by using wavelet-based time-frequency features and attention mechanisms. Results showed that confusion patterns of social word categories outperformed those of number concepts, corresponding to different mental processing strategies.ConclusionDeep learning models, in particular attention-based Transformers, demonstrate great promise in decoding internal speech from EEG. These findings lay the groundwork for non-invasive, real-time BCIs for communication rehabilitation in severely disabled patients. Future work will take into account vocabulary expansion, wider participant variety, and real-time validation in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Multimodal neurobehavioral integration in binocular color rivalry: cortical-eye movement analysis under color, location, and combined stimuli",
      "content": "ObjectiveColor and spatial location are key cues influencing visual selection in binocular color rivalry, jointly modulating attentional resource allocation and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. However, how these cues\u2014individually and in combination\u2014regulate ocular behavior and PFC activation remains insufficiently understood and lacks systematic empirical investigation.MethodsThis study integrates eye tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and reaction time measurements to systematically investigate the cortical and oculomotor response characteristics under a binocular rivalry paradigm, focusing on color rivalry (Color stimuli), spatial location (Location stimuli), and their combined (Color & Location stimuli).ResultsThe results revealed that Color stimuli elicited rapid saccades, significant pupil dilation, and a decrease in prefrontal HbO concentration. Location stimuli induced stable saccadic patterns and a typical biphasic HbR response in BA46. The combined Color & Location stimuli triggered significant changes in oculomotor behavior during the later processing stage, accompanied by a marked increase in HbO activation in BA10, suggesting its dominant role in multisensory integration and cognitive resource reallocation. Further coupling analyses showed a significant positive correlation between prefrontal HbO concentration and reaction time (r = 0.555, p < 0.01), and a significant negative correlation between HbO concentration and saccade amplitude (r = \u20130.376, p < 0.05), consistent with the theoretical predictions of the \u201cneural efficiency\u2013cognitive load trade-off\u201d model. Task-dependent coupling relationship were also observed among oculomotor parameters and between eye movement and cerebral hemodynamic signals.ConclusionColor stimuli induce rapid saccadic behavior and impose higher prefrontal load, Location stimuli engage a more efficient dorsal pathway, while Color & Location stimuli intensify resource rivalry and induce a processing bottleneck, manifested as prolonged reaction times co-occurring with heightened cortical activation.",

      "title": "Chronic pain and cognitive dysfunction: clinical manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and emerging therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe CONCUSS clinical trial examined the neural changes associated with office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with movement (OBVAM) in concussion-related convergence insufficiency (CONC-CI).MethodsThe following assessments were collected at baseline and post-OBVAM therapy: activity evoked from a functional MRI vergence oculomotor task, near point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence (PFV), vergence facility (VF), and visual symptoms from a sensorimotor vision exam. Fifty-four CONC-CI participants, diagnosed with persisting concussion symptoms between one- and six-months post-injury, were analyzed in group-level results.ResultsFunctional activity in the vergence oculomotor network, specifically the frontal eye fields, supplemental eye fields, parietal eye fields, cerebellar vermis (CV), and visual cortex, increased post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments. Significant increases in post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments were observed in the visual cortex (bilateral V3 and right area PH) and the CV, via a paired t-test with family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The pooled baseline and post-OBVAM measures revealed that the bilateral functional activities of V3 and CV were significantly correlated with the NPC, PFV, and VF clinical signs, and the right hemisphere area PH within the visual cortex was significantly correlated with VF (Bonferroni-corrected; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To determine whether the CONC-CI post-OBVAM functional brain activity differed from that of the binocularly normal control (BNC) data, an unpaired t-test was performed comparing 46 age-matched BNC datasets with 54 CONC-CI datasets. Significant differences in functional activity between BNC and CONC-CI at post-OBVAM datasets were not observed (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).DiscussionResults support that OBVAM improves functional brain activity in CONC-CI correlated with NPC, PFV, and VF.",

      "title": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome\u2013related headache and delayed cerebral infarction: a mini review",
      "content": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is a major cause of thunderclap headache and a preventable source of delayed ischaemic stroke. Despite expanding recognition, diagnosis is often delayed because early neuroimaging may be normal and vasoconstriction peaks in weeks two to three, and management remains experience-based rather than trial-anchored. In this mini-review we summarize advances in clinicoradiological definition and pathophysiology of tone dysregulation, outline risk-stratified diagnostic pathways built on serial CTA/MRA with confirmatory DSA when needed, high-resolution vessel-wall MRI to exclude inflammatory arteriopathy, perfusion MRI/CT and arterial spin labeling, and bedside transcranial Doppler, and appraise translational opportunities spanning time-anchored surveillance, perfusion-preserving care bundles and pragmatic endpoints. We also discuss enduring challenges\u2014including nosological overlap with primary CNS vasculitis, non-standardized imaging schedules, heterogeneous blood-pressure targets and a paucity of randomized data\u2014that temper implementation. By integrating time-aware vascular and perfusion readouts (e.g., planned week-2\u20133 repeat angiography, ASL hypoperfusion mapping, sustained Doppler velocities) with trigger withdrawal, cautious blood-pressure management and symptomatic vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium in selected contexts, emerging strategies aim to preserve cerebral perfusion, anticipate delayed infarction and standardize follow-up across settings. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of RCVS care and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for prospective evaluation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.",
