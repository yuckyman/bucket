      "title": "Multiarrangement: A Plug & Play Geometric Data CollectionPackage For Video Stimuli",
      "content": "We present Multiarrangement, an offline, open-source Python toolkit for collecting human similarity judgments for video stimuli through multi-arrangement tasks. Participants arrange subsets of stimuli in a 2D arena such that Euclidean distances reflect perceived dissimilarity. The toolkit supports two experiment paradigms: a set-cover scheduling system that uses combinatorial cover designs to guarantee pair coverage with minimal trials, aiming to avoid overwhelming the participant for stimulus-rich settings, and an adaptive Lift-the-Weakest scheduling that focuses each new trial on the globally least certain pair and informative neighbors. Across trials, partial distance evidence is integrated into a representational dissimilarity matrix using normalized weighted averaging, with an optional inverse MDS refinement that minimizes cross-trial prediction error. We document task design, algorithms, evaluations, and provide practical guidance for easy and reliable usage",

      "title": "Inhibition of CGRP receptor ameliorates AD pathology by reprogramming lipid metabolism through HDAC11/LXR\u03b2/ABCA1 signaling",
      "content": "The Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor has gained attention in Alzheimers Disease (AD) research due to its involvement in regulating neuroinflammation. However, its role and mechanism in AD pathology remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CALCRL, a core component of the CGRP receptor, is upregulated in the hippocampus of AD dementia patients and 5FAD mice. Knockout of the CGRP receptor ligand Calca or pharmacological blockade using Rimegepant (Rim), reduces soluble A{beta}1-42 oligomer-induced neuronal death and glial inflammation. Rim treatment also rescues neurobehavioral impairments, neurodegeneration, and lipid metabolism dysfunction in 5FAD mice. Mechanistically, these effects are mediated through HDAC11 inhibition, which enhances LXR{beta} acetylation and ABCA1 expression, promoting the reprogramming of neuronal lipid metabolism. Importantly, this CALCRL/HDAC11/LXR{beta}/ABCA1 axis is conserved across both humans and mice. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism underlying AD pathogenesis and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting CGRP signaling in AD.",
