      "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
      "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

      "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

      "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

      "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

      "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

      "title": "Resolving the estrogen paradox in hereditary retinal degeneration: Esr1 activation suppresses Tnf-\u03b1 signaling as a photoreceptor self-protection mechanism",
      "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disorder characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss and irreversible blindness. Increasing evidence implicates neuroinflammation as a contributor to photoreceptor degeneration extending beyond the initial genetic insult. Although estrogen has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system, its role in RP remains controversial, with some studies suggesting a paradoxical exacerbation of retinal pathology. To address this discrepancy, we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) as a central immunoregulatory hub in RP. Transcriptomic analyses of rd1 and rd10 revealed upregulation of estrogen-responsive and inflammatory pathways, with Esr1 expression markedly elevated during degeneration. TUNEL assays demonstrated that systemic estradiol (E2) exerted divergent effects, protective in rd1 yet deleterious in rd10, whereas selective pharmacological activation of Esr1 with propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) consistently reduced photoreceptor death, preserved dark-adapted ERG responses, and downregulated inflammatory mediators including Tnf-, Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1, Cd68, and Iba1. Mechanistically, Esr1 activation repressed microglial Tnf transcription and disrupted a self-sustaining Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1-Tnf- signaling loop driving microglial recruitment, activation and neurotoxicity in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Targeted interventions confirmed tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (Tnfr1) as the principal mediator of Tnf-induced photoreceptor death: selective inhibition with R7050 conferred superior protection compared with broad-spectrum Tnf- inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab). Cx3cr1 blockade likewise suppressed microglial activation and improved visual outcomes. Collectively, our findings establish Esr1 activation as not merely an external intervention but the amplification of an intrinsic self-protective program, positioning Esr1, Tnfr1, and Cx3cr1 as actionable therapeutic targets to suppress neuroinflammation and preserve vision in RP and related retinal disorders.",

      "title": "Test-retest reliability of sensorimotor activity measured with spinal cord fMRI",
      "content": "Establishing the reliability of spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is critical before employing it to assess experimental or clinical interventions. Previous studies have mapped human motor activity primarily to the ipsilateral ventral horn, aligning with myotomal and dermatomal projections. Despite these insights, the test-retest reliability of spinal fMRI remains under-investigated. Here we assessed spinal cord activation during a sensorimotor paradigm involving right-hand grasping and grip force estimation in 30 healthy volunteers. Participants completed two identical scanning visits, each time performing the same task twice, enabling the investigation of test-retest reliability both within a single experimental visit and between visits performed on different days. Aggregating all task runs, motor-evoked activation was observed in ipsilateral ventro-dorsal regions of spinal segmental levels C6-C8 and T2, as well as in medial regions of levels C1-C3. Despite highly reliable task performance (grip force) and fMRI signal quality (temporal signal-to-noise ratio), the reliability of motor activation was predominantly poor both within and between visits, with notable variability in spatial distribution observed across task runs. Increasing the number of task runs per individual improved the robustness of group-level activation, as indexed by higher activated voxel count, larger cluster spatial extent, and attenuated t-statistic distribution. Although we demonstrated that motor-evoked activation corresponds to the known neuroanatomical organisation of motor circuits, its low test-retest reliability presents a challenge for wider applications of spinal fMRI. Understanding the drivers of low reliability in functional imaging is warranted, but we suggest that looking beyond measurement error is required, including careful consideration of inherent within-individual variability underpinned by neurophysiological and psychological factors.",

      "title": "Representational Geometries of Perception and Working Memory: A Pilot Study",
      "content": "This study aims to compare the neural representational geometry of visual perception and visual working memory using human fMRI. In our pilot experiment, observers viewed a face-scene blended image (sample) and selectively attended to either the face or scene aspects of the sample. They then judged whether the attended aspects were the same as or different from that of the subsequent test image. In three out of four observers, we found that the coding axis, which distinguishes faces and scenes, was rotated when perceptual content transforms into working memory, not only in the visual cortex but also in some higher association cortical areas. In these regions, exclusive combinations (i.e., perceived face and memorized scene vs. perceived scene and memorized face) were successfully classified by linear decoders, indicating that perception and working memory are represented in partially distinct subspaces. Such specific coding may help prevent confusion between perception and memory. Meanwhile, however, cross-decoding of visual contents across perception and working memory was also robust, indicating common coding components between them. Such common coding may help to explain why even though we generally have no difficulty in distinguishing working memory content from perceptual content, there is yet a sense in which their contents are qualitatively similar. Hereby, we pre-register the hypotheses, experimental design, analysis plan, and stopping rule for data collection before examining whether these preliminary results can be replicated in a larger sample.",

      "title": "Decoding Spine Nanostructure in Mental Disorders Reveals a Schizophrenia-Linked Role for Ecrg4",
      "content": "Dendritic spine dysfunction may contribute to the etiology and symptom expression of neuropsychiatric disorders. The intimate relationship between spine morphology and function suggests that decoding disease-related abnormalities from spine morphology can aid in developing synapse-targeted interventions. Here, we describe a population analysis of dendritic spine nanostructure applied to the objective grouping of multiple mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. This method has identified two major groups of spine phenotypes linked to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An increase in spine subpopulation with small volumes characterized the spines of schizophrenia mouse models, whereas a spine subset with large volumes increased in ASD models. Schizophrenia mouse models showed higher similarity in spine morphology, which was caused by a reduced speed of nascent spine growth. The expression of Ecrg4, a gene encoding small secretory peptides, was increased in schizophrenia mouse models, and functional studies confirmed its critical involvement in impaired spine dynamics and shape in schizophrenia mouse models. These results suggest that the population-level spine analysis provides rich information about the heterogeneous spine pathology, which facilitates identification of new molecular targets related to core synaptic dysfunction.",

      "title": "Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neural Activity Switches Simultaneously with Rule Representations in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>",
