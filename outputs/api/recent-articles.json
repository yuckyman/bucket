      "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a widely accessible, noninvasive technique capable of modulating cortical excitability. A rapidly expanding body of sports-science literature suggests that it can produce modest but measurable gains in endurance, strength, skill acquisition, and perceived exertion. This editorial reviews the physiological mechanisms underlying tDCS, evaluates the evidence for its ergogenic effects, and situates the technology within the broader...",

Iman and I (Fabian) have been building Specific for a while now and are finally opening up our public beta.<p>Specific is a platform for building backend APIs and services entirely through natural-language specifications and tests, without writing code. We then automatically turn your specs into a working system and deploy it for you, along with any infrastructure needed.<p>We know a lot of developers who have already adopted spec-driven development to focus on high-level design and let coding agents take care of implementation. We are attempting to take this even further by making the specs themselves the source of truth. Of course, we can\u2019t blindly trust coding agents to follow the spec, so we also support adding tests that will run to ensure the system behaves as expected and to avoid regressions.<p>There is so much ground to cover, so we are focusing on a smaller set of initial features that in our experience should cover a large portion of backends:<p>- An HTTP server for each project. Authentication can be added by simply stating in the spec how you want to protect your endpoint.<p>- A database automatically spun up and schema configured if the spec indicates persistence is needed.<p>- External APIs can be called. You can even link out to API docs in your specs.<p>You currently can\u2019t see the generated code, but we are working on enabling it. Of course, we don\u2019t claim any ownership of the generated code and will gladly let you export it and continue building elsewhere.<p>Specific is free to try and we are really eager to hear your feedback on it!<p>Try it here: <a href=\"https://app.specific.dev\">https://app.specific.dev</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Noninvasive neuromodulation enables brain stimulation without surgery but requires precise optimization of stimulation parameters to ensure efficacy and safety. Direct testing on human or animal subjects is costly, time intensive, and constrained by ethical and safety considerations. To address these challenges, a low-cost, versatile brain phantom was designed to emulate key biophysical properties across multiple neuromodulation modalities. The phantom was fabricated using ground beef, sodium alginate, and starch, and cast within a custom 3D printed mold. A multimodal test platform was created and validated by integrating established principles from low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and thermal phantom design. Numerical simulations predicted a LIFU peak negative pressure of 0.631 MPa, closely matching the target Pr.3 value, with negligible temperature elevation (<0.01 {degrees}C). Consistent with prior reports, tDCS exposure did not induce lasting alterations in the phantoms physical or electrical properties. The electrical conductivity was 0.11{+/-}0.02 S/m, reflecting water saturation within the phantom matrix; the thermal conductivity averaged 0.557 W/(mK), consistent with reported values for brain tissue analogs. This study primarily evaluated LIFU and tDCS performance; future work should extend characterization to additional modalities such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Further assessment of the phantoms optical properties would also facilitate photobiomodulation and photoacoustic imaging studies. Overall, this inexpensive, easily fabricated phantom presents a practical and adaptable platform for multimodal neuromodulation research and parameter optimization.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
