      "content": "Defective cortical development with aberrant neuronal distribution is linked to diverse human pathologies. We show that downregulation of protocadherin-8, a cell-adhesion protein associated with autism and schizophrenia, disrupts neuronal migration and morphology, and increases proliferation in the developing mouse cortex. These findings identify protocadherin-8 as a critical determinant of cortical organization and implicate it in the potential molecular mechanisms underlying human brain pathology.",

      "title": "Four phases and temporal threshold of population calcium response during locomotion in cortical astrocytes",
      "content": "Calcium activity is a major form of astrocyte excitability essential to their function and plasticity. Astrocytic calcium events arise both spontaneously and in response to behaviour. In this study, we examined how these unitary events shape population-level calcium activity during quiescence and locomotion. Using two-photon imaging of astrocytic calcium in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice running on a freely rotating disk, we found that spontaneous fluctuations during quiescence were driven mainly by the co-occurrence of new calcium events rather than by their enlargement. During locomotion, population responses progressed through four phases: the emergence of new events, their merging into a superevent, fragmentation of this superevent, and an afterburst. New events appeared immediately at locomotion onset, indicating a rapid astrocytic response. The response also exhibited a temporal threshold of ~5 seconds: when locomotion was shorter than this, the superevent phase failed to develop, and the population response was markedly reduced. In suprathreshold responses, the superevent displayed a {Delta}F/F intensity pattern that reproduced reliably across locomotion episodes. Hotspots within this pattern had shorter latencies and were also more active during quiescence, suggesting that the response is at least partly deterministic. Consistent with this, we were able to reproduce both the response phases and the superevent pattern using a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model driven by synthetic or real locomotion inputs. Together, these findings dissect the population calcium response into quantifiable properties of unitary calcium events and reveal the formation and reproducibility of the superevent pattern, offering a potential framework for the astrocytic component of the engram.",

      "title": "Predicting stress response trajectories: Differential contributions of limbic and prefrontal regions to cortisol and affective responses",
      "content": "Why do individuals respond differently to stress? Since rodent studies indicated that stress regulation relies on limbic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) outputs, we aimed to investigate whether data from these regions could also predict cortisol and affect trajectories following psychosocial stress in humans. In this pre-registered study, 281 healthy adults (145 female) were exposed to ScanSTRESS. Repeated assessments of salivary cortisol and negative affect were used to identify response trajectories (i.e. groups of participants) using latent class mixture modelling (LCMM). LCMMs without brain predictors were compared to LCMMs including structural (volume, thickness) and functional (activation, exposure-time effect) predictors from the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC regions. Results showed that cortisol LCMMs without brain predictors exhibited a single mean trajectory. Adding brain predictors resulted in three to four response trajectories, depending on region and outcome. Within identified models, cortisol hyper-response trajectories were predicted by larger amygdala and hippocampus volumes. Cortisol non-responses were predicted by greater amygdala activation and volume. Elevated baseline cortisol was predicted by higher hippocampal activation. mPFC markers did not predict cortisol trajectories, however, medial orbitofrontal cortex parameters identified affect response profiles mirroring trait-like affect. Together, our findings suggest dissociated roles of limbic and mPFC regions in stress regulation: While limbic structures predicted cortisol responses, the mPFC shaped affective experience.",

      "title": "Deep cerebellar tFUS engages cortical circuits via convergent local and sensory-driven mechanisms",
      "content": "Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) enables non-invasive access to deep brain structures with high spatial precision, but its mechanisms of action remain elusive and under active investigation. The leading hypothesis posits that tFUS exerts its neuromodulatory effects through direct activation of neurons, while others attribute effects to indirect activation of auditory pathways. Here, we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of tFUS on the dentato-thalamo-cortical (DTC) pathway by targeting either the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) or auditory cortex (AUD) in anesthetized rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from bilateral motor cortices and the contralateral auditory cortex revealed that tFUS reliably evoked cortical potentials, whereas sham stimulation produced no responses. Both LCN and AUD stimulation activated the auditory cortex, suggesting auditory pathway involvements. However, only LCN stimulation elicited early and significant event-related potentials and gamma-band activity in the contralateral motor cortex, consistent with DTC pathway engagement. We propose that LCN-targeted stimulation engages the DTC pathway through modulation of neuronal excitability, while concurrent auditory inputs account for global cortical activation. These results are consistent with a hybrid mechanism in which tFUS modulates neuronal dynamics, converging both direct and indirect components depending on the stimulation site. Proposed framework reconciles competing views of tFUS as either a direct or indirect modulator and clarifies how ultrasound can differentially influence cortical circuits depending on the stimulation target.",
