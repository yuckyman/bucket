      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

It was blocked by upstream issues on Polars side, but those have now been resolved. Development is restarting!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars\">GeoPolars</a> is a high-performance library designed to extend the Polars DataFrame library for use with geospatial data. Written in Rust with Python bindings, it utilizes the GeoArrow specification for its internal memory model to enable efficient, multithreaded spatial processing. By leveraging the speed of Polars and the zero-copy capabilities of Arrow, GeoPolars aims to provide a significantly faster alternative to existing tools like GeoPandas, though it is currently considered a prototype.</p> <p>Development on the project is <a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars/issues/245#issuecomment-3568363838\">officially resuming</a> after a period of inactivity caused by upstream technical blockers. The project was previously stalled waiting for <a href=\"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\">Polars</a> to support &quot;Extension Types,&quot; a feature necessary to persist geometry type information and Coordinate Reference System (CRS) metadata within the DataFrames. With the Polars team now actively implementing support for these extension types, the primary hurdle has been removed, allowing the maintainers to revitalize the project and move toward a functional implementation.</p> <p>The immediate roadmap focuses on establishing a stable core architecture before expanding functionality. Short-term goals include implementing Arrow data conversion between the underlying Rust libraries, setting up basic spatial operations to prove the concept, and updating the Python bindings and documentation. The maintainers also plan to implement basic interoperability with GeoPandas, Shapely, and GDAL. Once this foundational structure is in place and data sharing is working, the project will actively seek contributors to help expand the library's suite of spatial operations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Independent Lateralization of Language, Attention, and Numerical Cognition Across Task and Rest",
      "content": "Hemispheric functional complementarity is a core organizational principle of the human brain, yet the extent to which lateralization in one domain constrains that of others remains unclear. Two main accounts have been proposed: the causal hypothesis, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the statistical hypothesis, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using multimodal fMRI in 287 participants from the BIL&amp;GIN cohort, we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition. Task-based activation was measured during line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state functional connectivity metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains. Instead, our results support a domain-specific model in which lateralization profiles are shaped by distinct developmental and functional constraints, highlighting the need for multimodal, multi-domain approaches to brain asymmetry.",
