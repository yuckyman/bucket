      "title": "Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) for spastic cerebral palsy",
      "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",

      "title": "A pilot study on simultaneous stimulation of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area using gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation to improve gait variability in post-stroke hemiparetic patients",
      "content": "IntroductionGait impairment is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. While walking speed is a key indicator of recovery, gait variability is closely associated with fall risk and long-term functional decline. Previous studies have suggested that functional interaction between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in post-stroke gait control. Rather than stimulating these regions independently, simultaneous activation of the SMA\u2014critical for rhythm modulation and motor planning\u2014and gait-synchronized stimulation of the M1\u2014essential for motor execution\u2014may offer enhanced benefits for gait stability.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a combined brain stimulation intervention targeting the SMA and M1 on gait variability and balance in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis.MethodsSixteen individuals with stroke within 180 days after the onset, aged 40\u201390 years, who were able to walk on a treadmill were recruited in this study of multi-center, randomized, controlled pilot trial with a parallel-group design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) receiving 20 min of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the SMA and gait-synchronized rhythmic stimulation to the M1 during treadmill walking, or to a control group (n = 8) receiving sham stimulation. Both groups underwent 15 sessions of walking practice over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment, retention, adherence and adverse events and preliminary estimates of effect on gait variability such as coefficient of variation for stride, stance, and swing times on the paretic side. Balance was assessed using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).ResultsAll 16 participants completed the intervention without adverse events, indicating high feasibility. The intervention group showed significantly reduced stride time variability on the paretic side and improved Mini-BESTest scores compared to the control group. A significant correlation was observed between reductions in gait variability and improvements in balance.ConclusionsThis pilot trial supports the feasibility and safety of a combined SMA and M1 stimulation approach. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in reducing gait variability and improving balance after stroke, warranting further investigation in a definitive trial.",

      "content": "AimsAlthough accumulating evidence has demonstrated the involvement of the insular cortex in autonomic regulation, the precise functional topography of insular subdivisions mediating cardiovascular control remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the role of the insula, with high anatomic precision, in regulating heart rate (HR).MethodsOverall, 487 electrical stimulations (E-stim) in patients with refractory epilepsy were used to investigate the incidence of evoked cardiac response after insula E-stim. Correlations between the parameters of E-stim, insula subdivision, and the HR shift profile were analyzed.ResultsBriefly, 40.8% of insula stimulations evoked a cardiac response. The left insula was more likely to induce cardiac responses. Compared to the electrode contacts in the declining HR group, those in the elevated HR group were predominantly distributed in the posterior insula. Notably, the middle short gyri can rapidly elicit a significant decrease in HR.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the middle short gyrus of the insula may serve as the primary cortical region mediating HR reduction. This provides new insights for the prevention and treatment of arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

      "title": "Frontal-subcortical dysfunction in toxic oil syndrome: a proof-of-concept eye-tracking and cognitive study four decades after exposure",
      "content": "IntroductionToxic Oil Syndrome (TOS) emerged in Spain in 1981 after ingestion of rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline derivatives. More than four decades later, survivors continue to report cognitive complaints, but objective evidence of long-term dysfunction remains limited.MethodsIn this case-control study, 47 TOS survivors and 44 matched healthy controls completed validated eye-tracking paradigms (visually guided, memory-guided, and antisaccade tasks) and a standardized neuropsychological battery. Groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, or education.ResultsTOS survivors showed preserved performance on visually guided and memory-guided saccades, with no group differences in latency, gain, peak velocity, or spatial error (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05). In contrast, they exhibited fewer correct antisaccades (mean 3.6 vs. 5.0; p = 0.029), more reflexive saccades (mean 7.0 vs. 5.7; p = 0.033), and increased backward reflexive saccades (mean 6.3 vs. 5.1; p = 0.040). Cognitive testing revealed selective impairments in executive function, attention, and processing speed, with preserved memory. Structural equation modeling confirmed that antisaccade impairment remained significant after adjusting for confounders and demonstrated an independent contribution of attention to correct antisaccade performance.ConclusionFindings indicate persistent frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction in TOS survivors, consistent with immune- or vascular-mediated injury patterns rather than progressive neurodegeneration. Eye-tracking provides a noninvasive biomarker of latent executive dysfunction and may be useful for long-term monitoring of populations exposed to environmental toxins.",

      "title": "Combined long nerve allograft and nerve transfer for functional recovery of ulnar nerve: case study with longitudinal clinical and neurodiagnostic follow-up",
      "content": "BackgroundPeripheral nerve injuries involving large gaps (>50 mm) are associated with poor outcomes due to delayed axonal regeneration and limited reconstructive options. While autografts are traditionally the gold standard, their use is limited by donor site morbidity and length constraints. Processed nerve allografts have emerged as an alternative, but data on their long-term efficacy, particularly for gaps \u226560 mm remain limited.Case reportWe present a case of a 15-year-old male with a 68-mm ulnar nerve gap following trauma reconstructed acutely with a processed nerve allograft. This procedure was performed in conjunction with an anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) to ulnar motor branch transfer and ulnar nerve decompression of potential entrapment sites.ResultsSerial assessments over 4.5 years demonstrated substantial recovery. By 16 months, the patient had regained strong grip strength, full range of motion, and near-normal sensory thresholds. At final follow-up, he had returned to all activities without limitations. Serial EMGs confirmed early nascent motor unit recruitment by 3 months, progressive reinnervation at 16 months, and persistent low-amplitude responses at 54 months, suggestive of ongoing but incomplete reinnervation.ConclusionThis case provides the longest known electrodiagnostic follow-up of a long-gap ulnar nerve allograft reconstruction. It supports the feasibility of processed allografts for gaps \u226470 mm and emphasizes the value of long-term EMG monitoring in tracking regeneration. These findings contribute critical data to a sparsely studied domain and help define expectations for complex nerve repairs.",

      "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
      "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",
