      "title": "Split trial analysis reveals the information capacity of neural population codes",
      "content": "Understanding how correlated neural noise affects neural population coding represents one basic question in computational and systems neuroscience. Recent theoretical work suggest that shared noise along the stimulus encoding direction is the primary factor that limits information encoding (i.e., information-limiting noise). Despite this theoretical insight, it has been difficult to test experimentally due to the challenges in inferring information-limiting noise from neural data. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a method (i.e., split-trial analysis) based on partitioning the neural population response of an individual trial. Results from extensive numerical simulations suggest that split-trial analysis substantially outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Notably, it does so without estimating the noise covariance matrix, which represents a major barrier for prior studies. Applications of split-trial analysis to a number of neurophysiological datasets reveals insights into the precision of the neural codes for several systems. First, it reveals a substantial amount of information-limiting noise in the head direction system in mice. Second, it suggests a small yet positive information-limiting noise in the orientation code in mouse V1. Third, it reveals that the information-limiting noise in the macaque prefrontal cortex is highly consistent over time during a simple saccade task. Split-trial analysis is a general technique that should be widely applicable in analyzing the properties of population codes in the brain.",

      "title": "Proteomic Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease with Psychosis Reveals Separate Molecular Signatures for Core AD Proteinopathy and Postsynaptic Density Disruption",
      "content": "Background and Hypothesis: Alzheimer's disease with psychosis (AD+P) is a subgroup of AD patients with more rapid cognitive deterioration. While our previous study showed that AD+P is associated with loss of prefrontal cortex postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, identifying proteins in the broader cellular environment that influence PSD loss addresses a critical knowledge gap about synaptic dysfunction mechanisms in early disease stages. Study Design: We conducted a proteomic analysis comparing prefrontal grey matter cortex tissue homogenates from elderly normal controls (n=18), individuals with AD+P (n=61), and individuals with AD-P (n=48), all with Braak stages 3-5. Study Results: AD+P showed the most pronounced alterations relative to controls (178 proteins with q<0.05), although alterations in AD-P and AD+P relative to controls were highly similar (R2=0.965, p<0.001). Weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified four modules significantly associated with disease status, comparing AD subjects to controls, but none differed significantly between AD+P and AD-P. We identified 15 proteins significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, including ENPP6, linked to AD+P by GWAS. Additionally, PSD yield-associated proteins showed minimal overlap with altered AD proteins (1 of 137). WGCNA revealed one module significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, enriched for inflammatory terms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a model in which AD+P arises from the combination of quantitative alterations within a shared AD proteome profile and a superimposed set of protein alterations correlated with PSD yield that are largely independent of the shared AD proteome, conferring distinct mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability and psychosis risk.",

      "title": "The developmental emergence of tonic and phasic REM sleep in rats",
      "content": "REM sleep is composed of two substates - phasic and tonic - that differ in their behavioral, sensory, and electrophysiological features. Although these substates are well characterized in adults, their developmental trajectory remains unclear. Here, we examined the development of tonic and phasic REM in rats from postnatal day (P) 12-24, spanning a period of rapid corticothalamic development. We recorded local field potentials and single units from primary motor cortex (M1), together with high-speed video and electromyographic recordings of the nuchal muscle. Periods of behavioral quiescence along with high delta power indicated NREM sleep, whereas periods of sustained muscle atonia and low delta power indicated REM sleep. At P16, M1 theta oscillations first appeared, and the delay to the first twitch increased, revealing the start of a distinct twitch-free portion of REM sleep. Motivated by this, we divided REM sleep into phasic and tonic periods, with and without twitching, respectively. Spiking activity and gamma power were consistently higher during phasic REM. At P20, phasic REM also showed faster theta oscillations than tonic REM. At P24, tonic REM was accompanied by a distinct alpha oscillation. These results show that the features distinguishing the two REM substates appear sequentially across development, revealing a progressive differentiation of REM sleep into tonic and phasic periods, a developmental refinement that may support increasingly complex forms of sleep-dependent plasticity.",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is a promising intervention for treatment-resistant depression, yet objective biomarkers that track recovery remain limited. This study examined longitudinal changes in stimulation-evoked potentials (SEPs) to characterize how SCC-driven cortical communication evolves during treatment. Ten patients across three SCC-DBS trials underwent high-density EEG recordings at 4 and 24 weeks. SEP features were extracted from source-localized SCC signals and related to clinical outcomes and fractional anisotropy (FA) of midcingulate cingulum fibers. Cortical responses showed a consistent reduction in latency and an increase in magnitude over time, indicating faster and stronger electrocortical signaling with chronic stimulation. Higher baseline midcingulate FA predicted greater latency acceleration, linking SEP timing to white-matter integrity. These findings identify temporal SEP dynamics as candidate mechanistic biomarkers that reflect circuit engagement during SCC-DBS and offer a pathway toward physiology-guided optimization of neuromodulation for depression.",
