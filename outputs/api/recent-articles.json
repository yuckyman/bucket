      "title": "A high-content imaging workflow to screen for molecules that reduce cellular uptake of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils",
      "content": "A classical pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the formation of protein-rich aggregates and inclusions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.",

      "title": "10.5 Tesla High-Resolution Macaque Brain MRI for Connectivity Studies",
      "content": "Mapping brain connectivity in primates remains a major challenge due to difficulties in resolving microscopic white matter architecture, while maintaining whole-brain coverage. Increasing imaging spatial resolution is key for disambiguating fiber configurations within smaller anatomical volumes. Here, we present developments that allow high-resolution diffusion MRI of the macaque brain, both in vivo and ex vivo, using one of the world's highest-field human MRI scanners operating at 10.5 Tesla. Our approach achieves data of highest reported resolutions for this field strength and scanner type, (750 m)3 in vivo and (400 m)3 ex vivo, with diffusion weighting up to b = 6000 s/mm2. We detail methodological advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and whole-brain tractography that overcome critical challenges associated with ultra-high-field imaging. This work establishes a new benchmark for high-resolution neuroimaging at 10.5T, paving the way for comparable human studies and enabling analyses of brain connectivity across species and tissue states at unprecedented detail. The dataset, along with all processing pipelines, containerised workflows, and reusable web services, is openly shared to support reproducibility and future integration with microscopy for studying white matter microstructure and connections at the mesoscale.",

      "content": "Discrimination is a chronic stressor linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding associations between early discrimination and the brain in childhood may help identify mechanisms through which discrimination impacts future health. Data from 4512 children (ages 9-11) and a subsample of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC; N = 1567) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) was used to create linear mixed-effects models that evaluated associations between Perceived Discrimination (PD) and amygdala resting-state fMRI connectivity (AC) to the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and thalamus. PD was measured using the youth self-reported PD Scale. Results indicated that greater PD significantly predicted greater AC to the right thalamus in our full sample. In secondary analyses, environmental and behavioral factors were evaluated as potential moderators for associations significant at least at a trend level in both our full sample and BIPOC subsample. In our BIPOC subsample, traumatic events experienced (TE) moderated the relationship between PD and AC to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; SN), such that greater TE predicted stronger positive associations between PD and this connection. Results suggest PD impacts neural connections in early life, highlighting the need to consider the impact of discrimination on risk for psychopathology.",

      "title": "PATZ1 remodels the nucleosome landscape to promote chromatin accessibility in injured neurons",
      "content": "Adult central nervous system neurons fail to regenerate after injury, in part due to epigenetic constraints that maintain a growth-restrictive chromatin state. We previously showed that the transcription factor PATZ1 reprograms chromatin accessibility in injured corticospinal neurons to promote axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we use nucleosome-resolution profiling to reveal that PATZ1 induces widespread nucleosome eviction at regeneration-associated gene loci. PATZ1 treatment dramatically reduces both nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness, indicating active chromatin remodeling rather than passive destabilization. This remodeling occurs preferentially at distal regulatory elements, where PATZ1 drives a greater than 3-fold expansion of H3K27ac-marked active enhancers. Nucleosome eviction at these sites precedes enhancer activation, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that targeted nucleosome eviction at enhancers underlies PATZ1-mediated chromatin reorganization, providing mechanistic insight into how epigenetic barriers to CNS regeneration can be overcome.",

      "content": "Senescent microglia develop during aging and Alzheimer disease (AD), driving chronic neuroinflammation. Here we hypothesized that the previously observed disease-modifying effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade occur through clearance of senescent microglia. Using CyTOF, we found that a single systemic anti-PD-L1 injection leads to rapid elimination of senescent microglia in 5xFAD and aged wild-type mice, independently of Fc effector function, while increasing homeostatic microglia. These findings suggest that immune rejuvenation via PD-L1 blockade promotes disease modification in AD through senescent-microglial elimination.",

      "title": "Open-access template and database approaches for pseudo-CT generation in brain PET/MRI attenuation correction",
      "content": "Positron emission tomography (PET) provides high-sensitivity molecular information in neuroimaging. However, its quantitative accuracy critically depends on attenuation correction (AC). Unlike PET/CT, hybrid PET/MRI systems cannot directly measure photon attenuation, necessitating alternative AC strategies. While several MRI-based AC tools exist, they often raise concerns regarding data privacy, long-term accessibility and reproducibility. We present an open-access framework for PET AC using pseudo-CT (pCT) methods. A database of 60 paired MRI-CT scans was curated and normalized to stereotactic MNI space. Three established pCT approaches (Boston, MaxProb, UCL) were adapted to enable their use with the normalized database. Method performance was assessed by comparison with a CT-based AC reference in an independent validation sample of 28 subjects, using the Jaccard index and [11C]DASB PET-derived serotonin transporter quantification as evaluation metrics. Boston and MaxProb demonstrated consistent performance across database subsets, while the UCL achieved the closest agreement with CT-derived AC and yielded the lowest quantification error (mean relative error <0.5%). This work demonstrates the feasibility of different pCT approaches using a database in MNI space thereby introducing an openly available reference database to support fast, reproducible and continued integration of MRI-based AC into PET reconstruction pipelines.",

      "content": "The human brain organizes fragmented information into internal maps that support inference of latent relational structure. Vulnerabilities in this mapping process have been hypothesized to contribute to psychosis-spectrum disorders. Whether internal maps arise as readily from visual input as from linguistic description remains unknown. Here, participants learned food items associated with two abstract attributes, presented as images or language, organized along two abstract dimensions within a two-dimensional conceptual space. Participants then completed similarity judgments and reward-learning tasks that required inference of the underlying relational structure. We show that cognitive disorganization, a hallmark of psychosis-spectrum traits, selectively impairs spatial sensitivity and reward generalization when relational structure must be inferred from visual input, but not when matched structure is provided by linguistic descriptions. These findings support the shallow cognitive map hypothesis and suggest that cognitive disorganization selectively disrupts the transformation of perceptual input into stable relational representations.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",
