      "title": "Task-Dependent Motor Unit Recruitment and Rate Coding Reveal Redistribution of Neural Drive in the Human Hand",
      "content": "Although Henneman's size principle dictates an orderly small-to-large activation, evidence suggests a certain level of flexibility in the recruitment of spinal motor neurons depending on task demands. Here, we investigate motor unit (MU) recruitment flexibility in the human first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle while controlling for overall muscle activation across two functionally distinct tasks using high-density intramuscular EMG (HD-iEMG) electrode arrays. Six participants performed isometric index finger abduction where the FDI serves as the prime mover, and flexion with the FDI functioning as a synergist. Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and recruitment orders (ROs) were highly consistent within the same task, but differed significantly between abduction and flexion. Across participants, 45.3% of MUs showed changes in recruitment above the coefficient of repeatability across tasks compared to only 5.0% within tasks. Changes in RT were accompanied by corresponding adaptations in discharge rate (DR), preserving the inverse RT-DR relationship. MU size did not have an effect on recruitment variability. Intramuscular coherence analysis revealed no differences in the delta (1-5 Hz) or alpha (5-13 Hz) band, but beta band (13-30 Hz) coherence was significantly lower during flexion than abduction, indicating reduced high-frequency inputs when FDI serves as a synergist muscle. Together, these results indicate different distributions of net excitatory input to FDI MUs across different functional tasks, that may include stronger involvement of spinal circuits during flexion as opposed to abduction, as indicated by the reduced intramuscular beta coherence. Moreover, the present findings also demonstrate that common synaptic input and not intrinsic motor neuron properties determines the inverse relation between MU RT and DR.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN,\nWe are the OpenDCAI group from Peking University. We built Paper2Any, an open-source tool designed to automate the \"Paper to Slides\" workflow based on our DataFlow-Agent framework.\nThe Problem: Writing papers is hard, but creating professional architecture diagrams and slides (PPTs) is often more tedious. Most AI tools just generate static images (PNGs) that are impossible to tweak for final publication.\nThe Solution: Paper2Any takes a PDF, text, or sketch as input, understands the research logic, and generates fully editable PPTX (PowerPoint) files and SVGs. We prioritize flexibility and fidelity\u2014allowing you to specify page ranges, switch visual styles, and preserve original assets.\nHow it works:\n1. Multimodal Reading: Extracts text and visual elements from the paper. You can now specify page ranges (e.g., Method section only) to focus the context and reduce token usage.\n2. Content Understanding: Identifies core contributions and structural logic.\n3. PPT Generation: Instead of generating one flat image, it generates independent elements (blocks, arrows, text) with selectable visual styles and organizes them into a slide layout.\nLinks:\n- Demo: <a href=\"http://dcai-paper2any.cpolar.top/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dcai-paper2any.cpolar.top/</a>\n- Code (DataFlow-Agent): <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent</a>\nWe'd love to hear your feedback on the generation quality and the agent workflow!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Pathway Anchored Multimodal Clustering Reveals Circuit Level Signatures in Parkinsons Disease",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease is increasingly understood as a disorder of distributed brain circuits, yet most imaging analyses do not explicitly respect pathway structure. We introduce a pathway anchored, multimodal clustering framework based on Scalable Robust Variational Compositional Co-clustering (SRVCC) that integrates structural MRI, free water corrected diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT in anatomically defined circuits. For each pathway, we derive a simple Multimodal Pathway Integrity Score (MPIS) that aggregates z normalised volume, microstructural, and dopaminergic measures into an interpretable summary of imaging integrity. In the PPMI cohort, SRVCC identifies stable imaging-derived patient clusters and feature modules under explicit model selection and bootstrap/stability checks, with covariate-adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, education, medication, and scanner. MPIS shows coherent but modest structure function associations: lower nigrostriatal and frontostriatal integrity relates to higher motor burden (UPDRS-III), while reduced sensory/visuospatial and limbic integrity is linked to lower global cognition (MoCA); microvascular markers robustly stratify imaging profiles but display minimal cross-sectional coupling to these global scales. Feature-level reports highlight dominant region by modality contributors (e.g., striatal DAT-SBR, thalamic and cerebellar morphology, white-matter hyperintensity metrics), providing a transparent bridge from multimodal data to circuit-level signatures. This pathway-aware representation offers a principled, reproducible way to summarise multimodal imaging in PD and may support future work on circuit-informed stratification, prognosis, and targeted outcome measures.",
