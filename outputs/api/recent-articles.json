      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "Effects of comprehensive group music therapy on affect and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia undergoing community-based rehabilitation: a preliminary study",
      "content": "Background and objectiveMost individuals with schizophrenia reside in the community, where they frequently encounter difficulties related to emotional problems and social functioning\u2013 critical areas of concern in the rehabilitation process. This study aims to investigate the effects of a comprehensive group music therapy intervention on the emotional state and social functioning of individuals with schizophrenia undergoing community rehabilitation.MethodsA total of 28 individuals with schizophrenia in community rehabilitation were randomly assigned to either the music intervention group (n = 14) or the control group (n = 14). The music intervention group participated in an 8-week comprehensive group music therapy intervention, while the control group continued with routine family life. The music therapy program was culturally adapted to the local community context, incorporating familiar regional music and dialect. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) served as the primary outcome to assess affective changes, and the Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) served as the secondary outcome to evaluate social functioning. Both measures were administered pre- and post-intervention. In addition, some participants in the intervention group completed semi-structured interviews to explore changes in social functioning and affect.ResultsFollowing the intervention, the music therapy group showed significant improvements in positive affect, social activities and self-care, as measured by the PANAS and SDSS, respectively. In contrast, no significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group. Semi-structured interviews further supported these findings, with participants in the intervention group reporting enhanced emotional state and improved social functioning.ConclusionComprehensive group music therapy appears to be an effective intervention for improving emotional states and social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia engaged in community rehabilitation. This culturally adapted intervention model demonstrates its potential for broader application.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.22809v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examined how AI-generated summaries, which have become visually prominent in online search results, affect how users think about different issues. In a preregistered randomized controlled experiment, participants (N = 2,004) viewed mock search result pages varying in the presence (vs. absence), placement (top vs. middle), and stance (benefit-framed vs. harm-framed) of AI-generated summaries across four publicly debated topics. Compared to a no-summary control group, participants exposed to AI-generated summaries reported issue attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support that aligned more closely with the AI summary stance. The summaries placed at the top of the page produced stronger shifts in users' issue attitudes (but not behavioral intentions or policy support) than those placed at the middle of the page. We also observed moderating effects from issue familiarity and general trust toward AI. In addition, users perceived the AI summaries more useful when it emphasized health harms versus benefits. These findings suggest that AI-generated search summaries can significantly shape public perceptions, raising important implications for the design and regulation of AI-integrated information ecosystems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.22789v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Novice programmers experience emotional difficulties in informal online learning environments, where confusion and frustration can hinder motivation and learning outcomes. This study investigates novice programmers' emotional experiences in informal settings, identifies the causes of emotional struggle, and explores design opportunities for affect-aware support systems. We manually annotated 1,500 posts from r/learnprogramming using the Learning-Centered Emotions framework and conducted clustering and axial coding. Confusion, curiosity, and frustration were the most common emotions, often co-occurring and associated with early learning stages. Positive emotions were relatively rare. The primary emotional triggers included ambiguous errors, unclear learning pathways, and misaligned learning resources. We identify five key areas where novice programmers need support in informal learning spaces: stress relief and resilient motivation, topic explanation and resource recommendation, strategic decision-making and learning guidance, technical support, and acknowledgment of their challenges. Our findings highlight the need for intelligent, affect-sensitive mechanisms that provide timely support aligned with learners' emotional states.",

      "title": "Epistemic Fragility in Large Language Models: Prompt Framing Systematically Modulates Misinformation Correction",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.22746v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly displace traditional expertise, their capacity to correct misinformation has become a core concern. We investigate the idea that prompt framing systematically modulates misinformation correction - something we term 'epistemic fragility'. We manipulated prompts by open-mindedness, user intent, user role, and complexity. Across ten misinformation domains, we generated 320 prompts and elicited 2,560 responses from four frontier LLMs, which were coded for strength of misinformation correction and rectification strategy use. Analyses showed that creative intent, expert role, and closed framing led to a significant reduction in correction likelihood and effectiveness of used strategy. We also found striking model differences: Gemini 2.5 Pro had 74% lower odds of strong correction than Claude Sonnet 4.5. These findings highlight epistemic fragility as an important structural property of LLMs, challenging current guardrails and underscoring the need for alignment strategies that prioritize epistemic integrity over conversational compliance.",

      "title": "A race to belief: How Evidence Accumulation shapes trust in AI and Human informants",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.22617v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into everyday decision-making has reshaped patterns of selective trust, yet the cognitive mechanisms behind context-dependent preferences for AI versus human informants remain unclear. We applied a Bayesian Hierarchical Sequential Sampling Model (HSSM) to analyze how 102 Colombian university students made trust decisions across 30 epistemic (factual) and social (interpersonal) scenarios.\n  Results show that context-dependent trust is primarily driven by differences in drift rate (v), the rate of evidence accumulation, rather than initial bias (z) or response caution (a). Epistemic scenarios produced strong negative drift rates (mean v = -1.26), indicating rapid evidence accumulation favoring AI, whereas social scenarios yielded positive drift rates (mean v = 0.70) favoring humans. Starting points were near neutral (z = 0.52), indicating minimal prior bias.\n  Drift rate showed a strong within-subject association with signed confidence (Fisher-z-averaged r = 0.736; 95 percent bootstrap CI 0.699 to 0.766; 97.8 percent of individual correlations positive, N = 93), suggesting that model-derived evidence accumulation closely mirrors participants' moment-to-moment confidence. These dynamics may help explain the fragility of AI trust: in epistemic domains, rapid but low-vigilance evidence processing may promote uncalibrated reliance on AI that collapses quickly after errors.\n  Interpreted through epistemic vigilance theory, the results indicate that domain-specific vigilance mechanisms modulate evidence accumulation. The findings inform AI governance by highlighting the need for transparency features that sustain vigilance without sacrificing efficiency, offering a mechanistic account of selective trust in human-AI collaboration.",

      "title": "MATCH: Engineering Transparent and Controllable Conversational XAI Systems through Composable Building Blocks",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.22420v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems enables them to solve an increasing number of tasks, the black-box problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models. While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. This challenge not only pertains to standard XAI techniques but also to human examination and conversational XAI approaches that need access to model internals to interpret them correctly and completely. To this end, we propose conceptually representing such interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks. These include the AI models themselves, as well as control mechanisms grounded in literature. The structural building blocks can then be explained through complementary explanatory building blocks, such as established XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP. The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an unambiguous overview of the underlying system, serving as a communication basis for both human and automated agents, thus aligning human and machine interpretability of the embedded AI models. In this paper, we present our flow-based approach and a selection of building blocks as MATCH: a framework for engineering Multi-Agent Transparent and Controllable Human-centered systems. This research contributes to the field of (conversational) XAI by facilitating the integration of interpretability into existing interactive systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.22352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AutoML systems targeting novices often prioritize algorithmic automation over usability, leaving gaps in users' understanding, trust, and end-to-end workflow support. To address these issues, we propose an abstract pipeline that covers data intake, guided configuration, training, evaluation, and inference. To examine the abstract pipeline, we report a user study where we assess trust, understandability, and UX of a prototype implementation. In a 24-participant study, all participants successfully built their own models, UEQ ratings were positive, yet experienced users reported higher trust and understanding than novices. Based on this study, we propose four design principles to improve the design of AutoML systems targeting novices: (P1) support first-model success to enhance user self-efficacy, (P2) provide explanations to help users form correct mental models and develop appropriate levels of reliance, (P3) provide abstractions and context-aware assistance to keep users in their zone of proximal development, and (P4) ensure predictability and safeguards to strengthen users' sense of control.",

      "title": "HandyLabel: Towards Post-Processing to Real-Time Annotation Using Skeleton Based Hand Gesture Recognition",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.22337v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The success of machine learning is deeply linked to the availability of high-quality training data, yet retrieving and manually labeling new data remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. Traditional annotation tools, such as Label Studio, often require post-processing, where users label data after it has been recorded. Post-processing is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially with large datasets, and may lead to erroneous annotations due to the difficulty of subjects' memory tasks when labeling cognitive activities such as emotions or comprehension levels. In this work, we introduce HandyLabel, a real-time annotation tool that leverages hand gesture recognition to map hand signs for labeling. The application enables users to customize gesture mappings through a web-based interface, allowing for real-time annotations. To ensure the performance of HandyLabel, we evaluate several hand gesture recognition models on an open-source hand sign (HaGRID) dataset, with and without skeleton-based preprocessing. We discovered that ResNet50 with preprocessed skeleton-based images performs an F1-score of 0.923. To validate the usability of HandyLabel, a user study was conducted with 46 participants. The results suggest that 88.9% of participants preferred HandyLabel over traditional annotation tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.22269v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Young people's mental well-being is a global concern, with peer support playing a key role in daily emotional regulation. Conversational agents are increasingly viewed as promising tools for delivering accessible, personalised peer support, particularly where professional counselling is limited. However, existing systems often suffer from rigid input formats, scripted responses, and limited emotional sensitivity. The emergence of large language models introduces new possibilities for generating flexible, context-aware, and empathetic responses. To explore how individuals with psychological training perceive such systems in peer support contexts, we developed an LLM-based multi-module system to drive embodied conversational agents informed by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In a user study (N=10), we qualitatively examined participants' perceptions, focusing on trust, response quality, workflow integration, and design opportunities for future mental well-being support systems.",
