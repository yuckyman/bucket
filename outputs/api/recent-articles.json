      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "content": "Objective. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activity during walking after lower-limb amputation. Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation. Approach. This case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 d. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity and knee and ankle joint angles. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early (Day 30) and late (Day 63) time points across the implant duration. Main results. During walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal. Significance. Restoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS altered muscle activity during walking led to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.
