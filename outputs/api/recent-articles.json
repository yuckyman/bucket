      "title": "Speculating a Tactile Grammar: Toward Task-Aligned Chart Design for Non-Visual Perception",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.13731v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Tactile graphics are often adapted from visual chart designs, yet many of these encodings do not translate effectively to non-visual exploration. Blind and low-vision (BLV) people employ a variety of physical strategies such as measuring lengths with fingers or scanning for texture differences to interpret tactile charts. These observations suggest an opportunity to move beyond direct visual translation and toward a tactile-first design approach. We outline a speculative tactile design framework that explores how data analysis tasks may align with tactile strategies and encoding choices. While this framework is not yet validated, it offers a lens for generating tactile-first chart designs and sets the stage for future empirical exploration. We present speculative mockups to illustrate how the Tactile Perceptual Grammar might guide the design of an accessible COVID-19 dashboard. This scenario illustrates how the grammar can guide encoding choices that better support comparison, trend detection, and proportion estimation in tactile formats. We conclude with design implications and a discussion of future validation through co-design and task-based evaluation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.13123v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As virtual reality (VR) systems become increasingly more advanced, they are likewise expected to respond intelligently and adapt to individual user states, abilities, and preferences. Recent work has explored how VR can be adapted and tailored to individual users. However, existing reviews tend to address either user-state sensing or adaptive interaction design in isolation, limiting our understanding of their combined implementation in VR. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the growing research on personalized interaction in VR, with a particular focus on utilizing participants' immersion information and adaptation mechanisms to modify virtual environments and enhance engagement, performance, or a specific goal. We synthesize findings from studies that employ adaptive techniques across diverse application domains and summarize a five-stage conceptual framework that unifies adaptive mechanisms across domains. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including the integration of multimodal sensors, an increasing reliance on user state inference, and the challenge of balancing responsiveness with transparency. We conclude by proposing future directions for developing more user-centered VR systems.",

      "title": "Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.13091v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.",

However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped: (1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a 12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195 experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making and human-centered AI.",

      "title": "Developing and Validating the Arabic Version of the Attitudes Toward Large Language Models Scale",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.13009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global, understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs. The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales, AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language. Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research and policy-making in the Arab region.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12994v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Prolonged exposure to virtual reality (VR) systems leads to visual fatigue, impairs user comfort, performance, and safety, particularly in high-stakes or long-duration applications. Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG, heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407 participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles, and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive human-computer interactions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12988v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection, achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation, where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.",

However, most current checkers evaluate static or mechanically-generated contexts, failing to capture common accessibility errors impacting mobile app functionality. We present TaskAudit, an accessibility evaluation system that focuses on detecting functiona11ity errors through simulated interactions. TaskAudit comprises three components: a Task Generator that constructs interactive tasks from app screens, a Task Executor that uses agents with a screen reader proxy to perform these tasks, and an Accessibility Analyzer that detects and reports accessibility errors by examining interaction traces. Evaluation on real-world apps shows that our strategy detects 48 functiona11ity errors from 54 app screens, compared to between 4 and 20 with existing checkers. Our analysis demonstrates common error patterns that TaskAudit can detect in addition to prior work, including label-functionality mismatch, cluttered navigation, and inappropriate feedback.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12944v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The prot\\'eg\\'ee effect suggests that individuals learn more effectively when they teach a subject. While this has shown potential for acquiring knowledge and skills, can it also support acquiring a new behaviour? This study evaluated a prot\\'eg\\'e-based intervention designed to manage digital stress. Over three weeks, 137 participants with moderate to high digital stress were assigned to four groups. Two were prot\\'eg\\'ee-based: a passive group, given material to teach, and an active group, received headlines and had to search for and prepare teaching content. Both groups completed three sessions, each focused on one digital stress component: availability demand stress, approval anxiety, and fear of missing out. A digital literacy group received similar content and quizzes, and a control group. Outcomes measured included digital stress, problematic social media use, word-of-mouth about its management, and issue involvement. Findings highlight the challenge of translating cognitive engagement into behavioural change, especially amid persistent digital habits and socially reinforced stressors. Results offer insights into the limitations of interventions based on the prot\\'eg\\'ee effect when applied to behaviour change, particularly in the context of reflective digital wellbeing strategies. Future research could explore interactive formats, such as peer engagement or self-regulatory elements, to enhance motivation and impact.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.08436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2505.12204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.",

The normative framework of a Bayesian observer model can account for this phenomenon, yet most formulations treat it as given rather than explaining its emergence through learning. We introduce a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that acquires latent representations and inference strategies directly from sensory inputs, without hand-crafted likelihoods or priors. Trained using adversarial learning with reconstruction on Gabor stimuli under varying uncertainty, the network learns to recover underlying stimuli from noisy inputs, and spontaneously reproduces the bias reversal observed in human perception. This emergent behavior arises from network responses that reveal signatures of efficient coding and Bayesian inference. Our findings provide an end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep learning.",

      "title": "Scaling Vision Transformers for Functional MRI with Flat Maps",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.13768v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/MedARC-AI/fmri-fm.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.13519v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics.\n  In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude.\n  Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.",

      "title": "Jacobian-Based Interpretation of Nonlinear Neural Encoding Model",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.13688v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, the alignment between artificial neural network (ANN) embeddings and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) via neural encoding models has significantly advanced research on neural representation mechanisms and interpretability in the brain. However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.13156v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The theta rhythm is important for many cognitive functions including spatial processing, memory encoding, and memory recall. The information processing underlying these functions is thought to rely on consistent, phase-specific spiking throughout a theta oscillation that may fluctuate significantly in baseline (center of oscillations), frequency, or amplitude. Experimental evidence shows that spikes can occur at specific phases even when the baseline membrane potential varies significantly, such that the integrity of phase-locking persists across a large variability in spike threshold. The mechanism of this precise spike timing during the theta rhythm is not yet known and previous mathematical models have not reflected the large variability in threshold potential seen experimentally. Here we introduce a straightforward mathematical neural model capable of demonstrating a phase-locked spiking in the face of significant baseline membrane potential fluctuation during theta rhythm. This novel approach incorporates a degenerate grazing bifurcation of an asymptotically stable oscillation. This model suggests a potential mechanism for how biological neurons can consistently produce spikes near the peak of a variable membrane potential oscillation.",

      "content": "Immunohistochemistry for amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptide is an indispensable method for Alzheimers disease (AD) research. Despite a wide variety of available antibodies against the peptides, the difference of immunohistochemical reactivity is not fully described among anti-A{beta} antibodies. Immunohistochemical reactivity of Abs against A{beta} peptides is critical for accurate and reliable evaluation of A{beta} burden in patients as well as models of AD. Here, we examined immunohistochemical reactivity of two mouse and one rabbit monoclonal antibodies against A{beta} N-terminal regions using two AD mouse models, AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F. 6E10, 82E1 and D54D2 A{beta} antibodies were used in this study. We found significant differences in the immunohistochemical reactivity in both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F models. While 6E10 immunoreactivity was mainly localized to A{beta} plaques, D54D2 and 82E1 antibodies stained much more broadly beyond plaques. Interestingly, the latter two Abs showed blurred filamentous immunoreactivity beyond amyloid plaque cores. Double immunostaining using a tyramide signal amplification method, Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase (FT-GO), suggested that the differential immunohistochemical outcomes were only partially attributable to their sensitivity. Moreover, heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) did not affect the differential immunohistochemical outcomes. Our analysis indicates that outcomes of A{beta} immunohistochemistry highly depends on the antibody used in the study.",

      "title": "Hippocampal grey matter changes across scales in Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by deterioration in cognitive function including extensive memory impairment. The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe region, is a key orchestrator in the encoding and retrieval of memory and is believed to be one of the first regions to deteriorate in AD. In this work we examined hippocampal macrostructure (specifically gyrification and thickness) and microstructure in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to healthy aged controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We first utilized an iterative training paradigm to adapt an existing deep learning approach for capturing hippocampal topology to elderly individuals as well as individuals with potential hippocampal degeneration. Using this new model, we found notable decreases in both thickness and gyrification in AD and MCI across both the subfields and anterior-posterior axis. Using the diffusion tensor representation derived from diffusion MRI data, we found significant increases in the mean diffusivity across the extent of the hippocampus in AD and MCI, which may be related to a number of changes such as loss of neuronal cells, decreased fiber density, demyelination, and increased presence of CSF. Examining the primary direction of diffusion relative to canonical hippocampal axes, we found distinct diffusion orientation shifts in AD and MCI throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the subiculum and CA1. Specifically, we found a decrease in diffusion oriented tangentially, and an increase in diffusion oriented along the long-axis. This could potentially be related to the known degeneration of the perforant path, which is greatly affected in AD and is a largely tangential oriented pathway. The AD-related changes in diffusion orientations were found to not have significant spatial overlap with AD-related changes in mean diffusivity, suggesting that they may be capturing distinct spatially-localized disease processes. Finally, we showed that the macro- and microstructure of the hippocampus in AD changed less across age relative to MCI and controls. As well, the age-related hippocampal macrostructure changes in MCI appeared indistinguishable from healthy aging.",

      "content": "RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) is a repressor of transcriptional initiation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Here, we show that conditional REST elevation in cerebellar granule cell progenitors (CGNPs) of RESTTG mice perturbed foliation, increased cell migration, and sustained C-X-C motif receptor 4 (Cxcr4) signaling, a pathway key to postnatal CGNP migration. Mechanistic studies uncovered a novel role for REST in controlling transcript diversity and exon skipping in CGNPs. Alternative transcript expression was detected in known Cxcr4 signaling regulator, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-6 (Grk6). Further analysis of Grk6 isoform expression revealed an upregulation of a transcript lacking exon 10a (Grk6-207) in RESTTG CGNPs. Grk6-207 expression in wildtype CGNPs hyperactivated Cxcr4 signaling and increased chemotaxis. Structural modeling of Grk6-207 predicted changes in active site conformation and interactions with Cxcr4 and {beta}-Arrestin-1, supporting impairment of Cxcr4 signaling desensitization. Interestingly, REST elevation promoted increased chromatin accessibility at the exon10a-10b junction and exon 10a exclusion. Integrated multiomic analyses identified the enhancer of zeste (Ezh2) as a potential mediator of alternative transcript generation which demonstrated increased occupancy at the exon10a-10b locus in RESTTG CGNPs. Pharmacological inhibition of Ezh2 downregulated Grk6-207, confirming a role for Ezh2 in Grk6 exon10a exclusion and the increased migration in RESTTG CGNPs.",
