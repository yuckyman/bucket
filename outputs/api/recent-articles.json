      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

Policymakers in Mexico and countries with Mexican populations should prioritize effective eye health for marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution to include eye care in universal health coverage can reach those most affected.",

While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",
