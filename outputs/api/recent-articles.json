      "title": "A semantotopic map in human hippocampus",
      "content": "The hippocampus plays a central role in encoding abstract conceptual and semantic information. However, little is known about the topography of that encoding. We leveraged the rare opportunity to examine neural responses densely along a small portion of the human hippocampus, specifically, the mediolateral axis of the anterior body. We collected responses to passive language listening using Neuropixels probes in three anesthetized patients during clinically indicated neurosurgical procedures. We computed semantic tuning functions for each recording site by regressing threshold crossing events and single unit responses against semantic embeddings from GPT-2, Word2Vec, and SBERT. We find that tuning functions of more distant recording sites are more dissimilar, supporting the hypothesis semantotopic organization. Multiple semantic features showed systematic changes along that axis, including animacy, concreteness, and familiarity; notably, effects were individual-specific. Surprisingly, we also found a small but significant increase in semantic similarity as a function of distance between recording sites, on a shorter spatial scale, suggesting a modest periodic organization. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of a multiscale functional organization of semantics in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "content": "Dual-band photodetectors (PDs) capable of selectively responding to both visible and near-infrared (NIR) light are essential for applications in optical communication, medical diagnostics, and artificial vision systems. In this work, we report a high-performance visible/NIR dual-band PD based on a vertically stacked perovskite/organic hybrid structure. To overcome the challenges of high operating voltage and slow response, often stemming from high exciton binding energy and limited charge...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Despite national guidelines, GP-led DR screening uptake remains low, with substantial geographic, demographic and temporal disparities in Australian general practice settings. Addressing systemic barriers, strengthening GP-led screening, and implementing targeted interventions are crucial for improving DR screening uptake in Australia. The inability to calculate per-capita screening among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations due to data limitations restricts equity...",

We report the case of a 32-year-old male who developed bilateral SCH after an uneventful L4-L5 lumbar endoscopic discectomy performed under general anesthesia. The patient had a history of well-controlled hypertension and was not on anticoagulant therapy. The surgery lasted approximately 50 minutes, with appropriate head protection...",

A 59-year-old man presented with rectal bleeding and altered bowel habits, along with long-standing low blood pressure and erectile dysfunction. Investigations confirmed rectal GHT, initially managed conservatively, followed by mucosectomy, which improved his gastrointestinal symptoms. However, persistent dizziness, blurred vision, and urinary symptoms prompted neurological evaluation,...",
