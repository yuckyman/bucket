      "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
      "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "title": "Lower Bound Estimates for Electrophysiological Power Dissipation in Human Gray Matter",
      "content": "The human brain is popularly described as remarkably energy efficient, with its metabolic power consumption estimated at approximately 20 watts (W). Biophysical models have partitioned this power budget across distinct cellular processes, but these theoretical estimates have yet to be empirically constrained using whole-brain electrophysiological data. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging of resting-state human brain activity to derive empirical lower-bound estimates of electrical power dissipation in cortical gray matter. We found that the total power dissipated by currents, primarily associated with post-synaptic potentials, ranges between 10-9 and 10-10 W, several orders of magnitude lower than prevailing metabolic estimates. Using finite element modeling (FEM), we observed that electrophysiological power dissipation is predominantly confined to gray matter. Additionally, spatial variations in MEG-derived power dissipation partially correlated with regional oxygen metabolism measured by PET, yet notable discrepancies emerged across large-scale functional brain networks. These results underscore a critical divergence between electrophysiological and metabolic indices of brain energy use, and highlight the need for more integrated biophysical models to bridge this gap and better characterize the physiological underpinnings of regional brain energetics.",

      "title": "Retrograde mitochondrial transport regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in zebrafish neurons",
      "content": "To maintain a healthy mitochondrial population in a long-lived cell like a neuron, mitochondria must be continuously replenished through the process of mitochondrial biogenesis. Because the majority of mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded, mitochondrial biogenesis requires nuclear sensing of mitochondrial population health and function. This can be a challenge in a large, compartmentalized cell like a neuron in which a large portion of the mitochondrial population is in neuronal compartments far from the nucleus. Using in vivo assessments of mitochondrial biogenesis in zebrafish neurons, we determined that mitochondrial transport between distal axonal compartments and the cell body is required for sustained mitochondrial biogenesis. Estrogen-related receptor transcriptional activation links transport with mitochondrial gene expression. Together, our data support a role for retrograde feedback between axonal mitochondria and the nucleus for regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons.",

      "title": "Analyzing Gaze and Hand Movement Patterns in Leader-Follower Interactions During a Time-Continuous Cooperative Manipulation Task",
      "content": "In daily life, people often interact by taking on leader and follower roles. Unlike laboratory experiments, these interactions unfold naturally and continuously. Although it is well established that gaze typically precedes object manipulation, much less is known about how gaze-hand patterns evolve in interactive settings where one person must take the other's actions into account. Here we examine predictive, planning-related behavior in a two-player tabletop game called \"do-undo\". Participants alternated as Leader and Follower. The Leader performed simple pick-and-place actions to alter the arrangement of objects, while the Follower used other objects to restore the previous configuration. We recorded eye and hand movements, along with object trajectories, using a system that combined eye tracking with multi-camera motion capture. Touch sensors on the players' hands provided precise timing of contacts, allowing us to segment cooperative action into well-defined temporal intervals. As expected, eye fixations consistently preceded manipulation, but clear role differences emerged. Leaders looked more often and earlier at target objects. In many trials, their gaze anticipated not only their own actions but also those required of the Follower. Leaders also more frequently checked the outcome of the do-undo sequence. Both roles showed gaze patterns consistent with memorization, but alternating gazes between objects and destinations were much more common in Leaders. Some patterns suggested longer-term planning beyond the immediate action. These findings reveal distinct decision-making and planning strategies in Leaders and Followers. Leaders consider not only their own next moves but also the potential actions of their partners, shedding light on the complex cognitive processes that underly everyday human interaction.",

      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",
