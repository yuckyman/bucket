      "title": "Sex-specific regulation of social play in juvenile rats by oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus and oxytocin signaling in the nucleus accumbens",
      "content": "Social play is a rewarding behavior shown across juvenile mammalian species and is important for the development of social competency throughout the lifespan. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) regulates various social behaviors and is being used in clinical trials to improve social competency. However, the role of OXT in juvenile social play is largely unknown. To address this gap, we determined the involvement of hypothalamic OXT-producing neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), PVNOXT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and OXT signaling within the NAc, in the regulation of social play in juvenile male and female rats. We found that neither chemogenetic stimulation of SONOXT cell bodies nor PVNOXT projections to the NAc altered the expression of juvenile social play but instead increased social investigation. However, chemogenetic stimulation of PVNOXT cell bodies as well as intra-NAc infusion of OXT decreased social play in males without an effect in females. Lastly, social play duration correlated negatively with the proportion of activated NAcOXTR neurons, an effect driven by males. Together, these findings suggest that distinct OXT neuronal populations modulate different forms of social behavior and that PVNOXT neurons and NAc-OXT signaling sex-specifically modulate social play behavior.",

      "title": "Modelling Auditory Enhancement: Efferent Control of Cochlear Gain can Explain Level Dependence and Effects of Hearing Loss",
      "content": "The role of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent gain control in auditory enhancement (AE) was investigated using a subcortical auditory model. AE refers to the influence of a precursor on detectability of targets. The absence (or presence) of a precursor component at the target frequency enhances (or suppresses) detection under simultaneous masking conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced target under simultaneous masking acts as a stronger forward masker for a delayed probe tone, known as AE under forward masking. Psychoacoustic studies of AE report findings that challenge conventional expectations, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, listeners with hearing impairment have AE under simultaneous masking but not forward masking (Kreft et al., 2018; Kreft and Oxenham, 2019), whereas listeners with normal hearing have level-dependent AE under forward masking (Kreft and Oxenham, 2019). Our model with MOC efferent gain control successfully replicated these findings. In contrast, a model without efferent gain control failed to capture these effects, supporting the hypothesis that MOC-mediated cochlear gain modulation may play a role in AE and its alteration by hearing loss.",

      "title": "Topological basal ganglia model with dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity reproduces reinforcement learning, discriminatory learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are central to action selection and reinforcement learning, yet how the topological organization of the BG circuit with dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors shape learning remains unclear. We present a topologically organized spiking model of macaque BG with cortico-striatal inputs organized into competing channels, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), three-factor DA modulated STDP for cortical synapses, asymmetric intra-striatal collaterals, and partially overlapping direct/indirect pathways. We validate resting activity and action selection, then study conditioning and generalization discrimination learning using DA bursts (CS+) and dips (CS). Two structural determinants emerged. First, pathway overlap ({lambda} ) trades off selection efficiency and learning speed: higher overlap degrades GPi-based selection efficiency during conditioning, yet accelerates convergence during discrimination by strengthening D2 influence on GPi. Second, lateral inhibition from MSN-D2 to MSNs ({kappa}) helps constrain competing actions but is not sufficient alone; robust discrimination requires DA dip dependent up modulation of D2 collateral efficacy (), which speeds and, at low overlap, enables convergence. Simulations under Parkinsonian and schizophrenia-like settings showed different deficits. A hypodopaminergic Parkinsonian STDP regime (D1 LTP loss, D2 LTD loss) impaired conditioning and failed to enhance discrimination. In contrast, attenuated D2 plasticity during DA dips (modeling methamphetamine-induced changes/schizophrenia-related dysregulation) selectively disrupted discrimination while sparing conditioning. Finally, we demonstrate efficient scaling on the Fugaku supercomputer to rodent and non human primate relevant sizes, supporting large scale, biologically grounded BG simulations. Together, the results highlight how pathway overlap and D2 collateral dynamics jointly regulate the speed and reliability of discrimination learning, and how specific DA perturbations map to distinct learning impairments.",

      "title": "Early life adversity increases striatal dopamine D1 receptor density and promotes social alcohol drinking in mice, especially males",
      "content": "The brain's reward circuitry remains sensitive to experience throughout early life and into adulthood, allowing individuals to adapt to their unique environments. Adverse experiences early in life can increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, likely through alterations to this circuitry. Yet, the precise neurobiological mechanisms by which early life adversity acts are incompletely characterized. In this study, we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm as a translationally relevant model of early life adversity in isogenic C57BL/6J mice. After LBN-rearing, we assessed the lasting behavioral and neurobiological impacts of this experience in adulthood. In robust sample sizes, our results validated previous findings of increased risk avoidance, enhanced acute response to alcohol, and greater voluntary alcohol drinking in socially-housed LBN-reared mice, especially males. Further, using autoradiography, we found LBN-reared mice had increased striatal D1-like receptor binding, skewing D1- to D2-like receptor balance relative to cross-fostered controls. However, after voluntary alcohol drinking, we found a strong downregulation in D1-like, and some D2-like, receptor binding, negating pre-existing differences in striatal dopamine receptor binding. We posit that via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, LBN-rearing upregulates striatal D1-receptor density and alters risk avoidance and acute alcohol stimulation to promote alcohol drinking among adversity-exposed mice. Together, these findings reveal specific neurobiological mechanisms that promote alcohol consumption following early life adversity and suggest complex interactions between early life adversity, sex-related factors, and dopamine receptor regulation in contributing to alcohol use disorder (AUD) vulnerability.",

      "content": "Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and APOE4 represent two of the strongest pathological and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these co-pathogens interact during preclinical stages remains undefined. To address this, we developed a humanized knock-in mouse model expressing physiological, endogenously regulated human A{beta} and APOE4. Aged AppNL-F:APOE4 mice displayed incipient amyloidosis with subtle memory-related changes, consistent with preclinical AD. We found largely distinct, non-overlapping APOE4- and A{beta}-driven effects on synaptic function, sleep architecture, and exploratory behavior. However, at the transcriptomic level, APOE4 x A{beta} had a pronounced interaction in neuronal populations, whereas glial populations were primarily affected by either genotype alone. Within neurons, APOE4 x A{beta} interactions converged on a lysosomal-ER proteostasis axis across both excitatory and inhibitory cell types. These findings suggest that APOE4 x A{beta} interaction generates an early neuronal vulnerability signature that precedes overt functional decline. The AppNL-F:APOE4 knock-in model provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying early pathogenic mechanisms in AD.",

It would be awesome to get some other users to check it out and provide critical feedback to improve the tool for the open source community to make simple and elegant resumes without having to pay for it through a resume generation site.</p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>This is a CLI tool which allows for defining resume content in a single YAML file and then generating PDF, HTML, or LaTeX rendered resumes from it. The idea is to write the configuration once, then be able to render it in a variety of different iterations.</p> <p>Target Audience:</p> <p>Jobseekers, students, academia</p> <p>Comparison:</p> <p>pyresume generates latex, has not been updated in 8 years</p> <p>resume-parser appears to be out of date as well, 5 years since most recent update</p> <p>resume-markdown has been recently updated and closely matches the goals of this project; there are some differentiators between resume-markdown and this project from a ease of use perspective where the default CSS/HTML doesn't require much modification to output a nice looking resume out of the box. I'd like to support more default style themes to expand upon this.</p> <p>Some key details:</p> <p>It comes with a few templates and color schemes that you can customize.</p> <p>For academic use, the LaTeX output gives you precise typesetting control.</p> <p>There's a Python API if you want to generate resumes programmatically. It's designed to have a limited surface area to not expose inner workings, only the necessary structures as building blocks.</p> <p>The codebase has over 90% test coverage and is fully type-hinted.

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "title": "Targeting the parietal memory network with tDCS in MCI: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. In that context, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Furthermore, alterations in parietal memory network (PMN) integrity and default mode network (DMN) also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that might interfere with cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson\u2019s disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC or LPC separately.MethodsThis is a randomized and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS in 120 patients (60 aMCI and 60 PD-MCI). Firstly, all patients will be randomly (1:1) divided into two groups: DLPFC (30 aMCI; 30 PD-MCI) and LPC (30 aMCI, 30 PD-MCI) for tDCS stimulation. Secondly, they will classify randomly (2:1) real and sham groups for tDCS applied to once a day for 10 days over 2 weeks. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2-mA current frequency and will last 20\u202fmin. The primary outcome assessment for this study will be the change in score from baseline to the end of (14-days and 90\u202fdays follow-up) the tDCS application for the neurocognitive tests. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the neural underpinnings and pro-cognitive outcomes of tDCS.
