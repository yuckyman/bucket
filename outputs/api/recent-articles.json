      "title": "Impaired touch sensation on hairy skin in HCN3-deficient mice",
      "content": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel HCN3 is expressed in sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, but its contribution to somatosensory processing remains poorly understood. Here, using RNA in situ hybridization, we found that Hcn3 is widely expressed in various populations of DRG neurons. Analysis of HCN3-deficient mice in a series of behavioral tests for somatosensory function revealed that HCN3 deletion led to profound impairments in mechanical sensation on hairy skin. However, the mechanical sensation on glabrous skin and responses to noxious heat and cold stimuli were not affected in the absence of HCN3. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that deletion of HCN3 reduced the HCN current (Ih) density and affected the action potential kinetics in thoracic (Th9\u2013Th10) DRG neurons, which innervate hairy skin. However, electrophysiological parameters were unaltered in lumbar (L4\u2013L5) DRG neurons. These findings suggest that HCN3 channels are specific regulators of low-threshold mechanoreceptors that innervate hairy skin.",

      "content": "The spinal cord integrates diverse somatosensory inputs and executes motor outputs through anatomically and functionally distinct circuits. Here, we employed spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the adult mouse spinal cord to gain insights into the organizational logic of the spinal cord. Our results reveal distinct spatial and laminar distributions of neuronal subtypes, including axial level and sex-specific differences. Many neuronal subtypes exhibit close spatial proximity, implicating regionally specific patterns of connectivity and circuit functions. Additionally, neuronal subtypes within the dorsal horn exhibit a wide range of predicted cell-cell communication motifs, as assessed by the spatial distribution of neuropeptide- and other ligand-receptor pairs. Finally, we identified several neuronal subtypes with altered transcriptomic and predicted cell-cell communications in a model of neuropathic pain. This spatially resolved cellular and molecular map of the spinal cord will facilitate the decoding of circuit mechanisms underlying somatosensory and motor functions in health and disease.",

      "title": "Hypothalamic CYP46A1 cholesterol metabolism regulates diet-induced obesity",
      "content": "Obesity is a growing global health challenge that affects over 38% of the population and increases the risk of developing metabolic disorders. Effective long-term treatment options remain limited and often lead to significant side effects. The hypothalamus plays a central role in metabolic regulation by integrating peripheral and central signals to maintain energy homeostasis. While the hypothalamus regulates peripheral lipid metabolism, the role of lipid metabolic pathways within the hypothalamus itself remains unclear. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms linking hypothalamic activity to the development of obesity remain poorly understood. Given that cholesterol is the most abundant brain lipid, we investigated molecular players involved in its local regulation. Here , we identify the rate-limiting enzyme for brain cholesterol degradation, Cyp46a1, as a critical regulator of diet-induced obesity. We show that Cyp46a1 expression is significantly reduced in the hypothalamus of C57BL/6J mice exposed to a high-fat diet, suggesting a role in metabolic dysregulation. We used recombinant Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAV) to modulate Cyp46a1 expression in the arcuate nucleus, a key hypothalamic region regulating energy balance. We evaluated longitudinal changes in body weight, adipocyte size, PPAR-{gamma} expression, and hepatic lipid accumulation and pancreatic histopathology in mice undergoing chow or high fat diets. These experiments demonstrated that hypothalamic Cyp46a1 regulates body weight, adipocyte size, and hepatic and pancreatic histopathology. Conversely, CYP46A1 overexpression protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, likely via crosstalk with hepatic and pancreatic function. Moreover, we found that hypothalamic CYP46A1 expression selectively modulates gut microbiota composition, linking this enzyme to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Finally, we found that Cyp46a1 levels influence cognitive and motor performance, suggesting broader physiological relevance . Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of hypothalamic Cyp46a1 and cholesterol pathway control in obesity pathophysiology and metabolic homeostasis. These findings identify hypothalamic Cyp46a1 as a promising therapeutic target for obesity and its related comorbidities.",

      "title": "Predictability of Sleep Slow Oscillation Emergence and Spatial Extent from Pre-Onset Neural Dynamics",
      "content": "Slow oscillations (SOs; ~0.5-1.5 Hz) are a hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are known to support memory consolidation and large-scale cortical communication. Although their instantaneous dynamics are well characterized, the neural processes that precede SO initiation, and whether they predict the spatial extent of the upcoming event, remain largely unknown, despite their potential utility for anticipatory closed-loop intervention. Using high-density EEG from 29 healthy adults, we examined neural activity in the 2 s interval preceding the SO trough. Analyses focused on distinct SO subtypes defined by their spatiotemporal properties: Global, Frontal, and Local. We specifically focused on Global and Frontal events, both of which originate frontally but differ in their propagation. We quantified instantaneous spectral power, time-frequency dynamics, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and amplitude-amplitude coupling. Across all analyses, theta-band power (4-8 Hz) emerged as the earliest and most robust predictor of SO initiation, remaining informative after restricting analyses to temporally isolated SOs to reduce potential residual aftereffect confounds from preceding SOs. Theta power exhibited a sustained rise beginning nearly two seconds before the SO trough (~1.6 s before onset). Theta power increases were absent in surrogate epochs and reliably differentiated Global from Frontal SOs with moderate-to-strong effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.45-0.77), demonstrating the robustness of theta power as a physiological signature. Mechanistically, Global SOs were preceded by enhanced delta-theta PAC and broad low-frequency synchronization, whereas Frontal SOs were preceded by elevated theta/alpha-to-beta/low-gamma coupling, reflecting a state of locally enhanced coupling at frequencies higher than the SO range, which appears to restrict propagation. A simple logistic regression classifier using only pre-onset theta power achieved >95% accuracy in distinguishing SOs from surrogate events and differentiated Global from Frontal SOs with ~83% multiclass accuracy, showing further sensitivity improvements when delta power was included. These findings demonstrate that isolated SOs are preceded by structured network dynamics that are tied to their spatial extent. Thus, theta activity can be used to predict SO occurrence and might be leveraged in closed-loop neuromodulation.",

      "title": "Neuronal age drives \u03b2-sheet accumulation and, together with ApoE4, enhances synaptic A\u03b2 localization in APPNL-F neurons",
      "content": "Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and aggregation are defining features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the earliest cellular events driving these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate A{beta} dynamics in primary neurons derived from APPNL-F knock-in mice, which express human APP and A{beta} at endogenous (non-overexpressed) levels. Using correlative optical photothermal infrared (OPTIR) spectromicroscopy and immunofluorescence, we show that physiological APPNL-F expression is sufficient to drive intraneuronal A{beta} accumulation at synapses. Modelling neuronal aging through prolonged culture reveals a marked increase in synaptic A{beta} burden accompanied by {beta}-sheet-rich structural transitions Supplementation with astrocyte-derived apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms demonstrates that ApoE4 markedly increases synaptic A{beta} accumulation while reducing {beta}-sheet content relative to untreated cultures, suggesting a potential shift toward less fibrillar species. Together, these findings establish APPNL-F neurons as a physiologically relevant system for dissecting early A{beta} pathology and show that both {beta} quantity (accumulation) and quality (structural maturation) are regulated by aging and ApoE genotype. This work provides mechanistic insight into the earliest molecular events that may underlie synaptic vulnerability in AD.",

      "title": "Age-Related Upregulation and Strong Expression Correlation of the Proinflammatory Cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 Across Multiple Segments of the Mouse Eye",
      "content": "Emerging evidence suggests that ocular inflammation increases with age and is associated with various disease states. That said, the majority of studies suffer from a significant limitation; they only focus on a single segment of the eye. This represents a limitation because age-related increases in neuroinflammatory markers are not necessarily uniform within an organ, and other age-related changes in the eye are known to occur in a segment-specific manner. The present study aims to address this gap by comparting/contrasting age-related changes in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta; across multiple mouse ocular segments: the (i) anterior segment (i.e., cornea, ciliary body and muscle, and zonules), (ii) retina, and (iii) posterior segment (i.e., sclera, choroid, Bruchs membrane, retinal pigmented epithelium, and parts of the optic nerve). IL-6 and IL-1beta; were selected as targets since they exhibit differential regional patterns of age-related increases within the brain. Eyes were collected on postnatal days (P) P28, P56, P98, P200 and P500 and processed by Western blot. Both IL-6 and IL-1beta; protein levels increased across the lifespan in all three eye segments. Interestingly, correlational analyses revealed that IL-1beta; and IL-6 expression correlated with each other not only within individual eye segments, but also across segments. In old mice, IL-1beta; and IL-6 levels also correlated with expression of phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), an enzyme known to regulate neuroinflammation. Together, these findings suggest that inflammaging in the eye is broadly controlled by a systemic governor, unlike the brain that shows region-specific changes in cytokines with age.",
