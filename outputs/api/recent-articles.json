      "title": "Spontaneous thought orientation tracked by fMRI networks and EEG alpha power dynamics",
      "content": "Understanding how spontaneous, rather than experimentally induced, thoughts relate to brain activity remains a major challenge. We combined simultaneous fMRI and EEG recordings with Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES) to link momentary, naturally occurring experiences to their neural signatures during rest. Using machine-learning classification of 240 time-locked samples from eight participants, each completing nine 25-minute resting-state sessions, we reliably distinguished internally oriented from externally oriented experiences (fMRI accuracy = 65.4%, EEG = 62.5%). Externally oriented states showed greater fMRI activity in salience, auditory, and visuospatial networks and lower occipital alpha power in EEG, whereas internally oriented states exhibited the opposite pattern, extending prior DMN-focused accounts of internally directed states. Across modalities, integrated resting-state alpha power correlated negatively with BOLD fluctuations in parietal and occipital regions. These multimodal findings reveal distinct neural signatures of spontaneous experience and demonstrate that coordinated large-scale network dynamics and alpha-band oscillations track the natural alternation between inward and outward focus in the human mind.",

      "title": "Neural heterogeneity shapes the temporal structure of human working memory",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) enables temporary retention of information essential for flexible cognition. Although persistent population activity has long been regarded as a principal mechanism of memory maintenance, continuous single-neuron firing is energetically demanding and difficult to reconcile with the heterogeneous firing properties of cortical neurons. Applying single-trial analyses to 902 neurons recorded from 21 neurosurgical patients performing a WM task, we found that maintenance was supported by transient, burst-like episodes of coordinated activity rather than sustained firing. Cross-temporal decoding exhibited localized generalization, and decoding accuracy increased with wider temporal windows, indicating that apparent persistence can emerge from temporally interleaved activity across neurons. We further developed a feature-based, putative cell-type classifier that revealed distinct circuit contributions: pyramidal neurons expressed content in burst-aligned events during maintenance, whereas interneurons were strongly modulated by memory load and behavior. Together, these findings reconcile dynamic and persistent accounts, indicating that human WM can emerge from temporally interleaved, cell-type-specific dynamics that provide a flexible and potentially metabolically efficient substrate for maintaining information over time.",

      "title": "Neuronal SET1/COMPASS-mediated epigenetic regulation of de novo transcription drives accelerated forgetting with age",
      "content": "Forgetting is a critical component of memory, but its molecular regulation - particularly with age - is not well understood. Epigenetic modifications are a candidate for this regulation and may further drive age-related behavioral decline, as they are dramatically altered in the aging brain. We found that multiple components of the SET1/COMPASS complex, a conserved histone methyltransferase complex associated with active gene transcription, are upregulated with age in the C. elegans nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of the SET1/COMPASS components improves memory in young adult animals and slows memory decline in old animals. By pharmacological and genetic inhibition, optogenetics, and neuronal mRNA and chromatin profiling, we demonstrate that SET1/COMPASS-mediated active transcription promotes forgetting. SET1/COMPASS regulates the de novo activity-dependent transcription and release of a neuropeptidergic signal from the AWC olfactory sensory neuron, which erases the associative memory trace in downstream motor neurons, resulting in forgetting. We further found that increased SET1/COMPASS-dependent chromatin accessibility at these gene loci with age primes these loci for transcription, resulting in accelerated forgetting. Our results reveal the role of active gene transcription in the regulation of forgetting and altered SET1/COMPASS- mediated gene transcription as a mechanism of cognitive decline, implicating increased expression of COMPASS components as a driver of increased forgetting in the aging brain. This mechanism may offer a new target for slowing loss of cognitive function with age.",

      "title": "ZMYND11 Restrains KMT2A to Enable a Neuronal Developmental Program",
      "content": "Mutations in the chromatin reader and tumor suppressor ZMYND11 are the cause of ZMYND11-related syndromic intellectual disability (ZRSID), a disorder characterized by symptoms such as language and motor delay, behavioral disruptions, and seizures. We find that neuronal deletion of ZMYND11 in mice causes aberrant upregulation of non-neuronal gene programs, leading to reduced dendritic branching and spine density, as well as hyperactivity and abnormal motor behavior. We investigated the mechanism by which ZMYND11 regulates gene expression and discovered that ZMYND11 interacts with and inhibits the histone methyltransferase KMT2A (MLL1), a transcriptional co-activator which contributes to oncogenic and developmental gene programs. We find that a ZRSID-associated ZMYND11 point mutation abrogates ZMYND11 interaction with KMT2A, suggesting that this interaction is critical for the function of ZMYND11 in regulating brain development. Using a degron-tagged ZMYND11 mouse model to enable the rapid degradation of ZMYND11 in primary cortical neurons, we show that gene expression changes induced by ZMYND11 loss are attenuated by treatment with the KMT2A inhibitor revumenib, a drug which has recently been approved for the treatment of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our findings shed light on the convergence of chromatin mechanisms regulating neuronal gene expression and raise the possibility that modulation of KMT2A activity may be a useful therapeutic avenue for ZRSID.",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
