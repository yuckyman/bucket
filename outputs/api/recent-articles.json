      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection through mammography significantly improves outcomes, with breast density acting as both a risk factor and a key interpretive feature. Although the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) provides standardized density categories, assessments are often subjective and variable. While automated tools exist, most are proprietary and resource-intensive, limiting their use in underserved...",
