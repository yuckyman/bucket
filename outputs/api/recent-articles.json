      "title": "The fluctuations of alpha power: bimodalities, connectivity, and neural mass models",
      "content": "The alpha rhythm is a hallmark of electrophysiological resting-state brain activity, that serves as a biomarker in health and disease. Alpha power is far from uniform over time, exhibiting dynamic fluctuations. The likelihood of those power values can be captured by a decreasing exponential function, that in certain cases becomes bimodal. While alpha rhythm is usually evaluated through the averaged power spectra across entire recordings, its dynamic fluctuations have received less attention. In this study, we investigate the dynamic nature of alpha power, its relationship with functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), and the ability of the Jansen-Rit (JR) neural mass model to replicate these fluctuations. Using MRI and MEG data from 42 participants in resting state with eyes-closed and eyes-open, we evaluated the shape of the exponential distributions for alpha power fluctuations, and their relationship with other spectral variables as frequency, power and the aperiodic exponent. Additionally, we assessed the temporal relationship between alpha power and FC using phase-based (ciPLV) and amplitude-based (cAEC) metrics. Finally, we employed diffusion-weighted MRI to construct brain network models incorporating JR neural masses to reproduce and characterize alpha fluctuations. Our results indicate that alpha power predominantly follows unimodal exponential distributions, with bimodalities associated to high-power in posterior regions. FC analyses revealed that ciPLV and cAEC were directly correlated with alpha power within the DMN in alpha and beta bands, whereas only theta-band ciPLV showed an inverse relationship with alpha power. JR model simulations suggested that post- supercritical fixed points better replicated alpha power fluctuations compared to limit cycle parameterizations and pre- saddle node fixed points. These results deepen our understanding of the dynamics of alpha rhythm and its intricate relationship with FC patterns, offering novel insights to refine biologically plausible brain simulations and advance computational models of neural dynamics.",

      "title": "SSAO-mediated decrease of endothelial BDNF release affects neuronal GluA1 and PSD95 expression: a peripheral mechanism inducing NVU and CNS disturbances",
      "content": "Dysfunction of the vascular system contributes to brain damage and neurodegeneration, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) can be identified in a high percentage of Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations can affect communication and signalling between neurovascular unit (NVU) components through changes in the release of angioneurins, among others. The two-hit vascular hypothesis of AD suggests that chronic vascular risk factors cause an early damage to the brain microvasculature (hit 1) triggering a cascade of events that leads to amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation in the brain and precipitating the A\u03b2-dependent pathway of neurodegeneration (hit 2). The vascular enzyme and adhesion molecule SSAO/VAP-1 plays an important role in cerebrovascular dysfunction and vascular A\u03b2 aggregation, acting as an active player in the first of the two-hits. We generated a new NVU in vitro model to study the role of SSAO/VAP-1 on the BBB dysfunction and its effects on neurons in an AD context. We focused on the release of key angioneurins for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, highly compromised in AD. Our results show that SSAO/VAP-1 expression, together with the addition of A\u03b21-40peptide containing the Dutch mutation (used to mimic CAA condition; A\u03b2D), to cerebral endothelial cells synergistically alter the release of vascular BDNF. This alteration subsequently affects the expression of synaptic markers PSD95 and GluA1 in cortical neurons. Moreover, GluA1 and PSD95-positive neurons present reduced immunolabeling intensity of these markers when low levels of vascular BDNF are present. These results reveal vascular BDNF as a possible key element in the sensitization to A\u03b2 due to SSAO/VAP-1 expression, impacting negatively on glutamatergic synaptic and NVU function.HighlightsSSAO/VAP-1 expression alters BBB decreasing ZO-1, VE-Cadherin and Claudin-5 levels.SSAO/VAP-1 expression alters the release of vascular angioneurin BDNF.SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D decrease synaptic protein levels affecting glutamatergic neurons.Endothelial BDNF decrease induced by SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D alters glutamatergic neurons.",

      "title": "Acetaminophen inhibits diacylglycerol lipase synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol: implications for nociception",
      "content": "SUMMARYThough acetaminophen is a ubiquitous analgesic, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Thus, even though acetaminophen causes \u223c500 deaths each year in the US it has not been possible to design safer alternatives. Because endocannabinoids may have a role in acetaminophen action, we examined interactions between the two. We now report that acetaminophen inhibits the activity of diacylglycerol lipase \u03b1 (DAGL\u03b1), but not DAGL\u03b2, decreasing production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. This gave rise to the counterintuitive hypothesis that decreasing endocannabinoid production by DAGL\u03b1inhibitionmay be antinociceptive in certain settings. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that DAGL inhibition by RHC80267 is antinociceptive in wildtype but not CB1 knockout mice in the hotplate test. We propose 1) that activation of DAGL\u03b1 may exacerbate some forms of nociception and 2) a novel mechanism for the antinociceptive actions of acetaminophen whereby acetaminophen inhibits a DAGL\u03b1/CB1-based circuit that plays a permissive role in at least one form of nociception.",

      "title": "Predictive processing in the cortical network of biological motion perception: An fMRI-DCM study",
      "content": "Biological motion perception (BMP) is fundamental for interpreting and predicting human actions, playing a crucial role in social cognition. While traditionally viewed as a bottom-up process, recent evidence suggests that top-down mechanisms, particularly expectations, influence BMP. This fMRI study investigates how prior expectations shape BMP by employing a predictive cueing paradigm. Participants discriminated between biological and scrambled motion while presented with congruent, incongruent, or uninformative cues. Behavioral results revealed that correct expectations facilitated performance, while incorrect expectations impaired it. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) analysis demonstrated bidirectional connectivity within the action observation network (AON), particularly between the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) under all expectation conditions. Additionally, Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) confirmed the involvement of these regions in BMP. These findings challenge traditional bottom-up models by highlighting the role of predictive processes in action perception and provide evidence for expectation-dependent modulation of AON connectivity.",

      "content": "BackgroundExercise has been revealed to leave a positive effect on alleviating depressive symptoms by various existing studies. However, the neural basis behind this phenomenon remains unknown, as well as its underlying biological mechanism.AimsUsing a large neuroimaging cohort from UK Biobank, this study aimed to identify structural connectivity (SC) patterns simultaneously linked with physical activity and depression, as well as its biological interpretation.Method492 participants with major depression disorder (MDD) and 535 healthy controls (HC) were extracted from the UK Biobank dataset. Partial least squares regression was first utilized to explore a replicable SC pattern simultaneously associated with physical activity and depressive mood. The neuromaps toolbox was applied to interpret the biological ontologies of the identified SC pattern. Neuroimaging-transcriptome association and enrichment analyses were conducted to explore its underlying genetic basis, pathways and cell types. The reproducibility and generalizability were tested on another independent MDD dataset (N=3,496) and bipolar disorder (BD) dataset (N=81).ResultsA SC pattern linked with exercise was identified to be both significantly correlated with depressive mood and group discriminative between MDDs and HCs, which primarily located between the motor-related regions and reward-related regions. This pattern was associated with multiple neurotransmitter receptors, such as serotonin and GABA receptors, and enriched in pathways like synaptic signaling and astrocytes cell type. The SC pattern and genetic results were also replicated in another independent MDD dataset and present commonalities with BD.ConclusionsThis study not only initially identified a reproducible shared SC pattern between physical activity and depressive mood, but also elucidated the underlying biological mechanisms, which enhanced our understanding of how exercise helps alleviate depression and may inform the development of novel neuromodulation targets.",

      "title": "Increased Reproducibility of Brain Organoids through Controlled Fluid Dynamics",
      "content": "Brain organoids are a promising model for studying human neurodevelopment and disease. Despite the potential, their 3D structure often exhibits high variability during differentiation across batches and cell lines, presenting a significant challenge for biomedical applications. During their development, organoids are exposed to fluid flow shear stress (fFSS) generated by the flow of culture media over the developing tissue. This stress is thought to disrupt cellular integrity and morphogenesis, leading to variation in organoids architecture, ultimately affecting reproducibility. Understanding the interplay between tissue morphology, cell identity and organoid developmental stage is therefore essential for advancing the use of brain organoids. Here, we demonstrate that reducing fFSS, by employing a vertically rotating chamber during neuronal induction, a critical phase for organoid morphogenesis, along with an extended human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) aggregation phase to minimize fusions, significantly improves the reproducibility of brain organoids. Remarkably, reducing fFSS minimized morphological structure variation and preserved transcriptional signature fidelity across differentiation batches and cell lines. This approach could enhance the reliability of brain organoid models, with important implications for neurodevelopmental research and preclinical studies.",

      "title": "Artificial intelligence-augmented drug discovery identifies gefitinib as a potential treatment for ALS",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by motor neuron (MN) death; however, astrocytes play a key role in disease pathogenesis. Developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to impact drug discovery in multiple ways, including the rapid identification of drug repurposing candidates. A combination of natural language processing and deep learning algorithms was used to generate a knowledge graph based on scientific literature, omics and chemical databases, and other public sources with the aim to identify drug repurposing candidates for ALS. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a cancer compound identified by AI, gefitinib, on MN survival, and to decipher its mode of action inin vitroandin vivomodels of ALS. We used co-cultures of healthy motor neurons with ALS patient-derived astrocytes (iAstrocytes), obtained through a semi-direct conversion protocol, to assess the neuroprotective properties of gefitinib. Compound treatment led to a significant rescue of MNs cultured with ALS iAstrocytes and a significant reduction in the levels of cleaved TDP-43 fragments in ALS iAstrocytes. Our data suggest that gefitinib-mediated activation of autophagy decreased the 35 kDa fragments of TDP-43. In a proof-of-conceptin vivostudy in SOD1G93Amice, gefitinib treatment significantly delayed the onset of neurological symptoms, thus showing the potential of AI-augmented drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders.Significance StatementThis study presents an AI-augmented method of identifying potential repurposing candidates for disease with an unprecedented speed. The AI\u2019s results were validatedin vitrousing iAstrocytes differentiated from induced neuronal progenitor cells (iNPCs), which are pathophysiologically relevant models suitable for studying neurodegeneration. iNPCs recapitulate many pathological hallmarks of the disease and they retain the ageing phenotype of the patient that they are obtained from. TDP-43 proteinopathy is one of the disease hallmarks observed in patients and is present in 97% of ALS patients. Here, we show gefitinib, a repurposing candidate identified by AI, improves survival of MNs in a co-culture with patient-derived astrocytes and can modulate TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

We used the distinct features of EEG oscillatory modes to train a classification algorithm, a support vector machine.ResultsAD patients exhibited a weakened slow-frequency response. Faster oscillatory modes displayed a biphasic response pattern in controls, characterized by an early increase followed by a widespread suppression, which was reduced in AD patients. Classification achieved robust discrimination performance (85%/23% true/false positive rate).ConclusionsAD causes an impairment in the oscillatory response to TMS that has distinct features in different frequency ranges. These features uncovered by MEMD could serve as an effective EEG diagnostic marker.SignificanceEarly detection of AD requires diagnostic tools that are both effective and accessible. Combining EEG with TMS shows great promise. Our results and method enhance TMS-EEG both as a practical diagnostic tool, and as a way to further our understanding of AD pathophysiology.",

      "content": "Mutations in ADNP (Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein) are among the most frequent monogenic causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and lead to Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS). Yet how ADNP dysfunction leads to HVDAS is unclear. We employed patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, cortical organoids and ADNP KO human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanism of HVDAS onset. We purified an ADNP-KDM1A-GTF2I (AKG) protein complex from hNSCs and show that it targets transposable elements (TEs) to repress nearby gene transcription. Upon ADNP KO, KDM1A binding is lost at promoters targeted by AKG, pointing to ADNP as the anchoring subunit of the AKG complex. HVDAS cortical organoids show impaired progenitor proliferation and accelerated neuronal differentiation, coupled with a sustained upregulation of neurogenesis transcriptional programs, including key transcription factors normally repressed by AKG. This work suggests that the AKG complex acts as the relevant ADNP unit in the molecular onset of HVDAS.",

      "content": "Background Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain-stimulation technique offering high spatial precision and depth penetrance. Theta burst TUS (tbTUS), featuring a temporal theta burst stimulation pattern, has been reported to facilitate corticomotor excitability, when applied to the human primary motor hand area (M1-HAND). However, replication attempts have yielded inconsistent results. Methods Fifteen healthy human participants underwent neuronavigated tbTUS targeting the left M1-HAND in the anterior wall of the precentral sulcus, as well as anterior and posterior active control sites. The three tbTUS conditions were applied in counterbalanced order on separate days. Corticospinal excitability was assessed via motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tbTUS, and analyzed using an rmANOVA. Results None of the tbTUS conditions produced consistent group-level changes in MEP amplitude at any time point. Both intra- and inter-subject variability were high, and individual MEP changes following precentral tbTUS did not correlate with changes after control-site stimulation. Conclusions We did not observe reliable modulatory effects of neuronavigated tbTUS on corticospinal excitability. Methodological and hardware differences may account for discrepancies across studies. Our findings align with recent reports questioning the robustness of tbTUS-induced facilitation.",

To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "content": "Factors influencing pupil size can be experimentally controlled or held constant in laboratory experiments, but how the pupil reflects changes in retinal input from the visual environment in real-world viewing conditions has yet to be captured in a large, age-diverse sample. In this dataset, we address this research gap by collecting data in a hybrid field-laboratory experiment (N=83, 43 female, age range 18\u201387 years) using a custom-built, wearable, video-based eye tracker with a spectroradiometer measuring spectral irradiance in the approximate corneal plane, resulting in a total of valid 29,664 recorded spectral irradiance and eye image pairs along with 83 approximately 3-minute-long calibration videos. After an initial 3-minute calibration procedure, 10-minute dark-adaptation period and a 14-minute controlled laboratory light condition, participants moved in and between indoor and outdoor environments of varying spectral irradiance for \u223c25\u201335 minutes and performed a range of everyday tasks. This dataset may provide a basis for developing algorithms for pupil detection, processing, and prediction under natural conditions.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
