These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "title": "Chronic electroconvulsive shock disrupts hippocampal physiology and impairs associative memory in mice",
      "content": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for depression but it has undesirable side effects on various aspects of cognition, including memory. Patients might display retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events and anterograde amnesia in tests of recall and recognition memory. These amnestic effects are likely to depend, at least in part, on changes in the hippocampus. ECT-induced volume increases in the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus subregion in particular, correlate with the cognitive deficits. However, the precise cellular and behavioral effects of ECT remain poorly understood. Here, we therefore subjected male and female mice to chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and examined effects on hippocampal physiology and memory. Perforant path inputs onto dentate gyrus neurons were examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings in hippocampal slices. In the intact slice, perforant path stimulation did not result in any synaptic or spiking differences in mice given sham vs ECS treatments. However, GABAA blockade increased depolarization and spiking in sham, but not ECS-treated, mice. Voltage clamp recordings further revealed weaker perforant path excitation of dentate gyrus neurons in ECS-treated mice. Extrapolating these findings to the intact animal, we then used Fos expression as a proxy for neural activity, and found that ECS blunted exploration-induced hippocampal activation, which was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus. Finally, recognition memory tasks revealed that ECS impaired memory for object-context associations but not memory for objects or locations. Collectively, these experiments reveal that a clinically relevant schedule of ECS disrupts synaptic and circuit functions of the hippocampus and causes anterograde amnesia in a test of episodic-like associative memory.",

      "title": "Effects of different slow paced breathing regimes on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oscillations",
      "content": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport is crucial for waste clearance and the maintenance of healthy brain function. Various factors, including respiration, have been proposed to drive CSF pulsation. Despite the close relationship between CSF movement and respiration, the impact of different slow respiratory frequencies on CSF oscillations remains unclear. Utilizing a fast neuroimaging technique, we investigated the effects of four different paced respiratory conditions on CSF oscillations. Our findings indicate that all paced respiratory conditions resulted in increased CSF oscillatory power and BOLD global signal amplitude, factors previously associated with increased CSF pulsations. Additionally, we observed that, compared to rest, paced sighing at the 0.02-0.03 Hz frequency range significantly increased the coupling between CSF oscillations and the negative derivative of the BOLD signal. Our study provides a novel perspective on how the frequency of breathing can influence CSF oscillations during wakefulness.",

      "title": "Activation of the medial entorhinal cortex drives memory-guided navigation behavior",
      "content": "The cognitive map in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is essential for spatial memory and exhibits experience-dependent changes. Yet, it remains unclear whether MEC activation is sufficient to drive memory-guided navigation, precluding a causal link between the MEC and spatial memory. To address this gap, we examined and optogenetically manipulated MEC activity as mice navigated a virtual track for a water reward based on memory. During learning, spatial activity in the pre-reward region showed the highest consistency along the track and closely paralleled improvements in reward-predictive behaviors. This elevated pre-reward consistency was widespread across MEC neurons, rather than confined to a particular cell type, indicating a network-level representation supporting reward prediction. Strikingly, optogenetic activation of MEC at non-reward locations biased reward-predictive behaviors toward stimulation sites, but only when stimulation patterns were spatially consistent. Consistent stimulation also induced anticipatory reward-seeking before stimulation onset and this behavior gradually developed with repeated stimulation, reflecting memory formation for stimulation locations. Moreover, in animals that failed to learn the track well, consistent pre-reward activation, alone or combined with landmark activation, significantly enhanced their reward prediction. Thus, spatially consistent MEC activation underlies memory-guided reward prediction, supporting a causal role for the MEC in spatial memory.",

      "content": "Cerebral cortical development is a finely regulated process, depending on neuronal progenitors, giving rise to post-mitotic neurons that migrate to superficial regions in the developing brain. Disruptions can give rise to cortical malformations, associated with intellectual disability and intractable epilepsy. Mutations in EML1/Eml1, coding for a microtubule-associated protein, lead to subcortical heterotopia in humans and mice. In developing mutant mouse brains, ectopic apical radial glia (aRG) progenitors were found outside the proliferative ventricular zone. The role of Eml1 in aRG is not precisely determined. Using proteomics and imaging approaches, we compared brain tissue from control and mutant mice and identified microtubule and organelle dysregulation. Eml1 influences the trafficking of organelles to different compartments of aRG, where they may be involved in local functions. Mitochondrial and polysome distribution are altered in mutant conditions. Indeed, Eml1 interacts with translational machinery, and downregulation of translation is observed in Eml1 mutant aRG translatome. Paradoxically, an upregulation of translation-related mRNAs is also observed. These data uncover an unprecedented function of Eml1 and associate novel subcellular mechanisms with severe heterotopia formation.",

      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

      "content": "Clinical trials suggest that a single dose of psilocybin is an effective treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). Choice impulsivity is a value-based decision-making bias that predicts drug-intake escalation and is commonly associated with SUDs. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regulates choice impulsivity and is enriched with 5-HT2A receptors that mediate effects of psilocybin. We hypothesized that psilocybin has long-term ([&ge;]48 hours) effects on choice impulsivity in association with dmPFC inhibitory interneurons with perineuronal nets (PNNs). Male Long Evans rats were trained in a delay discounting task (DDT) where rats chose between delayed large rewards (LR) and immediate small rewards (SR). 48 hours after psilocybin or vehicle injections, DDT was assessed, and rats brains processed for microscopy analysis of extracellular matrix (PNNs) together with inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and c-fos as a marker of neuronal activity. Psilocybin acutely increased head-twitch responses. Psilocybin decreased LR choices and increased the latency to LR choices 48 hours after administration. These effects were independent of delay and therefore not consistent with changes in impulsivity. Psilocybin also increased the density of PNN+PV+cFos triple-labeled neurons in the dmPFC. These results suggest that psilocybin decreases reward seeking through the increased activation of dmPFC PV interneurons with PNNs.",

      "content": "Formal theories of reinforcement learning (RL) prescribe a clearly defined function for dopamine: modulating learning via reward prediction errors (RPEs). Yet, empirical evidence in humans remains scarce, and recent advances introducing noisy RL cast doubt on a simple one-to-one mapping be-tween neurotransmitters and computational mechanisms. Here, we conducted a double-blind, pla-cebo-controlled, randomised pharmacological study using the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, while healthy volunteers performed a volatile two-armed bandit task. Behaviourally, L-DOPA decreased switching following below-average rewards. Algorithmic RL modelling of human behaviour supports a dual effect of L-DOPA on the rate and precision of learning. By leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as implementational models of RL, we explain this dual RL function through a single infer-ence-time modulation, whereby L-DOPA triggers a positive reward bias at the input of the recurrent layer that implements RL. Our findings highlight a unifying mechanism at the implementation level to explain seemingly disparate algorithmic effects.",

      "title": "Reconstruction of the human nigrostriatal pathway in vitro reveals target-dependent dopamine neuron maturation",
      "content": "The human nigrostriatal pathway, comprising dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) projecting to the dorsolateral striatum, is essential for motor control and selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease (PD). How this circuit assembles during development and how it degenerates under pathological conditions remains poorly understood in a human context and in vitro models capturing its long-range connectivity and spatial organization have been lacking. Here, we introduce the connectoid, a compartmentalized, human stem cell-based model of the nigrostriatal pathway that integrates vMB and striatal organoids within a custom-engineered microfluidic device, confining cell bodies while guiding axonal growth, mimicking the in vivo topography. Functional connectivity was confirmed by retrograde rabies tracing, and optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation, while 6-hydroxydopamine induced selective degeneration of dopamine neurons, recapitulating a key feature of PD. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics revealed that interaction with striatal targets enhances dopaminergic neuron maturation and activates transcriptional programs linked to synaptic signaling. Thus, connectoids uniquely allow spatial segregation of regionalized organoids while preserving long-range communication, providing a scalable and physiologically relevant platform for studying human circuit assembly, selective vulnerability, and therapeutic interventions in PD.",

      "content": "High-quality neurotypical postmortem human brain tissue is essential but difficult to obtain for constructing comprehensive human brain cell atlases. Here we describe the establishment of UC Irvine Brain Procurement Program, a coordinated initiative to collect and process neurotypical donor brains for multiomic mapping studies within the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) consortium. Through partnerships with the Orange County Coroner Office, the UC Irvine Willed Body Program, UCI Medical Center, and the Children Hospital of Orange County, we have developed standardized workflows encompassing donor identification, postmortem brain recovery and processing, region-of-interest dissection, neurotypical donor selection, and data management. Our experience demonstrates the feasibility of a community-based, multi-institutional procurement framework while highlighting challenges in recruiting neurotypical donors and ensuring demographic representation reflective of Southern California. We further identify opportunities to strengthen outreach and donation pathways. This program provides a scalable model for advancing population-reflective, high-quality human brain cell atlas efforts.",
