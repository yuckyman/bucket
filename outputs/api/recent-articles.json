      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Proteome Complexity Scales with Architecture in Human Neural Models",
      "content": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins, providing molecular insight into neural development and cellular organization. Applying this approach to in vitro systems of increasing architectural complexity, we compared immortalized monolayer cell lines with two tissue-like neural models. Here, we present a comparative proteomic analysis of three human neural models: SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (2D), neurospheres, and cerebral organoids. Protein profiling revealed a stepwise increase in molecular complexity, with enhanced detection of neural-related proteins linked to axon guidance, synapse formation, and GTPase signaling. This trend was most pronounced in tissue-like models, underscoring their suitability for studying neuronal maturation and circuit assembly. Functional enrichment analyses showed progressive acquisition of neurodevelopmental programs, including synaptic vesicle cycling, presynaptic organization, neurotransmitter regulation, and late-stage gliogenesis, accompanied by increased expression of astrocytic and oligodendrocytic markers. Kinase diversity also increased across models, reaching up to 210 regulatory kinases in organoids, many implicated in neural development and degeneration. Gene set enrichment for neurological pathways mirrored this trend, aligning proteomic complexity with disease relevance. Regional brain mapping further indicated that organoids most closely recapitulate the protein architecture of the human CNS. Together, these findings demonstrate that tissue-like neural models provide richer proteomic landscapes that approximate in vivo brain biology and support the application of integrative proteomics in neuroscience and translational research.",

      "title": "Spatial and Temporal Regulation of K+ Buffering in Hippocampal Astrocytes",
      "content": "Distinct subregions within the same structure (such as along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus) can exhibit unique molecular and physiological properties that relate to their functional specificity. These properties can be further modulated by circadian cycles. Understanding how extracellular potassium (K) is regulated within this complex spatial and temporal framework is essential, as K dynamics directly influence neuronal excitability in both health and disease. Here, we reveal that hippocampal K dynamics exhibit pronounced subregional modulation and circadian specificity, with the ventral hippocampus (VH) showing faster K clearance than the dorsal hippocampus (DH), despite reduced functional Kir4.1 currents in VH astrocytes. This interplay between subregional organization, circadian regulation, astroglial K signaling, and Kir4.1 function provides new insights into the homeostatic control of hippocampal K, offering a framework for understanding space- and time-dependent dysfunction in conditions such as epilepsy.",

      "content": "Learning from rewards and punishments is crucial for adaptive decision-making, but it is still unclear how individuals integrate prediction errors to update beliefs in uncertain environments, particularly the distinctions between reward and punishment learning. We employed a probabilistic classification task and situated electroencephalography (EEG) signals within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, investigating distinctions between reward and punishment learning. Our findings indicate that participants exhibited superior learning performance in reward context compared to punishment context. Fitting the hierarchical Bayesian model revealed that punishment drives faster Bayesian belief updates, although these did not translate into improved behavioral outcomes. At the neural level, higher-level precision-weighted prediction error (pwPE2) was significantly positively correlated with FRN amplitude in the punishment context but not in the reward context, and the positive effect of pwPE2 on P300 amplitude was stronger in the punishment than the reward condition. These results provide electrophysiological signatures of punish context driving faster belief updates in uncertain environments. Our results provide novel evidence for a dual-process framework in reinforcement learning, underscoring distinct neural mechanisms underlying reward and punishment learning.",

      "content": "Fluent speech depends on precisely timed motor commands that coordinate rapid transitions between successive articulatory gestures. Using direct cortical recordings, we identified a prominent sensorimotor theta oscillation (6-10 Hz) that supports this coordination. During articulation, premotor speech circuits exhibited enhanced theta phase coherence, with elevated population activity near theta troughs. The oscillation's frequency remained remarkably stable across varying speech rates and cognitive states, consistent with an intrinsically generated rhythm. Vocal-tract kinematics revealed pulse-like movements at 6-10 Hz, tightly coupled to cortical theta phase. At a mesoscopic scale, theta cycles structured sequential sensorimotor activations encoding articulatory gestures, with syllable identity optimally decodable following theta troughs. These findings identify theta oscillations as an intrinsic timing mechanism that coordinates the distributed and synergistic motor control underlying fluent speech.",

      "title": "NATO3 protects dopaminergic neurons in mouse in vivo and human in vitro Parkinson's disease models",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the progressive and unstoppable loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. We previously identified NATO3 (FERD3L), a conserved developmental transcription factor, as essential for maintaining DA neuron function during aging. Here, we show that AAV-mediated Nato3 gene transfer into the mouse substantia nigra prevents DA neuron degeneration in both MPTP-induced and -synuclein (-Syn) overexpression PD models. This neuroprotective effect is achieved by improving autophagic flux and -Syn clearance. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated NATO3 overexpression in human midbrain DA neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the pathological -Syn A53T mutation, effectively reversed key disease hallmarks. These include -Syn accumulation, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, autophagic impairments, and compromised neurite structure. Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro findings highlight NATO3's role in safeguarding DA neurons against pathological cellular events, positioning NATO3 as a therapeutic target for PD.",

      "title": "Notch canonical activity in a subset of glial cells regulates short-term memory in Drosophila",
      "content": "Notch is a transmembrane receptor expressed at the cell surface that mediates transcriptional responses upon binding to its ligands, in a variety of contexts. Evolutionarily conserved, Notch plays a key role in numerous cell fate decisions during development and is also required in post-mitotic brain neurons for the consolidation of long-term memory and long-term habituation. Notch signaling is highly expressed in glial cells, where it plays a key role in regulating their development and proliferation. More recently, a Notch-dependent neuroglial pathway has been implicated in modulating the susceptibility of short-term memory to sleep deprivation in Drosophila. In this study, we demonstrate that canonical Notch signaling in glia -mediated by the Delta ligand and the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless- is activated in a subset of cortex and ensheathing glial cells. This signaling is essential for the formation of short-term memory in the aversive phototaxic suppression assay, which is sensitive to sleep deprivation. Dopaminergic transmission is known to be required for this type of learning and is negatively impacted by sleep deprivation, suggesting a possible interaction between Notch and dopamine pathways. Supporting this idea, we find that modulating dopaminergic transmission downregulates canonical Notch activity in glial cells. Conversely, activating Notch signaling in glia near dopaminergic neurons prevents the learning impairments typically caused by sleep deprivation. Notably, Notch signaling itself does not appear to alter dopamine levels in the brain. Together, these findings indicate that canonical Notch signaling in a specific subset of glial cells is essential for short-term memory formation and is modulated by dopaminergic signaling. This suggests that sleep loss-induced disruption of dopaminergic transmission impairs learning by downregulating canonical Notch signaling. Since Notch homologs are highly expressed in mammalian glia, this pathway may be conserved and functionally relevant in other species, including humans.",

      "title": "Altered Sense of Agency in First-Episode Schizophrenia Patients: A Comparative Study Across Two Sites",
      "content": "Background: Disturbances in the sense of agency are a key marker of schizophrenia and are closely linked to core symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions of influence. Neuroimaging studies have implicated cortical midline structures and the default mode network (DMN) associated with self-related processing, but replication across sites and larger samples is needed. Methods: We examined neural correlates of self- versus other-agency judgments in two independent cohorts of first-episode schizophrenia patients (n = 177) and controls (n = 123) recruited at separate MRI centers. During fMRI, participants performed an agency-related task. Data were analyzed using independent component analysis and statistical parametric mapping, focusing on networks associated with self-referential processing. Results: Across both sites, self-agency consistently engaged the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, key regions of the DMN. Schizophrenia patients exhibited significantly reduced DMN activation during self-referential processing compared to controls. While site-related differences were noted in the magnitude of activation, the core pattern of DMN disruption was robust across analytic approaches and datasets. Conclusions: This study replicates and extends prior findings of altered self-agency processing in schizophrenia, demonstrating consistent DMN hypo-activation in first-episode patients across two independent cohorts. These results validate the agency paradigm as a reliable probe of self-related neural mechanisms and support models of schizophrenia as a disorder of altered self-perception.",

      "title": "Attention Improves Population Codes by Warping Neural Manifolds in Human Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Decades of research on visual attention have revealed its numerous effects on neural responses. Two competing models have been proposed for how these effects lead to improved population representations: one highlights changes in neural tuning, while the other points towards changes in trial-by-trial noise correlations. Here, we develop a neural population manifold framework that interprets changes in neural responses as geometric transformations in high-dimensional neural space, allowing us to disentangle and quantify the effects of tuning changes and correlation changes induced by attention. Applying this framework to extensive measurements of cortical responses during different attentional tasks, we find that tuning changes are the primary driver of improved population representations. In contrast, correlation changes, though present, have minimal--or even detrimental--effects to information content due to its strong interactions with other changes (e.g., tuning, variability). Our results support the \"tuning change\" model of visual attention and demonstrate a general framework for adjudicating how different aspects of neural coding affect information processing.",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "Tuning into flavor: predicting coffee sensory attributes from EEG with boosted-tree regression models",
      "content": "Flavor, a multimodal perception based on taste, smell, and tactile cues, plays a significant role in consumer preferences and purchase intentions toward coffee. In this exploratory study, we assessed the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict coffee sensory attributes. We extracted spectral and temporal features from a professional panel while tasting coffee samples and basic water solutions. We trained multiple Least-Squares Boosted Trees (LSBoost) and optimized their hyperparameters through a 100-step Bayesian approach based on a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) scheme. The models achieved, overall, high predictive accuracy (MAE < 0.75 on a 0 \u2212 10 scale) and medium-to-large robustness (Cohen'sd>0.6) with respect to mean and lasso benchmark regressors. Feature importance analysis revealed that spectral powers and Hjorth's parameters within parietal, central, and frontal regions were the most predictive. Our findings endorse the use of EEG-based ML models as an alternative to traditional flavor evaluation methods, such as Descriptive Sensory Analysis (DSA).",

      "content": "BackgroundPeriodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a sleep-related movement disorder, which may be accompanied by a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). With this study, we reported a clinical therapy process up to 2.5\u202fyears follow-up, exploring the therapeutic effect of a series of medicines in PLMD comorbid EDS.Case presentationA 27-year-old woman suffered from EDS for more than 10\u202fyears and was then diagnosed with PLMD. Initially, we used levodopa 250\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, then piribedil 50\u202fmg per night was arranged as the second drug for 12\u202fweeks, and the third drug, pramipexole, was prescribed at a dosage of 0.25\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, but the EDS was persistent despite the periodic leg movement index (PLMI) returning to normal. Finally, methylphenidate was prescribed at a dosage of 18\u202fmg per day after 4\u202fweeks of washout. Then, the indicators of EDS and PLMD all returned to normal after 6\u202fweeks. A 2.5-year follow-up was scheduled for taking methylphenidate; the symptoms of EDS were steadily well controlled, and PLMI was still kept in the normal range.ConclusionThis finding suggests that methylphenidate is an optimal therapeutic approach for the management of PLMD comorbid EDS.",
