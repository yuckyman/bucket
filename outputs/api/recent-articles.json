      "title": "VCAP-102 Achieves Exceptional BBB Penetration in Marmosets After Ten Years of AAV Capsid Evaluation",
      "content": "Efficient passage of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for achieving broad central nervous system transduction following systemic delivery. Since PHP.B was reported in 2016 to exhibit high BBB permeability in C57BL/6J mice, many BBB-penetrant capsids have been developed, yet their performance often varies substantially across species. From 2016 to 2025, we produced each newly reported BBB-penetrant capsid as its sequence became available and evaluated it under standardized intravenous administration conditions in marmosets. This included PHP.B, PHP.eB, AAV-F, CAP-B22, CAP-B10, CPP.16, CAP-Mac, and BR1N. Although several of these capsids have been reported to penetrate the marmoset BBB, none reproduced these effects under our unified evaluation conditions. We also pursued several directed-evolution approaches to engineer AAV9-based variants with improved BBB permeability; however, none surpassed AAV9. In 2025, VCAP-102 was reported as an AAV9-derived capsid with BBB permeability in mice and non-human primates. When evaluated using our standardized framework, VCAP-102 consistently mediated markedly stronger and more widespread whole-brain transduction than AAV9 across all three animals tested. These findings provide a decade-long, systematic assessment of BBB-penetrant AAV capsids in marmosets and identify VCAP-102 as a highly promising candidate for future systemically delivered AAV-based gene therapies.",

      "title": "Stress Coping Style Alters Functional Brain Network Activity to Acute Stressor",
      "content": "Consistent individual differences in behavior (e.g., personality types, stress coping styles) are a common occurrence across animal taxa. One hypothesis poses that the resulting constraints for within-individual behavioral variation may also lead to constraints for the evolution of behavior. With stress coping styles seen across taxa, it suggests a common underlying proximate mechanism. In this study we investigated neural activity patterns across the brain by quantifying immediate early gene expression in individuals with alternative stress coping styles in response to an acute stressor in zebrafish (Danio rerio). While immediate early gene expression levels of individual brain regions in the aversive brain network were similar across groups, functional network activity differed. There were several differences across groups including interactions between the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal homologs. One brain area that had many different connections across groups was the central gray. There were many differences involving central gray activity between proactive and reactive fish at baseline suggesting that baseline activity may prime for the reaction to stress. Collectively, baseline brain activity can predict behaviors, suggesting that these differences in brain interactions at baseline may be important for biasing behavioral responses to stressors that characterizes a stress coping style.",

      "title": "Multiscale characterisation of the human claustrum from histology to MRI",
      "content": "Though linked to an unusually broad array of functions, the human claustrum's complex morphology has hindered in vivo study, resulting in a small MRI literature marked by implausibly large discrepancies in reported characteristics. We constructed the first three-dimensional histological \"gold standard\" claustrum model, and systematically evaluated in vivo 7-Tesla MRI datasets against it and downsampled derivatives. MRI showed resolution-dependent differences rather than contrast limitations, transforming the claustrum's intricate sheet into an artefactually thickened ribbon. However, submillimetre MRI reliably recovered the dorsal \"core\" that contains most claustral volume and density and houses major corticoclaustral connectivity. At 0.5mm resolution, extension into the temporal lobe, including irregular ventral \"puddles\", was partially recovered, with uncertainty reflecting boundary imprecision rather than anatomical loss. Our results refute the view that the claustrum is inaccessible in the living human brain, define practical measurement limits, and provide a foundation for future functional investigations.",

      "title": "Tissue-to-Bytes: A Catalytic Digital Twin Platform for Consortium-Scale Integration of Single-Cell Omics Data in BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network",
      "content": "The NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and data scientists to create reference brain cell atlases to be used by the research community as a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of human brain function and disorders. Coordinated sharing and management of the scarce human brain tissue, across lifespans and among the eleven participating BICAN centers and laboratories with anatomical precision, is a formidable undertaking. Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIPM provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone. The NIMP digital twin paradigm not only serves BICAN; it provides a blueprint for future-proof data coordination at consortium scale.",

      "content": "While Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically triggers cognitive decline, some individuals with significant AD pathology maintain normal cognition into late life. Understanding the neuronal underpinnings of such cognitive resilience would propel the development of interventions for delaying dementia. To this end, we used cognitive testing to identify a subset of cognitively resilient 13-month-old TgF344-AD rats (established AD) and their non-transgenic littermates, followed by Neuropixels recording from 8500 neurons during repeated somatosensory stimulation. Cognitively resilient TgF344-AD rats recruited fewer neurons yet displayed more stable neuronal representations during repeated stimulations in cortical excitatory and hippocampal inhibitory ensembles, with reduced excitatory spike burstiness during network activation and a distinct pattern of functional synaptic connectivity. These associations existed independently of amyloid and tau levels. For the first time, our study revealed neuronal population-level hallmarks of maintained cognition that may serve as a novel neurophysiological biomarker of cognitive resilience and a target for stabilizing cognition.",

      "title": "Genetic Targeting and Conductance-Based Modeling Reveal Novel Diversity Within Mouse Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons",
      "content": "Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit auditory signals from the cochlea to the brain and are divided into two main types: type I and type II, distinguished by their anatomy and connectivity. However, the function of type II SGNs remains poorly understood due to their scarcity and lack of clear physiological markers. In this study, we use two Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter mouse lines to enhance the identification and targeting of type II SGNs for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We reveal a set of distinguishing biophysical features, most notably, the presence of an inactivating potassium current and weaker voltage-gated sodium currents, that clearly separate type II SGNs from their type I counterparts. Additionally, we uncover greater-than-expected heterogeneity among type II SGNs, including variation in size, excitability, and ion channel expression. These features suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of type II SGNs, with potential differences in function. We find that most type II SGNs are relatively inexcitable and incapable of sustained firing. Instead, they appear to be better suited to integrating sustained signals, potentially supporting roles in detecting cochlear damage or modulating efferent feedback. Additionally, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that removing the inactivation component of the inactivating potassium current specific to type II SGNs allowed repetitive spiking to similar levels seen in type I SGNs, suggesting a crucial role for the current in stifling type II SGN activity. Together, our findings define biophysical signatures that distinguish SGN types and subtypes, offering new insight into their contributions to normal hearing and cochlear pathology.",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "content": "IntroductionColor is a critical determinant of esthetic experience, shaping both immersion and cognitive responses. However, the extent to which the sequence of color exposure modulates the interplay between neural activation and ocular behavior remains insufficiently understood.MethodsTen chromatic landscape paintings were collected and converted into achromatic versions, yielding a total of 20 visual stimuli. Participants were assigned to two conditions: Condition A (achromatic to chromatic) and Condition B (chromatic to achromatic). Visual attention and prefrontal activation were assessed using eye-tracking techniques and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.ResultsAnalyses revealed significantly greater neural activation in Condition A within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.006), left orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043), and right orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043). Eye-tracking metrics indicated longer Total duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.015), Maximum duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.036), and Total duration of whole fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.025) under Condition A. Subjective evaluations also showed significant differences, with higher ratings for Match (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.005) and Feel (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.029).DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that color stimuli exert a decisive influence not only on subjective immersion but also on objective neurocognitive processes. The study extends the scientific foundation of empirical esthetics and offers novel implications for the design of museum and exhibition environments.",

      "content": "Growing evidence highlights the adverse clinical effects and societal implications of loneliness, i.e., the negative feeling associated with a perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social connections. To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",

Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The patients were divided into a training set (191 cases) and a validation set (82 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Seven machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, GBDT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) were employed to construct predictive models. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall, F1 score, MCC, AUROC, and SHAP was used for model interpretation.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, CRP, Fazekas score, and IASA score were associated with cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, Fazekas score, and IASA score were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an AUROC of 0.8373 for the validation set.

      "title": "Advances of neuroimaging findings in medication overuse headache",
      "content": "Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic secondary headache disorder that develops from excessive analgesic use. The prevalence of MOH is estimated 1\u20132% in the general population, reaching up to 50% among individuals with chronic headache. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MOH remain incompletely understood, neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into its developments. This review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that MOH is associated with structural and functional alterations in two key neural systems: (1) the pain matrix involved in nociceptive processing, (2) the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry implicated in addictive behaviors. Importantly, certain structural and functional changes show partial reversibility following medication withdrawal. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to establish causal relationships between these neurobiological changes and the development/maintenance of MOH, which remains essential for developing targeted interventions.",

      "title": "Development of a non-human primate model for preclinical research of a novel auditory nerve implant",
      "content": "The cochlear implant is a widely available hearing restoration technology that can provide speech understanding in quiet environments. This technology struggles however, in noisy settings or situations involving multiple speakers. The primary cause of these performance limitations is a poor neural interface, in which the bony wall of the cochlea separates the electrode surface from the auditory nerve fibers, thus causing unwanted current spread and non-specific frequency activation. This study utilizes an alternative auditory prosthetic technology (auditory nerve implant, ANI) that enables direct auditory nerve stimulation, which provides a potentially superior neural interface and enables more precise targeting of auditory nerve fibers than traditional cochlear implants. As auditory nerve implants progress towards clinical translation, new implant designs and stimulation strategies will be created. Animal models to efficiently test and iterate through these new designs will be useful for the continued development of ANI technology. We present a viable surgical approach in the non-human primate (rhesus macaque) along with electrophysiological results that demonstrate robust activation of the auditory system at low current levels via intraneural stimulation. Our findings indicate that the rhesus macaque, which possesses an inner ear anatomy more similar to the human compared to other animal models used in the hearing field (e.g., rodents, felines and ferrets), has strong potential as a useful preclinical testbed involving an upright head model for future ANI prototypes and stimulation strategy development.",

      "title": "Characteristic of cerebral hemodynamics and functional connectivity in patients with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: an exploratory study",
      "content": "BackgroundThis study investigated the brain functional characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain (NP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).MethodsA total of 35 subjects were enrolled, including 10 able-bodied controls, 12 patients with SCI and NP (SCI-NP), and 13 patients with SCI (without NP). fNIRS was used to detected blood oxygen signals during motor tasks and resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in the subjects. We also performed Pearson correlation analyses of pain scores (NPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in patients with SCI-NP. Statistical analyses were performed using Shapiro-Wilk test for normality; paired t-test for intra-group differences; ANOVA (LSD post-hoc, Bonferroni-corrected) for multi-group comparisons; Cohen's d/partial \u03b72 for effect size; independent samples t-test (FDR-corrected) for inter-group FC differences.ResultsDuring the task state, patients with SCI-NP activated bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1, L/R P = 0.044/0.032), bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA, L/R P = 0.041/0.037), right primary motor cortex and left parietal lobe (LPL, P = 0.047). Hemodynamic changes in the bilateral S1, secondary somatosensory cortex, SMA, and right prefrontal cortex of patients with SCI-NP were significantly stronger than those in the other two groups. During RS, the whole-brain and most inter/intra-regional FC strength trended able-bodied controls > patients with SCI > patients with SCI-NP. NPS strongly correlated with LPL (r = 0.977, P = 0.004); PSQI correlated with motor cortex HbO changes (r = 0.889\u22120.975, P = 0.005\u22120.043).ConclusionPatients with SCI-NP exhibit significant abnormal cerebral cortical excitation and reduced FC. HbO is a potential biomarker for evaluating NP. fNIRS supports objective assessment of SCI-NP and rehabilitation strategy formulation [ChiCTR2500097098].",

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",
