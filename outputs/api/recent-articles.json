      "title": "Adaptation of motor control strategies and physiological arousal during repeated blocks of split-belt walking",
      "content": "Physiological arousal, mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), is known to co-modulate with adaptation of motor control strategies, governed by the central nervous system (CNS), in response to repeated standing perturbations. However, adaptation of the ANS physiological arousal response during repeat exposure to walking challenges remains unknown. This study examines the physiological arousal response (electrodermal activation, EDA) and motor control strategy of gait during a single session of repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking. Twenty young adults completed three repeated blocks (3.5 min each) of split-belt walking (2:1 speed ratio) alternating with three blocks of tied-belt walking. Step length symmetry (SLS), EDA, bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle activation and ground reaction forces (GRFs) were measured. For each walking block, the first (early) and last (late) 15 strides were analyzed. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) tested the effect of repeated blocks and phases (early/late) on SLS. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) examined patterns of within-block changes in EDA, muscle activation, and GRFs. The greatest within-block adaptation of SLS occurred during first exposure to split-belt walking (S1; p<.001). Similarly, the largest magnitude of within-block adaptation in muscle activation, GRFs, and EDA occurred during S1 (p<.05). Attenuated EDA responses together with lower magnitude of motor adaptation in subsequent split blocks 2 and 3 were observed, indicating savings across the ANS and CNS. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ANS-mediated physiological arousal response modulates alongside the CNS-driven locomotor adaptation to repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking.",

      "title": "Trial-by-trial fluctuations in decision criterion shape confidence",
      "content": "Many of the choices we make are accompanied by a sense of confidence. Within classical Signal Detection Theory (SDT), confidence is conceptualized as the absolute distance between a decision variable and a decision criterion. The decision criterion is traditionally modelled as being stable over an experimental session. However, recent work challenges the notion of a static decision criterion, suggesting instead that the criterion undergoes trial-by-trial fluctuations. Combining SDT theory and model simulations, we predict that fluctuations in the decision criterion shape confidence. In 15 human decision-making datasets, trial-by-trial estimates of decision criterion were obtained with the Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion (hMFC). Across all datasets, we confirmed our pre-registered hypothesis that confidence is shaped by single-trial criterion state. This effect was found in 14 out of 15 individual datasets, indicating a robust pattern across a variety of task paradigms and confidence reporting scales. Going beyond self-report, the shaping of confidence by criterion fluctuations was replicated in an implicit measure of confidence, RTs, and in two key neurophysiological markers, pupil-linked arousal and a neural signature of confidence. Our results demonstrate that variability in confidence, which has traditionally been treated as noise, actually reflects genuine sensitivity to the current state of the (fluctuating) decision criterion.",

      "content": "Innate behaviors are hardwired into the nervous system, allowing animals to produce them instinctively and without prior learning. This includes social behaviors (e.g., aggression, courtship) in most animals. If and how learning shapes such innate behaviors has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate learning from social feedback in Drosophila. We use closed-loop optogenetics to systematically perturb the social experience of individual flies during courtship, and find that altered feedback changes the male fly's innate courtship strategy, opening the door for investigating the neural and molecular basis of social plasticity in flies.",

      "content": "<p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

      "title": "Potentiation of Nigra-Striatal Dopaminergic Projection Underpins Core Autism-Like Behaviors in Valproate-Exposed Mice",
      "content": "<p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>",

      "title": "Stimulus Contingency and Task Context Encoding within the Anterior Cingulate-Amygdala-Cerebellum Associative Learning Network",
      "content": "<p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>",

      "title": "Optical Recordings of Unitary Synaptic Connections Reveal High and Random Local Connectivity between CA3 Pyramidal Cells",
      "content": "<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>",

      "title": "Asymmetries in Foveal Vision",
      "content": "<p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the  foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only  away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~ away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>",
