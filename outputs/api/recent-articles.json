      "title": "Canonical cortical architecture supports the emergence of noise-invariant auditory representations",
      "content": "Neurons in the auditory system must represent behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise (BN) to support noise-invariant perception and behavior. Although primary auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in constructing noise-invariant representations, it remains unclear which excitatory subpopulations within ACtx carry out this transformation from noise-dependent to noise-invariant coding. To address this, we presented pure tones with and without continuous BN to head-fixed mice and used two-photon calcium imaging to record sound-evoked activity from three major excitatory subpopulations in ACtx: layer (L)2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, L5 IT neurons, and L5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. L2/3 IT neurons exhibited strong noise dependence at the level of single-neuron responses, pairwise interactions, and population representations. In contrast, deep-layer pathways showed greater noise invariance, with L5 IT neurons preserving stable representations most consistently and L5 ET neurons exhibiting more limited invariance at the population level. These findings reveal a functional division of labor in ACtx, in which superficial neurons remain noise-dependent and deep-layer broadcast pathways, particularly L5 IT, preferentially carry noise-invariant representations, suggesting that excitatory subpopulations contribute differentially to the construction and propagation of noise-invariant codes.",

      "title": "Knockout of Rab27b exacerbates neuropathology in alpha-synuclein mouse models",
      "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies are characterized by the formation of inclusions comprised of alpha-synuclein (syn) among other proteins, but the mechanisms by which these inclusions form and cause toxicity are not well understood. We have previously reported that the small GTPase Rab27b modulates autophagic-lysosomal function in neurons and supports lysosomal degradation of syn across multiple syn cellular models. Knockout (KO) and knockdown of Rab27b damage lysosomal degradative capacity and exacerbate syn pathology, while Rab27b overexpression is conversely protective in cellular syn models. Elevations of Rab27b seen in human synucleinopathies suggest a compensatory role for Rab27b in these disorders. Here, we examined the role Rab27b plays in vivo in the context of both A53T genetic syn overexpression and viral AAV syn overexpression mouse models. Rab27b knockout in A53T+ mice did not alter motor behavior or survival. However, Rab27b knockout increased proteinase-K resistant syn in the cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra of A53T mice starting as early as six months of age. Additionally, Rab27b KO increased phosphorylated S129 syn in the cortex and nigra. Astrocyte and microglial activation were also observed upon Rab27b KO in the A53T model. In the AAV syn model, Rab27b KO resulted in accelerated dopaminergic cell loss in the nigra. Collectively, we report that loss of Rab27b results in elevated neuropathology in PD-relevant brain regions, validating its role as a therapeutic target in synucleinopathies.",

      "content": "A single cortical impact in mice altered the number and molecular composition of excitatory synapses across 222 brain regions. Early effects targeted synapses with rapid protein turnover, followed by changes in slow-turnover synapses. This injury-induced remodelling of synaptome architecture mirrors responses to genetic mutation, ageing, sleep deprivation and experience, suggesting that reorganisation of excitatory synapse populations is a shared mechanism underlying brain plasticity across diverse conditions.",

      "title": "Shapes of synaptic protein distributions distinguish brain architectures",
      "content": "Neuronal activity is the result of the orchestrated actions of multitudes of synapses, acting and evolving not as individuals, but as populations. We therefore collected, for millions of synapses, a functionally relevant proxy for their strengths. Namely, we measured postsynaptic protein content by deploying a fluorescent PSD95 variant. Then we summarized, by statistical moments, the shapes of the distributions of protein contents, over local synaptic populations. In this way we explored the hypothesis that such collective properties inform on brain architectures. Our measurements cover complete parasagittal sections of the mouse brain, in animals one week to 18 months old. We identified a hierarchical organization of regions along the anterior-posterior axis, with three main clusters of divergent synaptic population shapes. One includes telencephalic regions, one is centered in the midbrain and hindbrain, and one comprises mainly the thalamus and the cerebellum. The structure emerging from our approach aligns with discoveries in studies of regional patterns of cellular gene expressions. Our results suggest that synaptic populations are dynamically regulated over the lifespan. Regions which at three months of age have thinner tails largely conserve their distribution shapes later in life, whereas heavy tails in other regions strikingly grow ever more so.",

      "content": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) shows striking clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity, yet a systematic analysis of subtype-specific features and inter-patient variability was missing. We treated human neurons and neuron-like cells with 30 postmortem brain samples and quantified neoaggregate formation, loss of function and changes in the TDP-43 interactome to define determinants of seeding outcomes. Potent FTLD-TDP-A seeds drove a progressive collapse of physiological TDP-43 interactions accompanied by functional loss. Beyond the burden of pathological TDP-43, we identified the fibrillar core of the lysosomal protein TMEM106B as a critical pro-seeding factor. Transient lysosomal injury markedly enhanced neoaggregation and loss of function, likely by promoting fibril interactions with native TDP-43. Our work establishes a mechanistic link between TMEM106B and TDP-43 aggregation, identifies lysosomal escape as a key driver of pathology and introduces the strongest model yet for seeded TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function, to enable discovery of disease modifiers.",

      "content": "There is substantial scientific interest in improving approaches that can enhance cognition through brain stimulation. We implemented a non-invasive focal Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) approach with known longer-lasting post-stimulation effects in two rhesus macaques performing a context-dependent memory-sequencing task implemented on multiple touchscreens within their home units. Consistently in both monkeys, TUS to the anterior -- but not posterior -- medial temporal lobe enhanced performance under stable memory-sequencing contexts. TUS to the medial prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, selectively improved performance when contexts were unstable and the monkey needed to adapt to both a change in context and temporal sequence. These findings shed new light on fronto-temporal nodes that, when perturbed, can selectively enhance cognitive performance, paving the way for further developing non-invasive approaches to improve cognitive function in humans and to study neural circuits under focal perturbation across species.",

      "content": "Generalized seizures reflect a pathological state of sudden, global neuronal hypersynchrony. The mechanisms that support the initiation and maintenance of such synchrony remain unknown. Using simultaneous single-unit and electrocorticographic recordings in two mouse models of absence epilepsy, we evaluated the activity of approximately 2,000 individual neurons across 26 brain structures. By doing so, we resolved the temporal progression of single neuron activity prior to and during generalized seizures. Surprisingly, we observed that rhythmic, synchronized activity emerges early and gradually in both thalamus and cortex. Moreover, while we observe that individual neurons across most structures fire rhythmically and synchronously during seizures, a small subset of thalamic nuclei stand out as hubs, displaying activity that is strongly correlated across multiple regions. Thus, our findings collectively highlight the thalamus as an early driver of global and pathological neuronal hypersynchrony.",

      "title": "Endothelial NMDA receptor involvement in retinal neurovascular damage following prenatal alcohol exposure in mouse model",
      "content": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) induces neurodevelopmental damage leading to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by altering both brain and ocular development. Recent data showed that PAE impairs brain cortical and retinal vasculature leading to defective positioning of interneurons. In the retina, PAE disturbs vascular development and the association of calretinin neurons with vessels. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a major target of alcohol in the brain, and both ligand binding to NMDARs and the expression of NMDAR subunits are altered in FASD. Given that NMDAR is also expressed in endothelial cells and that glutamate stimulation of endothelial NMDAR (eNMDAR) regulates cortical interneuron positioning along blood vessels, we hypothesize that eNMDAR is critical for retinal vascular development and mediates PAE-induced defects. Using an in vivo model of FASD and transgenic mice lacking, specifically in endothelial cells, the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR, this study aimed to characterize the neurovascular phenotype of the developing retina. The results show that eNMDAR knockout delays the formation of the superficial vascular plexus and prevents the alterations in vascular organization and neuronal density induced by PAE, particularly cells positioned closer to the retinal vasculature, namely ganglion, amacrine, and horizontal cells. Moreover, eNMDAR deletion led to an increased number of calretinin-positive interneurons in contact with perforating vessels and prevents the decrease induced by PAE. Together, these findings demonstrate that eNMDARs are essential for normal retinal neurovascular development and mediate, at least in part, the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure in FASD.",

      "content": "Understanding how neural activity gives rise to cognitive processes such as selective attention is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. An important but often overlooked advance towards this goal requires the development and sharing of rigorous and reproducible behavioral tasks across labs; this is particularly important given the recent surge in studies of cognition and perception in mice. Here, we developed a standardized training protocol for head-fixed mice to become experts in a psychometric visual contrast detection task in just 17 days. Experts detected stimuli at two distinct spatial locations for several hundred trials per day. As consecutive trials elapsed at either location, the speed, accuracy, and contrast sensitivity of visual perception improved - all hallmarks of spatial attention improving performance, as seen in primates. These findings validate the efficacy of this protocol to reveal multiple aspects of selective spatial attention in mice, establishing a rigorous and reproducible tool for the community.",

      "title": "Selective dysregulation of serotonin dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex and central amygdala following binge alcohol consumption",
      "content": "Serotonin (5HT) is a critical modulator of brain function and behavior that is dysregulated in alcohol use disorder (AUD). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) play distinct roles in AUD and undergo functional changes in 5HT signaling following binge drinking, but our understanding of real-time 5HT dynamics in these structures is lacking. We hypothesized that binge drinking would elicit brain-region specific dysfunction in 5HT dynamics during appetitive and aversive stimuli processing. Using fiber photometry with the GRAB5HT sensor, we identified distinct reward and aversion 5HT signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA. Consumption of alcohol and other tastants elicited a suppression of GRAB5HT signal in the ACC and an increase in 5HT signal in the CeA. In contrast, aversive stimuli similarly increased 5HT in both structures. The effect of binge drinking on 5HT function was surprisingly non-uniform, producing brain-region, sex-, and stimulus-specific dysfunction in 5HT signaling that dramatically shifted across weeks of alcohol experience. This suggests that adaptations in 5HT signaling are specific to neural circuits underlying discrete functions. Optogenetically stimulating 5HT terminals in the ACC and CeA increased avoidance behavior without being overtly rewarding or aversive, and stimulating 5HT release in the ACC blunted alcohol drinking. Together, these data identify distinct 5HT reward and aversion signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA and highlight early binge drinking as a critical stage of 5HT adaptation and a potential window for therapeutic intervention.",

      "title": "Motor unit behaviour adaptations across the lifespan: sex differences in young, middle-aged and old adults",
      "content": "Ageing is associated with neuromuscular decline, and emerging evidence suggests that sex may influence the time course of motor unit adaptations. This study examined age- and sex-related differences in motor unit firing behaviour across young (YG), middle-aged (MA), and older adults (OLD), by integrating high-density EMG motor unit analysis with muscle morphology and daily physical activity measurements. The analysis of single motor unit activity during submaximal isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis revealed that older adults had lower firing rates and a reduced capacity to modulate discharge frequency during force-increasing contractions. In the YG and MA groups, females showed higher motor unit firing rates and variability than males, while in OLD these sex differences were no longer present. Females also demonstrated a steeper decline in firing rate modulation between MA and OLD. Reductions in muscle cross-sectional area and thickness were similar between sexes. Physical activity levels declined with age in both sexes. These findings reveal distinct, sex-specific trajectories of neuromuscular ageing, with females showing greater motor neuron function decline between MA and OLD, in the absence of sex-related differences in the rate of morphological deterioration. The attenuation of sex differences in older age suggests a convergence of neuromuscular profiles with ageing. While physical activity may contribute to the observed sex-specific patterns, other mechanisms related to hormonal shifts warrant further investigation. These insights underscore the importance of considering age and sex in the study of motor control and in the development of targeted interventions to preserve muscle function across the lifespan.",
