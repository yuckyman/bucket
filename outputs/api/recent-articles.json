      "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

      "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
      "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

      "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

      "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
      "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

      "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
      "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "content": "IntroductionIdentifying brain topology alterations in chronic pain is a crucial step in understanding its pathophysiology. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess alterations in resting-state functional and structural global network properties in patients with chronic pain.MethodsFollowing the preregistration (PROSPERO CRD42024542390), databases were searched for studies comparing connectivity-based whole-brain global network properties between patients with chronic pain and healthy controls. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for each global network property separately.ResultsA total of 32 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies were included in the qualitative review, with 27 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies eligible for meta-analysis across nine unique structural and functional global network properties. The number of participants per meta-analysis ranged from 178 to 1,592. There was low-certainty evidence that chronic pain patients showed impairments in local efficiency of resting-state functional whole-brain topology (SMD: \u22120.50, 95%-CI: \u22120.81 to \u22120.19, 95%-PI: \u22121.38 to 0.38), and low to very low-certainty evidence that structural whole-brain topology was not altered in chronic pain across nine global network properties. The heterogeneity was high in the majority of functional (I2: 1\u201376%) and structural (I2: 68\u201397%) topology studies. Most functional (50%) and structural (65%) topology studies showed some concern regarding the risk of bias.DiscussionThe meta-analyses indicate that functional but not structural whole-brain topological reorganisation is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain.",

      "content": "AimThis study adopted Rasch Analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties of the neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA) in high-risk full-term infants during their NICU stay.MethodsA total of 543 full-term infants (14.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.02\u202fdays of age) were included in the study. We used the Rasch Model (RM) to assess the reliability and validity of the NBNA and GPCMlasso models to examine differential item functioning (DIF).ResultsThe samples responded to the NBNA according to the Rasch Model pattern. We found that the NBNA measures neurobehavior with one extra component regarding visual reactions. We found items that displayed disorder category functions in the NBNA. Conservatively, we found that the participants\u2019 responses to the NBNA items were mostly dependent on the neurological developmental level, regardless of demographic traits.ConclusionOur results support the applicability of the NBNA in depicting neurobehaviors in high-risk full-term infants in NICU. We found that high-risk infants could respond to NBNA items that were mostly dependent on the neural developmental level. The category functioning analysis revealed that the items provided inaccurate information owing to the disordered rating design.",

      "title": "Finite element analysis of a neural implant for cytostatic hypothermia and a novel heat management system",
      "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

      "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
      "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

      "title": "Foundation models for EEG decoding: current progress and prospective research",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",
