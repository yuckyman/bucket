Hoping to share the <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">release of Pact Python v3</a> that has been a long time coming \ud83d\ude05</p> <hr /> <p>It's been a couple of months since we released Pact Python v3, and after ironing out a couple of early issues, I think it's finally time to reflect on this milestone and its implications. This post is a look back at the journey, some of the challenges, the people, and the future of this project within the Pact ecosystem.</p> <p>Pact is an approach to contract testing that sits neatly between traditional unit tests (which check individual components) and end-to-end tests (which exercise the whole system). With Pact, you can verify that your services communicate correctly, without needing to spin up every dependency. By capturing the expected interactions between consumer and provider, Pact allows you to test each side in isolation and replay those interactions, giving you fast, reliable feedback and confidence that your APIs and microservices will work together in the real world. Pact Python brings this powerful workflow to the Python ecosystem, making it easy to test everything from REST APIs to event-driven systems.</p> <hr /> <p>You can read the rest of the announcement <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/blog/2025/12/04/announcing-pact-python-v3/\">here</a> and check out <a href=\"https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-python/\">Pact Python</a>.</p> <p>If you have any questions, let me know \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JP-Ellis\"> /u/JP-Ellis </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pefrdj/announcing_pact_python_v3/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I recently caught 2 cases, 1 criminal and 1 civil and I realized how incredibly difficult it is for the average person to find a suitable lawyer for their specific situation. There's two ways the average person look for a lawyer, a simple google search based on SEO ( google doesn't know to rank attorneys ) or through connections, which is basically flying blind. Trying to navigate court systems to actually see an attorney\u2019s track record is a nightmare, the portals are clunky, slow, and often require manual searching case-by-case, it's as if it's built by people who DOESN'T want you to use their system.</p> <p>So, I built CourtScrapper to fix this.</p> <p>It\u2019s an open-source Python tool that automates extracting case information from the Dallas County Courts Portal (with plans to expand). It lets you essentially &quot;background check&quot; an attorney's actual case history to see what they\u2019ve handled and how it went.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <ul> <li>Multi-Attorney Search: You can input a list of attorneys and it searches them all concurrently.</li> <li>Deep Filtering: Filters by case type (e.g., Felony), charge keywords (e.g., &quot;Assault&quot;, &quot;Theft&quot;), and date ranges.</li> <li>Captcha Handling: Automatically handles the court\u2019s captchas using 2Captcha (or manual input if you prefer).</li> <li>Data Export: Dumps everything into clean Excel/CSV/JSON files so you can actually analyze the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li>The average person who is looking for a lawyer that makes sense for their particular situation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Enterprise software that has API connections to state courts e.g. lexus nexus, west law </li> </ul> <p><strong>The Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Playwright (for browser automation/stealth)</li> <li>Pandas (for data formatting)</li> </ul> <p><strong>My personal use case:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Gather a list of attorneys I found through google</li> <li>Adjust the values in the config file to determine the cases to be scraped</li> <li>Program generates the excel sheet with the cases for the listed attorneys</li> <li>I personally go through each case to determine if I should consider it for my particular situation</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019d love for you guys to roast my code or give me some feedback. I\u2019m looking to make this more robust and potentially support more counties.</p> <p>Repo here:<a href=\"https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper\">https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlikely90\"> /u/Unlikely90 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Ventromedial striatal dopamine dynamically integrates motivated action and reward proximity",
      "content": "Dopamine release in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) both invigorates actions and encodes reward-related information, yet how these functions are integrated remains under active debate. To investigate this further, we designed four different versions of a rat Go/No-go task, where we systematically manipulated response requirements, temporal task demands, and controllability of reward pursuit. Dopamine release increased reliably during action initiation (Go) but was delayed during action suppression (No-go), and was insensitive to augmented response demands or controllability. Following response completion, dopamine rose gradually until animals arrived at the reward location, irrespective of reward-delivery timing, prior action demands, or controllability. This proximity dopamine-signal was exaggerated after animals exhibited Pavlovian consummatory behavior during No-go trials, revealing a motivational signal component. Together, these findings indicate that in reward contexts, VMS-dopamine signals successively integrate the invigoration of action initiation with the continuous estimation of spatial - but not temporal - proximity to rewards.",
