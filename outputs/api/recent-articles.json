      "title": "Actigraphy-Based Movement Profiles and Their Association with Circadian Rhythms Integrity in Real-World Settings",
      "content": "Both active movement profiles and robust circadian rhythms are linked to improved health outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms remain partially understood. We investigated this relationship in young adults (n = 169, aged 18-30 years) under real-world conditions using actigraphy data. We performed k-means clustering on 12 accelerometer-based features capturing magnitude, duration, frequency, and intensity distribution to derive movement behavior profiles. As a proxy of circadian rhythms integrity we computed the Circadian Function Index (CFI), which combines intradaily variability, interdaily stability, and relative amplitude. We also assessed circadian phase and sleep quality parameters. Additionally, we quantified light exposure and physical activity over 3-hour daily intervals. The unsupervised algorithm identified two non-overlapping profiles among participants, the More Active (MA) and the Less Active (LA) profiles. MA exhibited a higher CFI (0.81 {+/-} 0.06 vs. 0.69 {+/-} 0.06, p <0.001), which was also positively associated with early-evening physical activity, but not with light exposure. MA also showed an earlier circadian phase, estimated as the midpoint of the five least active hours (L5c, 04:30 {+/-} 01:03 vs. 04:59 {+/-} 01:15, p = 0.006), which was inversely associated with early-morning physical activity and late-morning light exposure. We found no differences in sleep quality between MA and LA. Our results emphasize the influence of light exposure and physical activity timing on circadian phase, and underscore the association between movement behavior and overall circadian rhythms integrity. Importantly, these findings reinforce actigraphy as a multidimensional tool for both health research and clinical applications.",

      "title": "Changes in aperiodic (1/f slope) activity during a picture-word interference task: Effects of congruency and sequence manipulations",
      "content": "Aperiodic neural activity (1/f EEG) has been proposed to reflect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E:I) inputs, with steeper spectral slopes reflecting increased inhibition and flatter slopes indicating excitation. This activity also reflects the temporal coordination of neural firing, offering insights into fundamental brain dynamics. Recent studies have shown that the 1/f slope is sensitive to stimulus onset, characterized by initial inhibitory shifts followed by excitatory rebounds, which may reflect cognitive control mechanisms involved in suppressing distractions and preparing goal-directed responses. However, previous works have relied on fixed temporal windows and insufficient control of ERP contamination, limiting our understanding of rapid control dynamics. Here we used newly developed time-resolved analyses to study 1/f spectral slope modulation during a Picture-Word Interference task, focusing on two canonical cognitive control markers: the Congruency Effect (CE) and Congruency Sequence Effect (CSE). Forty-nine participants categorized pictures while ignoring congruent or incongruent words. Behaviorally, we replicated robust CE and CSE patterns. Spectral slope analyses showed that incongruent trials elicited steeper slopes - consistent with increased inhibition - particularly in frontal and central regions, reflecting conflict-related control engagement. Moreover, CSE analyses revealed dynamic slope modulations across frontal, central, and occipital components over time, suggesting control adjustments influenced by previous trial congruency. These results provide the first fine-grained evidence that aperiodic 1/f EEG activity can track both immediate conflict resolution and cognitive adjustments, offering a temporally sensitive neural marker of cognitive control through modulation of E:I balance.",

      "title": "Spacing effect improves generalization in biological and artificial systems",
      "content": "Generalization is a fundamental criterion for evaluating learning effectiveness, a domain where biological intelligence excels yet artificial intelligence continues to face challenges. In biological learning and memory, the well-documented spacing effect shows that appropriately spaced intervals between learning trials can significantly improve behavioral performance. While multiple theories have been proposed to explain its underlying mechanisms, one compelling hypothesis is that spaced training promotes integration of input and innate variations, thereby enhancing generalization to novel but related scenarios. Here we examine this hypothesis by introducing a bio-inspired spacing effect into artificial neural networks, integrating input and innate variations across spaced intervals at the neuronal, synaptic, and network levels. These spaced ensemble strategies yield significant performance gains across various benchmark datasets and network architectures. Biological experiments on Drosophila further validate the complementary effect of appropriate variations and spaced intervals in improving generalization, which together reveal a convergent computational principle shared by biological learning and machine learning.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
