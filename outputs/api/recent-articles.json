      "title": "Attentional responses to the color exposure sequence of landscape paintings: evidence from fNIRS and eye-tracking",
      "content": "IntroductionColor is a critical determinant of esthetic experience, shaping both immersion and cognitive responses. However, the extent to which the sequence of color exposure modulates the interplay between neural activation and ocular behavior remains insufficiently understood.MethodsTen chromatic landscape paintings were collected and converted into achromatic versions, yielding a total of 20 visual stimuli. Participants were assigned to two conditions: Condition A (achromatic to chromatic) and Condition B (chromatic to achromatic). Visual attention and prefrontal activation were assessed using eye-tracking techniques and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.ResultsAnalyses revealed significantly greater neural activation in Condition A within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.006), left orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043), and right orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043). Eye-tracking metrics indicated longer Total duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.015), Maximum duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.036), and Total duration of whole fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.025) under Condition A. Subjective evaluations also showed significant differences, with higher ratings for Match (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.005) and Feel (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.029).DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that color stimuli exert a decisive influence not only on subjective immersion but also on objective neurocognitive processes. The study extends the scientific foundation of empirical esthetics and offers novel implications for the design of museum and exhibition environments.",

      "title": "Preliminary ERP evidence of the impact of loneliness on Stroop interference for socio-emotional stimuli",
      "content": "Growing evidence highlights the adverse clinical effects and societal implications of loneliness, i.e., the negative feeling associated with a perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social connections. To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo explore the risk factors of cognitive dysfunction in patients with leukoaraiosis (LA) and to construct a predictive model using machine learning.MethodsA total of 273 patients with LA were included. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The patients were divided into a training set (191 cases) and a validation set (82 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Seven machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, GBDT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) were employed to construct predictive models. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall, F1 score, MCC, AUROC, and SHAP was used for model interpretation.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, CRP, Fazekas score, and IASA score were associated with cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, Fazekas score, and IASA score were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an AUROC of 0.8373 for the validation set. SHAP analysis indicated that age, LDL-C, IASA score, and Fazekas score were the most important predictors.ConclusionThe Random Forest model can be used to predict the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with LA, providing a reference for early warning.",

      "content": "Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic secondary headache disorder that develops from excessive analgesic use. The prevalence of MOH is estimated 1\u20132% in the general population, reaching up to 50% among individuals with chronic headache. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MOH remain incompletely understood, neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into its developments. This review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that MOH is associated with structural and functional alterations in two key neural systems: (1) the pain matrix involved in nociceptive processing, (2) the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry implicated in addictive behaviors. Importantly, certain structural and functional changes show partial reversibility following medication withdrawal. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to establish causal relationships between these neurobiological changes and the development/maintenance of MOH, which remains essential for developing targeted interventions.",

      "title": "Development of a non-human primate model for preclinical research of a novel auditory nerve implant",
      "content": "The cochlear implant is a widely available hearing restoration technology that can provide speech understanding in quiet environments. This technology struggles however, in noisy settings or situations involving multiple speakers. The primary cause of these performance limitations is a poor neural interface, in which the bony wall of the cochlea separates the electrode surface from the auditory nerve fibers, thus causing unwanted current spread and non-specific frequency activation. This study utilizes an alternative auditory prosthetic technology (auditory nerve implant, ANI) that enables direct auditory nerve stimulation, which provides a potentially superior neural interface and enables more precise targeting of auditory nerve fibers than traditional cochlear implants. As auditory nerve implants progress towards clinical translation, new implant designs and stimulation strategies will be created. Animal models to efficiently test and iterate through these new designs will be useful for the continued development of ANI technology. We present a viable surgical approach in the non-human primate (rhesus macaque) along with electrophysiological results that demonstrate robust activation of the auditory system at low current levels via intraneural stimulation. Our findings indicate that the rhesus macaque, which possesses an inner ear anatomy more similar to the human compared to other animal models used in the hearing field (e.g., rodents, felines and ferrets), has strong potential as a useful preclinical testbed involving an upright head model for future ANI prototypes and stimulation strategy development.",

      "content": "BackgroundThis study investigated the brain functional characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain (NP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).MethodsA total of 35 subjects were enrolled, including 10 able-bodied controls, 12 patients with SCI and NP (SCI-NP), and 13 patients with SCI (without NP). fNIRS was used to detected blood oxygen signals during motor tasks and resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in the subjects. We also performed Pearson correlation analyses of pain scores (NPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in patients with SCI-NP. Statistical analyses were performed using Shapiro-Wilk test for normality; paired t-test for intra-group differences; ANOVA (LSD post-hoc, Bonferroni-corrected) for multi-group comparisons; Cohen's d/partial \u03b72 for effect size; independent samples t-test (FDR-corrected) for inter-group FC differences.ResultsDuring the task state, patients with SCI-NP activated bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1, L/R P = 0.044/0.032), bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA, L/R P = 0.041/0.037), right primary motor cortex and left parietal lobe (LPL, P = 0.047). Hemodynamic changes in the bilateral S1, secondary somatosensory cortex, SMA, and right prefrontal cortex of patients with SCI-NP were significantly stronger than those in the other two groups. During RS, the whole-brain and most inter/intra-regional FC strength trended able-bodied controls > patients with SCI > patients with SCI-NP. NPS strongly correlated with LPL (r = 0.977, P = 0.004); PSQI correlated with motor cortex HbO changes (r = 0.889\u22120.975, P = 0.005\u22120.043).ConclusionPatients with SCI-NP exhibit significant abnormal cerebral cortical excitation and reduced FC. HbO is a potential biomarker for evaluating NP. fNIRS supports objective assessment of SCI-NP and rehabilitation strategy formulation [ChiCTR2500097098].",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",
