      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Neuronal effects of epicranial current stimulation in macaque cortex",
      "content": "BackgroundTranscranial electrical stimulation (TES) using scalp electrodes is noninvasive, safe and inexpensive. However, because the scalp shunts most of the current, electric fields (E-fields) in the brain are relatively weak. Conversely, invasive neuromodulation methods such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and invasive cortical stimulation (ICS) successfully treat many brain diseases. However, the expensive and risky surgery limits the reach of these approaches. Epicranial current stimulation (ECS), where electrodes are implanted on the skull, is a novel approach which can bridge the gap between these two extremes. In current study we investigated the effects of ECS on neural activity.MethodsIn two macaque monkeys we implanted two concentric ring electrodes directly on the skull. Each electrode targeted one area PFG (PFG is not an acronym; rather it is the full name of a particular part of the parietal cortex) of the parietal convexity. Furthermore, a craniotomy was drilled in the skull to access the same area PFG. While recording (2\u202fmin) we stimulated (during the second recording minute) with a 10 or 40\u202fHz sinewave using an unfocused montage (between two electrodes on each side of the head) or a focused (through the concentric electrodes) over an intensity range of 0.25 to 4\u202fmA. These two montages allowed us to investigate neural responses to targeted and broad brain stimulation. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment we stimulated, at only 10\u202fHz, through an unfocused montage.ResultsOur results show that E-field strengths depended on a combination of montage and stimulation intensity. Depending on the montage stimulation caused entrainment as well as spike rate increases. For focused stimulation and unfocused stimulation at lower amplitudes neural activity became entrained to the stimulation (similar to TES). For the unfocused stimulation, as stimulation amplitude increased, spike-rates also increased (similar to ICS and DBS) while the unfocused did not affect spike rates. The fMRI study showed a distributed pattern of activations which is suggestive of a network response caused by ECS.ConclusionECS has been used as a proxy for transcutaneous stimulation in rodent setups. Here we show that as a standalone technique it can be applied to a larger and more complex brain. This makes it a promising neuromodulation approach with clinical applications in patients who do not respond to TES but are not yet candidates for ICS or DBS.",

      "content": "IntroductionClinical studies assessing cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases require endpoints that are sensitive to treatment response across a broad range of cognitive abilities. However, responsiveness of conventional cognitive assessments typically varies with the performance level, especially due to non-linearities such as floor or ceiling effects. Here, we evaluate 6 newly developed smartphone-based and gamified Adaptive Cognitive Assessments (ACAs) entailing a system of dynamic difficulty adaptation to individual performance, which is expected to improve adherence but also measurement properties. Deployment of such ACAs to maximize their discriminative ability in comparative studies requires exploration of many free parameters and complex dynamics.MethodsIn simulations of cohorts of patients with cognitive impairment, we compared two ACAs paradigms: after 14 daily tests allowing performance-based difficulty adaptation, the difficulty level was either (1) fixed or (2) kept adaptive for a period of 4\u202fyears with weekly testing. Sensitivity to between-group effects was assessed in cohorts characterized by cognitive decline observed in neurodegenerative diseases.ResultsThe discriminative ability of the two paradigms depends on features of the study design and subjects. At study end, the adaptive difficulty paradigm clearly outperformed the fixed-difficulty paradigm in terms of responsiveness for cognitive decline rates >2.5% per year.DiscussionACA can increase biomarker responsiveness to treatment effects over fixed difficulty. ACA deployment should be guided by study and assessment features, including duration, expected cognitive decline rates and effect size. In the high-dimensional parameter space of ACA instruments, study simulations are indispensable to identify suitable deployment strategies.",

      "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
      "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

      "title": "Motor unit number estimation based on convolutional neural network",
      "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

      "title": "Feature fusion based on global-local weighted attention model for automatic epileptic seizure detection",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",
