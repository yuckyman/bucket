Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, ScreenLungNet, a 3-year lung cancer risk prediction model, was developed using LDCT data from the Wenling 2019-2020 screening cohort...",

Although the effect appears most pronounced during the first postoperative week, this short-term benefit may be clinically relevant, particularly for patients with premium intraocular lens or those who rely heavily on low-light vision.",

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are widely used to diagnose pediatric pneumonia; however, distinguishing between bacterial and viral etiologies on imaging is a diagnostically challenging task. Large language models (LLMs), particularly those integrated with vision capabilities, have shown promise in preliminary studies for interpreting CXR findings. However, the diagnostic performance of general-purpose...",
