      "title": "Distinct spatial distribution of potentiated dendritic spines in encoding- and recall-activated hippocampal neurons",
      "content": "Experimental advancements in neuroscience have identified cellular engrams - ensembles of neurons whose activation is necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval. Synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, is key to memory encoding and recall, but the relationship between learning-induced dendritic spine potentiation and neuron-wide activation remains unclear. Here, we employ a post-synaptic translation-dependent potentiation reporter (SA-PSD{Delta}Venus) and a neuronal activation reporter (ESARE-dTurquoise) to determine their spatiotemporal correlation in the mouse hippocampal CA1 following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Potentiated spines were enriched in activated neurons, with distribution varying across CA1 layers at different phases of memory: potentiated spines were more frequent in activated neurons in stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare after CFC (encoding), while recall-activated neurons showed a larger number of potentiated spines in the stratum radiatum. These findings demonstrate that the relative weight and spatial distribution of potentiated synaptic inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons changes between the encoding and retrieval phases of memory.",

      "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
      "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

      "title": "Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Enhances Ca2+-Dependent Electrical Activity in Lateral Cochlear Efferents",
      "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>",

      "title": "Motor Control Processes Moderate Visual Working Memory Gating",
      "content": "<p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<sub>0</sub>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>",

      "title": "Superior Colliculus Projections Drive Dopamine Neuron Activity and Movement But Not Value",
      "content": "<p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>",

It automatically handles the conversion to and from the open-inference protocol format. </p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Python-based open-inference clients; production ready, but with limited features for now (e.g., no async/auth support).</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/open-inference-openapi/\">open-inference-openapi</a> is also an open-inference client, but inference calls are made using the raw open-inference format, whereas my project wraps the whole interface in a `RemoteModel` class which corresponds to a single model residing in the server, with inputs/outputs defined using pydantic models. My project is thus on a higher level of abstraction, wrapping the open-inference calls.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bunny-therapy\"> /u/bunny-therapy </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1djcs/project_pydanticopeninference/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1djcs/project_pydanticopeninference/\">[comments]</a></span>",
