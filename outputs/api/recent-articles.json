      "title": "Direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed and its implications for robot motion design",
      "content": "Humans frequently interact with robots that approach from different directions; however, how the approach direction systematically biases the perceived speed remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a robust direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed, whereby objects approaching from behind are consistently perceived as moving faster than those approaching from the front are. Across five experiments using both physical robots and immersive virtual reality, this bias manifests as a systematic shift in the point of subjective equality without corresponding changes in discrimination sensitivity, indicating a perceptual bias rather than altered precision. We further show that this effect can be explained by body-induced differences in interocular velocity that arise when observers orient themselves toward stimuli approaching from behind. This bias persists in virtual environments and for nonrobotic objects, suggesting that it is driven primarily by visual factors rather than multisensory cues or robot-specific appearance. Together, these findings provide a perceptual foundation for incorporating approach direction into the design and evaluation of the motion behavior of robots in human-centered environments.",

      "title": "Differential TDP-43 interactomes between the cortex and cerebellum in the mouse",
      "content": "TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the core pathogenic protein across a spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, but its pathological deposition shows regional selectivity, with abundant TDP-43 positive aggregates in the frontal cortex and spinal cord, and a much lower burden in the cerebellum. In health, TDP-43 expression in the cerebellum is higher than in cortex, hence what underpins this differential vulnerability to TDP-43 aggregation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in healthy C57Bl/6J mice not only is TDP-43 expression higher in the cerebellum than the cortex, but that this expression difference is driven primarily by differences in cytoplasmic load. Mass spectrometry analysis of TDP-43 pull downs from the cortex and cerebellum of healthy mice identified TDP-43 interactors across a number of core functional pathways, with numerous differences between the two brain regions. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD062532. Notably, there were more interactors identified in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions within the cortex than the cerebellum. Putative interactions with four core paraspeckle proteins; SFPQ, NONO, FUS and PSPC1 were confirmed using immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Follow up validation using proximity ligation assay showed abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic interactions between TDP-43 and all four paraspeckle proteins in both large motor cortex neurons and purkinje cells, with significantly reduced nuclear interactions detected in the motor cortex for SFPQ, FUS and PSPC1. These findings suggest that TDP-43-protein interactions markedly differ between the TDP-43 pathogenesis vulnerable cortex and relatively resistant cerebellum and exploring these differences may yield new insight into disease mechanisms within ALS/FTD.",

      "title": "Simultaneous Real-time Imaging of Neurofluid and Neurovascular Dynamics Using Ultrafast Flow-weighted Echo-Planar Imaging",
      "content": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is tightly coupled to cerebral blood flow under the fixed-volume constraint of the cranial vault, with cardiac pulsations and respiration acting as dominant physiological drivers. Disruption of these flow dynamics has been implicated in various neurological disorders, motivating the need for imaging methods that capture CSF and vascular flow simultaneously and in real time. Conventional phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) provides quantitative CSF velocity measurements but relies on cardiac gating and velocity encoding, which limit temporal resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity to non-cardiac fluctuations. Here, we introduce self-gated ultrafast real-time flow-weighted echo-planar imaging (SURF-EPI), an inflow-weighted approach in which signal intensity reflects the replacement of saturated spins by freshly inflowing, unsaturated water molecules, yielding higher signal with higher flow. This allows simultaneous assessment of arterial inflow, venous outflow, and CSF motion at high temporal resolution. SURF-EPI was acquired at the C2-C3 spinal level, enabling real-time imaging of CSF flow dynamics in the cervical spinal canal alongside arterial and venous blood flow in major cervical vessels (frame-rate: 21.7 Hz). In addition to frequency-domain analyses, we leveraged intrinsic arterial signal fluctuations as a timing reference to reconstruct cardiac-resolved CSF dynamics for individual cardiac cycles without external physiological recordings. Frequency-domain analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures in CSF flow compared with neurovascular flow, including broadened cardiac peaks and enhanced respiratory modulation, particularly within the ventral spinal canal. In contrast, dorsal CSF showed increased power within the cardiac frequency band, higher coherence with cervical vasculature at the cardiac frequency, and reduced non-cardiac contributions. Time-domain analysis showed strong correlation between CSF flow waveforms derived from SURF-EPI and PC-MRI. Beyond ensemble-averaged waveforms, SURF-EPI enabled beat-to-beat analysis, revealing substantial cycle-to-cycle variability in CSF flow that is not captured by time-averaged gated approaches. Together, these findings establish SURF-EPI as a rapid, complementary framework to PC-MRI, enabling real-time neurofluid imaging with integrated time- and frequency-domain characterization of CSF and neurovascular flow dynamics.",

      "title": "A generalized scaling law to characterize coordinated brain activity",
      "content": "Complex ecological systems obey universal scaling laws such as the Taylor law, which links population variance to the sample mean. A natural question is whether other complex systems with integrated and segregated functional networks, such as the human brain, follow analogous scaling laws, and how these laws behave under synchronized activity. Addressing this is challenging because neural signals at all measurement scales contain both positive and negative values, whereas the Taylor law was developed for non-negative ecological data. To overcome this limitation, we replace the sample mean with the root mean square (RMS) of detrended neural activity and formulate a generalized spatial scaling law applicable to signed data. This framework extends spatial scaling obeying the Taylor law to neural systems and other complex systems across disciplines and allows examination of how coordinated, synchronized activity shapes these laws. Synchrony is quantified using a dedicated metric of functional coordination. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations using multivariate Poisson, binomial, uniform, and gamma distributions demonstrate that the scaling exponent is inversely related to synchrony. Applying this framework to human fMRI data from three large lifespan cohorts (N=840, ages 18 to 88) reveals distinct age-associated trajectories of the scaling exponent. Healthy aging is characterized by a substantial synchrony-induced reduction in the exponent. The synchrony and scaling relationship is stable during resting-state activity but progressively shifts during naturalistic tasks across the lifespan. Limbic, subcortical, and cerebellar regions show particularly strong synchrony and scaling coupling, indicating preservation at subnetwork levels. Finally, individuals with ADHD exhibit disrupted synchrony and scaling relationships, underscoring the potential clinical utility of this novel metric.",

      "title": "A sensorimotor brain circuit for transforming aversive experiences into emotional states",
      "content": "Innately aversive experiences produce emotional states which control behavior as well as long term associative memories1-3. Brainstem regions engage innate defensive reactions1,3-7, but it is unclear how the nervous system transduces external aversive experiences into higher order, emotional representations in the forebrain to instruct learning and modulate behavior. The prevailing view is that the sensory properties of aversive experiences activate forebrain emotional processing1,3,8-10, but classical theories proposed that internal bodily reactions to unpleasant events produce feeling states11,12. Here we identify a brainstem cuneiform (CnF) circuit which conveys information about both the external sensory causes and internal motor reactions related to aversive events to the lateral/basal nuclei of the amygdala (LA/B), a brain region which stores emotional memories, to enhance ongoing defensive behaviors and regulate associative memory formation. Glutamatergic CnF neurons project directly to LA/B and receive afferent inputs from aversive-sensory and aversive-motor brain regions. Notably, LA/B neurons encode a sensorimotor state in response to noxious stimuli, with both sensory and motor features transmitted through the CnF-to-LA/B pathway. Finally, optogenetic perturbation experiments showed that during aversive experiences, the CnF-LA/B circuit instructs emotional memory formation and enhances the intensity of ongoing defensive behaviors. These findings reveal how the nervous system constructs an aversive sensorimotor state in the amygdala used for regulating the strength of emotional behaviors and producing memory formation. This demonstrates a clinically relevant brain mechanism for the regulation of emotional processing by both external traumatic events and the accompanying bodily reactions.",

      "title": "Respiratory suppression enhances voluntary control of human action",
      "content": "Athletes often regulate their breathing to optimize motor performance, suggesting a close link between respiration and movement control. Previous studies have shown that respiration modulates neuronal oscillations and influences behavior. However, how respiratory control directly affects motor behavior remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that breath holding during the preparatory period facilitates voluntary movement. We examined respiratory patterns while participants performed two types of eye movement tasks: pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks. In the anti-saccade task, participants were required to suppress a reflexive saccade toward a visual target and instead generate a voluntary saccade in the opposite direction. To assess whether motivation modulates respiratory control, the tasks were conducted under two motivational conditions. Most participants suppressed their breath during the anticipatory period preceding saccade initiation, regardless of task type, and this tendency was more pronounced under high motivation. In the anti-saccade task, stronger respiratory adjustments were associated with shorter reaction times, whereas no such relationship was observed in the pro-saccade task. Moreover, intentional breath holding during the preparatory period selectively reduced reaction times in the anti-saccade task. These findings indicate that individuals spontaneously hold their breath to facilitate voluntary actions in highly motivated situations, and that this effect can be reproduced through intentional breath holding. We propose that anticipatory breath holding may play a functional role in proactively modulating neural processes underlying voluntary movement control.",

      "title": "THIK-1 channel mediates microglial glucose sensing and modulates AgRP neurons",
      "content": "Microglia play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction contributes to metabolic disease. Although high-fat diet (HFD) exposure induces microglial activation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized role for THIK-1 channel in mediating glucose sensing of microglia in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), during HFD-induced obesity. Pharmacological inhibition of THIK-1 channel with tetrapentylammonium (TPA) suppresses feeding and attenuates body-weight gain in diet induced obese mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons is indispensable for TPA-induced hypophagia. Moreover, THIK-1 inhibition promotes microglial phagocytosis of perineuronal nets (PNNs), leading to reduced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding suppression. Together, these findings establish THIK-1 as a critical glucose sensor in hypothalamic microglia and uncover a microglia-dependent pathway through which overnutrition modulates AgRP neuronal activity via PNN remodeling to regulate energy balance, highlighting THIK-1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diet-induced obesity.",

      "title": "Reliability and validity of multi-band multi-echo fMRI",
      "content": "Precision mapping of individual differences in human brain spontaneous activity is critical for characterizing brain function and guiding clinical translation. Multi-echo resting-state functional MRI (ME-rfMRI) has the potential to provide more reliable mapping of inter-individual differences in intrinsic brain function than conventional single-echo rfMRI (SE-rfMRI). However, the psychometric benefits of ME-rfMRI for mapping individual differences in spontaneous brain activity (SBA) have not been systematically investigated, which is fundamental for understanding the human brain in health and disease. To quantify the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI in precisely mapping inter-individual variations in SBA, we employed a psychometric design. We scanned 27 healthy adults with both ME-rfMRI and SE-rfMRI to assess short-term (minutes) test-retest reliability, as well as validity across eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states. Our results demonstrate that ME-rfMRI improves reliability relative to SE-rfMRI by 10.8% for amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), 4.4% for regional homogeneity (ReHo), and 8.0% for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in cortical regions, and by 12.5% for ALFF, 8.3% for ReHo, and 4.0% for VMHC in subcortical regions. This enhancement is achieved by increasing inter-individual variability while reducing intra-individual variability. Notably, ME-rfMRI accentuates inter-individual variability in the unimodal cortex and clearly delineates two parallel systems with distinct variability patterns within the motor cortex. Concurrently, ME-rfMRI increases effect sizes (4%-8%) for detecting individual differences between EO and EC resting states. Interestingly, ME-rfMRI reveals differential effects of eye closure on two intertwined systems in the primary motor and sensory cortices, extending previous findings. Computational simulations indicate that, compared to SE-rfMRI, ME-rfMRI facilitates experimental designs with reduced costs (i.e., 4%-11% smaller sample sizes) for precise mapping of individual differences. These findings establish, for the first time, the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI measurements, supporting its potential utility in personalized neuroscience applications, including neurodevelopment and brain disorders.",

      "content": "Precise, dynamic control of metabolic fuel usage in response to environmental challenges such as altered food availability or temperature change is essential for animal survival. In mammals, metabolic flexibility -- the capacity to shift cellular metabolism between carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation -- is understood to be largely regulated by circulating hormones such as insulin and glucagon. However, the role of the central nervous system in coordinating fuel selection and tissue metabolic tuning remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that mediate metabolic reprogramming following the acute activation of torpor-associated glutamatergic Adcyap1+ torpor-regulating neurons in the anteroventral preoptic area (avPOAVglut2/PACAP). The activation of these neurons rapidly shifts whole-body fuel use from glucose to fatty acids, irrespective of fuel/food availability. This shift is associated with reduced glucose utilization stemming from the transient induction of selective insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We find that this reduction in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism does not require direct muscle innervation but is rather mediated via adrenal hormones. In contrast to their activation, avPOAVglut2/PACAP neuronal silencing results in improved glucose tolerance, demonstrating powerful bidirectional control of tissue-specific glucose metabolism, whole-body glucose levels, and fuel usage. Together, our findings uncover a novel POA-adrenal-skeletal muscle pathway that dynamically controls glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility.",

      "content": "Zone-like states, defined as high objective performance with low subjective workload, are sought in esports and other demanding digital activities, yet subjective flow does not consistently index efficient performance. We hypothesized that zone-like high performance is supported by regulated arousal dynamics rather than strongly elevated arousal responses, and that such episodes can be detected from the combined dynamics of heart rate and pupil diameter. Fourteen healthy young adult men completed repeated sessions of a one-versus-one fighting game under three contexts: passive watching, play against a computer-controlled opponent, and competition against a human opponent. Heart rate and pupil diameter were recorded continuously, and subjective flow (Sports Flow Scale), subjective workload (NASA Task Load Index), and in-game performance metrics were assessed. Two-dimensional k-means clustering of heart rate and pupil changes relative to the watching condition revealed three arousal-reactivity profiles. Sessions with larger physiological deviations showed higher flow and higher workload but poorer performance. Sessions with smaller deviations showed higher performance with lower workload despite only moderate flow. Nonlinear analyses indicated inverted-U relationships between physiological deviations and performance, with peak performance occurring when heart rate and pupil responses remained close to the watching baseline during active play. These findings indicate that combined heart rate and pupillometry measures provide a useful multimodal physiological marker for identifying efficient high-performance states and for informing strategies to support performance while managing workload in cognitively demanding digital activities.",
