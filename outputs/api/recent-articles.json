      "title": "Retroreflective beam multiplexing enables high-throughput two-photon voltage imaging in vivo",
      "content": "Voltage imaging demands technical innovations to realize its full potential in neuroscience. Although two-photon microscopy is widely used in brain research, its imaging speed is insufficient for high-throughput voltage recordings. To overcome this limitation, we developed an all-optical beam multiplexing engine via retroreflection from two near-parallel mirrors. This approach integrates seamlessly with standard two-photon microscopes, enabling kilohertz-frame-rate imaging across a 16-fold expanded field of view while maintaining synaptic resolution. Operating at over 220 megapixels per second, it enables submillisecond imaging of dendritic propagation of action potentials and simultaneous voltage recording from more than 200 hippocampal neurons in head-fixed, behaving mice. This advancement unlocks new possibilities for large-scale, high-speed functional studies in neuroscience.",

      "title": "Reduction of A\u03b225-35-Induced Cognitive Impairments in C57BL/6 Mice Through Focused Ultrasound Thermal-Cycling Stimulation",
      "content": "Hyperthermia (HT) is recognized across various medical disciplines for its capacity to modulate specific protein expressions. In efforts to improve Alzheimer's disease (AD), HT has the potential to regulate heat shock proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant enzymes, which helps decrease the aberrant accumulation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) protein and oxidative stress. Nonetheless, the precise delivery of mild hyperthermia to the brain remains a significant challenge. To apply mild hyperthermia targeted to the brain and evaluate its impact on cognitive improvement, this study used focused ultrasound (FUS) to administer localized mild hyperthermia to the brains of AD mouse induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35. For considerations of safety and therapeutic efficacy, a thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) protocol was adapted into a focused ultrasound thermal-cycling stimulation (FUS-TCS), which was compared with the continuous focused ultrasound hyperthermia stimulation (FUS-HTS). The findings revealed that the FUS-TCS treatment group exhibited a significant improvement in cognitive performance, as evidenced by enhanced outcomes in the Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Furthermore, this group demonstrated increased expression of A{beta}-degrading enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). These results suggest that localized mild hyperthermia targeting the brain using FUS-TCS treatment represents a promising strategy for ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with AD.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
