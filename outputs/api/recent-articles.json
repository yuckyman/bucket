      "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

      "title": "Show HN: Krowdovi \u2013 Video-based indoor navigation on a DePIN creator economy",
      "content": "<p>What is this?<p>Krowdovi is an open-source platform that lets anyone with a smartphone record first-person navigation videos of indoor spaces - hospitals, airports, malls, universities - and earn tokens for helping others find their way around. It's built on Solana using a burn-and-mint DePIN model.The project addresses two problems:<p>Indoor navigation is still broken. 30% of first-time hospital visitors get lost or arrive late to appointments, costing large hospitals $200K-$500K annually in staff time. Existing solutions like Google Live View require pre-captured Street View data (which barely exists indoors), and enterprise tools charge $10K-$50K/year per venue.<p>Videographers are losing work to generative AI. Tools like Sora can generate synthetic video, but they can't walk through your hospital's actual layout or film your venue's real routes. There's an economic opportunity for creators to own location-based visual content that AI can't replicate.<p>How it works<p>For users: Scan a QR code at a venue entrance, watch a first-person video showing the route from where you are to your destination, with overlay graphics and multi-language support.<p>For creators: Record navigation videos on your phone, upload to the platform, earn reputation tiers (Bronze \u2192 Diamond) based on quality and views, get paid when users burn $FIND tokens to unlock your routes.<p>Token mechanics: Users burn $FIND tokens to mint \"credits\" that unlock videos. 75% of burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation, 25% goes to a remint pool that rewards creators. The smart contract on Solana handles burn-and-mint logic, reputation tracking, and distribution.<p>Everything is MIT licensed - fork it, the code is yours.<p>Why I built this<p>I care deeply about making the world accessible for all. If this gets forked someone executes fantastically to make the world a more accessible place for people who have visual or mobility impairments - sweet!<p>Technical stack<p>Smart Contracts: Rust/Anchor on Solana (burn-and-mint engine, reputation tiers, treasury management)\nBackend: Node.js/Express + Prisma/PostgreSQL (venue metadata, video uploads, JWT auth)<p>Frontend: Next.js 14 (Creator Studio, overlay tooling, wallet integration via @solana/wallet-adapter-react)<p>Designed to be hostable on Railway/Vercel with minimal devops. \nThe smart contract is on devnet - needs a security audit before mainnet, but you can test token burns/mints now.<p>Current limitations<p>What works: Smart contract deployed on devnet, full-stack app ready to deploy, video upload workflow, wallet authentication.<p>What doesn't: No real content yet (I need to film 10-20 venues), no mainnet token launch (waiting on security audit + demand validation), quality verification is manual, no mobile app (web-only).<p>Next steps: Deep soulful reflection on anti-gaming, moderation, ZK proofs<p>Try it yourself!<p>GitHub repo has setup instructions. You'll need Solana CLI, Node.js + pnpm, and a Solana wallet for devnet testing.Interested in forking for a different vertical, contributing code, testing by filming routes, or discussing token economics? I'm around to discuss in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "Dendritic excitations primarily mediate back-propagation in CA1 pyramidal neurons during behavior",
      "content": "Dendrites integrate synaptic inputs to trigger action potentials, and dendrites carry back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) to synapses where these signals contribute to plasticity. Despite strong evidence for a rich repertoire of nonlinear dendritic excitations, the in vivo roles of these excitations in dendritic integration and back-propagation remain uncertain. Here, we used high-speed voltage imaging through a chronically implanted microprism to map membrane potential dynamics from basal to apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. Despite complex dendritic branch morphology, the dynamics were largely captured by 2 or 3 electrical compartments: basal, soma, and apical. Fast dendritic spikes almost always started from bAPs, indicating that dendritic spikes are primarily a consequence rather than a cause of somatic spiking. These fast spikes sometimes triggered slower apical dendritic plateau depolarizations, which drove complex spikes at the soma. We found that the biophysics of dendritic excitability determined the distribution of simple and complex spikes across a place field. Our results show how CA1 pyramidal neurons convert synaptic inputs to spiking outputs and suggest a primary role of dendritic nonlinearities in mediating activity-dependent plasticity.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "A potential field shared control approach for wheelchair navigation via brain\u2013computer interface",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients with disabilities control external devices directly without peripheral pathways. Due to the limitations in EEG signal quality, the performance of EEG-based BCIs may not be satisfactory. Shared control has become an important research direction in the field of brain-controlled wheelchairs (BCWs). However, most existing studies do not achieve the flexible movement of BCW in environments with narrow spaces. This study proposes a shared controller based on the potential field method to integrate environmental information and user commands intelligently. Approach. Considering the flexibility of wheelchair movement, we incorporated EEG decoding results obtained through the motor imagery paradigm and fused them with environmental information to create a fusion field. We then used these components separately to construct the BCI and obstacle fields. Twelve subjects participated in the virtual wheelchair navigation experiment, while five subjects took part in the real-world wheelchair navigation experiment, aiming to evaluate the control performance in different scenarios under three control modes (keyboard, BCI-only, and shared control). Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed shared controller: 1) significantly enhances navigation performance in both general and narrow environments compared with BCI-only control; 2) improves the total success rate from 8.33% to 83.33% in virtual complex environments and from 23.33% to 66.67% in real-world two-way navigation; 3) achieves success rates that are statistically comparable to keyboard control (p > 0.05). Moreover, the shared control reduced the average navigation time by nearly 100 s compared with BCI-only control in real-world experiments. Significance. This new shared control method improves the ability of BCWs to move flexibly in challenging, narrow environments.",
