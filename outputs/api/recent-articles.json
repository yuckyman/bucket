      "title": "Intrinsic excitability of rat hippocampal granule cells increases along the dorsal-to-ventral axis",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus exhibits striking anatomical and functional heterogeneity along its dorsoventral axis, yet the intrinsic electrophysiological diversity of its principal excitatory neurons, the granule cells, across the dorsoventral axis remains unexplored. Here, we systematically examined the electrophysiological properties of DG granule cells across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral regions of the rat hippocampus. We found a progressive increase in input resistance, impedance amplitude, and firing rate of granule cells, accompanied by a gradual slowdown in repolarization kinetics of their action potentials along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Our analyses demonstrated that granule cells acted as class I integrators that lacked strong resonance properties across the dorsoventral axis. We performed pairwise correlation and dimensionality reduction analyses to reveal weak dependencies across physiological measurements and the absence of distinct clusters for dorsal, intermediate, or ventral granule cells. Importantly, blade-specific analyses of granule cell physiology revealed that all measurements manifested pronounced heterogeneities even within a given dorsoventral section and a specific blade. Strikingly, ventral granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade manifested higher firing rates compared to their counterparts in the suprapyramidal blade. These blade-specific differences were limited to the ventral granule cells, with negligible distinctions between granule cells in the two blades of either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus. Together, our findings unveil a progressive increase in excitability of DG granule cells along the dorsal-to-ventral axis and a blade-specific granularity of firing properties, adding new dimensions to the several known anatomical, molecular, and behavioral differences across the hippocampal dorsoventral axis.",

      "title": "Progenitor Diversity and Architecture of the Human Ganglionic Eminences Shaping the Basal Ganglia",
      "content": "The embryonic medial and lateral ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE) are the principal sources of most neurons and glia for the basal ganglia. In primates, the MGE has a distinctive cytoarchitecture characterized by doublecortin enriched cellular nests (DENs), yet the architectonic organization underlying DEN formation, the molecular heterogeneity of ganglionic eminence progenitors and their lineage relationships, remain poorly understood. Here, using paired single-nucleus transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling of the three GEs, we identify distinct progenitor populations, delineate their gene regulatory networks, and reconstruct their lineage trajectories. Live imaging reveals a unipolar outer radial glia-like population (GE-oRG) that undergoes mitotic somal translocation. Spatial transcriptomics identifies a distinct CRABP1+/ANGPT2+ domain within the MGE. Integrated spatial and electron microscopy demonstrates a periphery-to-center gradient of differentiation in the MGE. Leveraging DEN-forming MGE organoids derived from PCDH19 knockout human pluripotent stem cell lines, we identify the protocadherin, PCDH19, as a key regulator of DEN formation.",

      "title": "SEZ6L2 Loss Disrupts Motor Coordination, Cognitive Function, and Synaptic Connectivity",
      "content": "The SEZ6 family, composed of SEZ6, SEZ6L, and SEZ6L2, plays essential roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic organization, and complement regulation. However, the specific contribution of SEZ6L2 to brain function remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive behavioral and neurobiological characterization of Sez6l2 knockout (KO) mice and directly compare their phenotype with Sez6 triple knockout (TKO) mice, which lack all three Sez6 family genes. Sez6l2 KO mice exhibit impairments across multiple behavioral domains, including motor coordination, gait, sociability, sensory processing, and goal-directed repetitive behaviors. Several phenotypes, particularly motor deficits, worsen with age. Male Sez6l2 KO mice also demonstrate enhanced fear learning and increased prepulse inhibition, revealing sex-specific alterations in sensorimotor gating. At the synaptic level, Sez6l2 KO mice show reduced dendritic spine length and decreased expression of key postsynaptic proteins suggesting impaired excitatory synaptic connectivity. These structural and molecular abnormalities likely contribute to the observed behavioral deficits. In comparison, Sez6 TKO mice display more severe impairments across most measures. Together, these findings establish SEZ6L2 as a critical and non-redundant regulator of motor, cognitive, and synaptic function and provide mechanistic insight into how dysfunction within the SEZ6 family may contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Sex-specific relationships between stress coping and avoidancebehavior",
      "content": "While the experience of stress is ubiquitous, the risk of developing stress-linked conditions such as anxiety and depression is related to maladaptive stress responses. In order to probe the relationship between stress coping, sex, and stress-linked behavioral outcomes, we exposed male and female mice to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) and measured the correlation between coping during the tail suspension stressors (TSS) of SCVS and avoidance behavior in the EPM. We found that females engage in more active coping, and there were no sex differences in avoidance or locomotor behavior in the EPM after stress. However, we found that greater active coping predicted greater avoidance in females, but less avoidance in males. The results demonstrate that coping strategies are dynamic across time in males and females, but the relationships between avoidance and coping strategy dynamics are sex-biased.",

      "title": "Meta-learning is expressed through altered prefrontal cortical dynamics",
      "content": "Learning where and when rewards like food and water are available is essential for survival. In the simplest cases where resource availability is stable, animals can learn reward contingencies by integrating outcomes across repeated samples of each option. In more natural settings, however, reward availability is governed by complex contingencies such as depletion and repletion over time. To flexibly adapt to such changing environments, optimal choices require meta-learning wherein animals learn how to learn from external feedback, eventually enabling them to infer reward contingencies from more abstract and generalizable rules rather than relying solely on recent outcomes. The existence of meta-learning in animal behavior is well established, yet the neural circuits and computations that implement it remain poorly understood. Here we investigated meta-learning using a spatial foraging task in which rats acquired a novel depletion-repletion rule, and carried out longitudinal, high-density recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We show that meta-learning engages specific, systematic changes in mPFC neural dynamics that embed the learned rule and thereby alter the way the network learns option values from reward outcomes. These dynamics are based on mixed coding of task structure and value in individual mPFC neurons which, at the population level, organize into low-dimensional dynamical motifs that generalize across task conditions. As meta-learning progresses, these motifs are reshaped to instantiate both rule-guided inference of future states before outcome delivery and rule-based value updating during the outcome period. These results indicate that meta-learning sculpts pre-existing prefrontal dynamics to support the acquisition of new reward-learning strategies.",

      "title": "Subspace communication in the hippocampal-retrosplenial axis",
      "content": "The capacity and flexibility of hippocampal circuits for transforming inputs into downstream outputs is fundamental for navigation and memory, yet the circuit-level mechanisms that allow this operation to adapt across experiences remain unknown. We approach this problem by performing large-scale (up to 1024-channel) recordings across the hippocampal-retrosplenial cortex (RSC) circuit in behaving mice, enabling simultaneous access to spiking activity in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, CA1, RSC. Based on a linear dimensionality reduction technique known as partial canonical correlation analysis, we identify low-dimensional communication subspaces1 between two regions while accounting for measured third-area influences. These subspaces captured distinct input-output transformations in CA1, linking upstream (DG, CA3, and CA2) hippocampal activity to downstream cortical targets (RSC). Iintrinsic firing properties and anatomical location constrained subspace memberships--members were mapped to deep sublayers of the CA3-CA1-RSC axis during both spatial and non-spatial tasks. These subspaces could recombine overlapping neuronal pools to support distinct interareal interactions across changing experiences and brain states. Reactivation patterns of CA1-CA3 subspaces, but not those of CA1-RSC, during post-experience sleep correlated with replay, reflecting a plasticity-stability balance of the input-output transformation in the hippocampal-retrosplenial axis. Our data suggest a model in which hippocampal-neocortical communication reconfigures predetermined circuit motifs to flexibly encode experiences.",

      "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

      "content": "This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) are able to perform tasks which require higher-order theory of mind (ToM)\u2014the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g., I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

      "title": "Exploring the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of medical cannabinoids in ischemic stroke: a systematic meta-analysis with bibliometric mapping of cerebral ischemia research",
      "content": "BackgroundIschemic stroke is an acute neurological disorder with limited treatment options. Medical cannabinoids (MCs), primary bioactive compounds extracted from cannabis plants, have shown therapeutic prospects for ischemic stroke. This study integrates bibliometrics and meta-analysis to comprehensively summarize the research landscape of MCs in cerebral ischemia and thoroughly investigate their role and potential mechanisms in ischemic stroke.MethodsBibliometric analysis was performed based on literature retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), PubMed, and Scopus. For meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was conducted across four databases (WoSCC, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and grey literature repositories. Studies were screened according to predefined criteria. Pooled standardized mean differences with 95% confidence interval were calculated, followed by subgroup analysis.ResultsA total of 241 publications were identified for bibliometric analysis. From 2000 to June 2025, the annual publication output on MCs in cerebral ischemia displayed a fluctuating yet overall upward trend. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed three major research topics: neuroprotective mechanisms of MCs, pathological models of cerebral ischemia, and bioactive components of MCs. Meta-analysis of 26 studies demonstrated that MCs provided significant neuroprotection in animal models of ischemic stroke, including cerebral infarct volume, neurological function score (NFS), cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water content, apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cells), oxidative stress markers, inflammation (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), and excitotoxicity (Glu/NAA, Lac/NAA ratio). Subgroup analysis revealed that intraperitoneal administration and a full-course of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment were associated with reduced heterogeneity and enhanced therapeutic benefit. Isoflurane was identified as a potentially suitable anesthetic.ConclusionMCs exert multi-target neuroprotection in ischemic stroke by improving CBF, reducing brain edema and BBB permeability, and inhibiting oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity. Future research should focus on high-quality clinical trials to validate these findings and translate MCs into clinical practice.Systematic review registrationhttps://osf.io/6je7n.",

      "title": "Transfer learning for subject-independent motor imagery EEG classification using convolutional relational networks",
      "content": "Motor imagery (MI) based electroencephalography (EEG) classification is central to brain-computer interface (BCI) research but practical deployment remains challenging due to poor generalization across subjects. Inter-individual variability in neural activity patterns significantly limits the development of subject-independent BCIs for healthcare and assistive technologies. To address this limitation, we present a transfer learning framework based on Convolutional Relational Networks (ConvoReleNet) designed to extract subject-invariant neural representations while minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The method integrates convolutional feature extraction, relational modeling, and lightweight recurrent processing, combined with pretraining on a diverse subject pool followed by conservative fine-tuning. Validation was conducted on two widely used benchmarks, BNCI IV-2a (four-class motor imagery) and BNCI IV-2b (binary motor imagery), to evaluate subject-independent classification performance. Results demonstrate clear improvements over training from scratch: accuracy on BNCI IV-2a increased from 72.22 (\u00b120.49) to 79.44% (\u00b111.09), while BNCI IV-2b improved from 75.10 (\u00b117.17) to 83.85% (\u00b110.30). The best-case performance reached 87.55% on BNCI IV-2a with Tanh activation and 83.85% on BNCI IV-2b with ELU activation, accompanied by reductions in inter-subject variance of 45.9 and 40.0%, respectively. These findings establish transfer learning as an effective strategy for subject-independent MI-EEG classification. By enhancing accuracy, reducing variability, and maintaining computational efficiency, the proposed framework strengthens the feasibility of robust and user-friendly BCIs for rehabilitation, clinical use, and assistive applications.",

      "content": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays an essential role in brain function and development. Variants in the APP gene are associated with both familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We report a case of early onset, slowly progressive mixed dementia with a newly identified APP variant. The patient developed mild cognitive impairment at age 51, followed by neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizures, and progressive white matter changes. Despite a fluctuating clinical course, significant deterioration occurred later, culminating in death at age 77. Genetic testing revealed an APP c.2086G\u202f>\u202fA (p.Gly696Ser) variant, currently classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Postmortem examination showed definite AD neuropathologic changes, with fully blown amyloid pathology including amyloid deposits in plaques as well as in severe generalized cerebral angiopathy with concomitant advanced FTLD-tau pathology. In silico analysis of the variant\u2019s impact was performed, and the inconclusive results are discussed later.",
