      "content": "The development of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology in Alzheimer s disease (AD) is accompanied by profound changes in astrocytes and microglia. How these responses are orchestrated by cell surface proteins, key mediators of cell-cell communication, remain unclear. Using in situ astrocyte cell-surface proteome profiling in 5xFAD mice, we identified a set of dysregulated surface proteins induced by A{beta} pathology, including CD44. CD44 was selectively upregulated in plaque-adjacent astrocytes and interacted with osteopontin (OPN), encoded by the diseaseassociated microglia gene Spp1, to promote lipid accumulation, and this effect is {gamma}-secretase dependent. Astrocytic CD44 in turn regulated Spp1 expression and microglial activity. Conditional deletion of Cd44 in adult astrocytes of 5xFAD mice attenuated glial reactivity, reduced A{beta} pathology, and improved cognition. These findings define a plaque-proximal OPN-CD44 axis that controls astrocyte lipid metabolism and glial activity, positioning CD44 as a surface-accessible therapeutic target in AD.",

      "title": "Early intervention with a PACAP lactoside following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury prevents persistent LHb hyperactivity and motivational deficits in male mice",
      "content": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often leads to long-lasting mood disorders and motivational deficits, significantly decreasing quality of life. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has known neuroprotective effects and is often deficient in neurological conditions, but its role in preventing mTBI's long-term effects on mood circuits remains unclear. Our previous studies of repetitive closed-head mTBI in murine models found that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a key area for post-injury impairments. These impairments are characterized by mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and mood-related behavioral deficits. Here we investigated if a novel PACAP type I receptor (PAC1R) agonist, TES2320, could prevent or treat these long-term mTBI effects. The drug is based on a truncated glycoside analogue of PACAP that is stable and brain penetrant. Using RNAscope, we first found that mTBI caused a persistent and widespread reduction in PACAP mRNA within the LHb, suggesting a possible mTBI-related PACAP signaling deficiency in LHb circuits. We then used two intervention strategies in young adult male mice: an early intervention administered immediately after injury and a late intervention given as a single injection one-month post-injury. One month after injury, we measured LHb activity and self-care grooming motivation. Both early and late PAC1 agonist interventions almost completely normalized the mTBI-induced increases in LHb spontaneous tonic activity and hyperexcitability. However, only the early intervention improved the delayed initiation of grooming seen in mTBI mice. Unfortunately, a single late PAC1R agonist injection not only failed to reverse the grooming delay, but also significantly reduced total grooming behavior 24 hours after treatment. This finding points to a potential behavioral side effect of late PAC1R agonist administration on grooming. Overall, our findings confirm that an early PAC1R agonist intervention effectively prevents mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and associated motivational deficits, likely by restoring the persistent PACAP signaling deficiency in the LHb and its related circuits. This preclinical study provides strong evidence that novel PAC1R agonists could be a valuable preventive therapy for mTBI-related depression and anti-reward circuit dysfunction.",

      "title": "Tether-mediated extraction of myelinoid bodies by microglia and astrocytes can maintain myelin integrity",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes make myelin for the electrical insulation of axons and saltatory impulse conduction. Myelin lipids and proteins undergo a slow turnover, but exactly how the multilamellar and compacted membrane sheaths are remodeled without compromising myelin sheath integrity has remained puzzling, in particular at advanced age when myelin abnormalities increase. Earlier EM studies had suggested myelin membranes are shed and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia. However, the formation of multilamellar myelinoid bodies (MBs), leaving a well-ordered myelin sheath behind, is difficult to reconcile with simple shedding mechanisms. Here, we show by three-dimensional FIB-SEM reconstructions of optic nerves in mice and by two-photon live-imaging of myelinated cortical slices that MBs are initially connected to their parental sheaths by long tethers, which are stretched by trogocytosing microglia and astrocytes. We observe ruptured tethers attached to both MBs and sheaths, suggesting a novel mechanism of tension-driven tether scission. Importantly, the successive fusion of the corresponding innermost myelin membranes in an extended tether can preserve myelin sheath integrity. Thus, the remodeling by tether-mediated MB extraction emerges as a mechanism of physiological maintenance of myelin sheaths in the CNS.",

      "title": "Loss of neurexins disrupts inhibitory connectivity and increases vulnerability of dopamine neurons in culture",
      "content": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are essential regulators of basal ganglia function. Their axonal structure is intricate, with numerous non-synaptic release sites and fewer synaptic terminals that notably release glutamate or GABA. Despite their significance, the molecular mechanisms governing DA neuron connectivity and neurochemical identity remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins (Nrxns) regulate the interactions of DA neuron axons with target cells and thereby influence axonal branching and synapse formation by DA neurons. We therefore examined neuronal survival, axonal growth and synapse formation in cultured DA neurons lacking all neurexins (DAT::NrxnsKO). Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons revealed that loss of Nrxns does not disrupt the basic development of these neurons or the structure of their axonal terminals, including normal expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, loss of Nrxns affects the survival of DA neurons and their formation of inhibitory synapses, suggesting that Nrxns regulate the axonal connectivity of these neurons.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

So, subprocesses was out of question.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/FauvidoTechnologies/binwalk-python-sdk\">library</a> after I achieved some preliminary functionality (which is today) and decided to post it in case someone else also was searching for something like this.</p> <p>There is a long way to go, I am going to try and replicate every functionality of binwalk which I can, so far I have a basic `scan` and `extract`. Its pip installable and I hope its useful for you all as well!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone who's interested in performing binwalk functions through a simple python interface.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The existing projects are either not a python library or they're broken or they are running binwalk as a subprocess. I couldn't afford any of those so I made sure that this one doesn't do that.</p> <p>Right now it doesn't have much functionality except scan and extract as I mentioned before, but I am also actively developing this so there will be more in the future</p> <p>Thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Sky6805\"> /u/Ok-Sky6805 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phqpqy/built_a_python_library_for_using_binwalk/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phqpqy/built_a_python_library_for_using_binwalk/\">[comments]</a></span>",
