      "title": "Ensemble Coding of Hidden Objects in Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Many species exhibit the understanding that visual objects that become hidden by others nonetheless still exist, a property known as object permanence. Previous studies in human and nonhuman primates have provided evidence that neurons within visual cortex encode objects that are remembered but not seen. However, past neurophysiological studies have generally failed to find evidence of visual cortical representations of hidden objects. We measured the activity of large populations of neurons within dorsal extrastriate cortex of macaques trained to monitor the identity of visual objects that moved behind an irrelevant occluder. We found that although the firing rates of neuronal populations signaled the trajectory of hidden objects throughout the occlusion period, coding of object identity in the same activity decayed to chance before the behavioral trial ended. Nevertheless, information about the hidden object was present in the coordinated activity of neuronal populations. Specifically, the strength and presence of pairwise cross-correlations reliably depended on the identity of the hidden object. These results demonstrate that ensembles of visual cortical neurons preserve information about hidden objects independent of single neuron firing rates.",

      "title": "Transferable CNN-based data mining approaches for medical imaging: application to spine DXA scans for osteoporosis detection",
      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

      "title": "From movement to cognitive maps: recurrent neural networks reveal how locomotor development shapes hippocampal spatial coding",
      "content": "The hippocampus contains neurons whose firing correlates with an animal's location and orientation in space. Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.",

      "title": "Type 2 diabetes Reprograms Bone Marrow Hematopoiesis and Dysregulates Immune Signaling in Response to Stroke",
      "content": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.",

      "content": "Understanding how neural circuits compute requires capturing voltage dynamics across large neuronal populations with millisecond resolution in vivo. However, two-photon voltage imaging remains fundamentally limited by a trade-off among imaging speed, field of view, and excitation efficiency. We introduce HS2PM, a hybrid scanning two-photon microscope that overcomes this bottleneck, enabling kilohertz-rate imaging over a 650x524 m2 field of view at single-cell resolution while preserving the photon efficiency of single-point excitation. HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. It resolves both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in vivo, revealing how these jointly shape sensory adaptation and population coding. Beyond voltage imaging, HS2PM supports high-speed fluorescence lifetime and vascular flow imaging, establishing a multimodal platform for dissecting fast circuit dynamics with precision previously inaccessible to optical methods.",
