      "title": "Pain-regulation circuitry as a predictor of chronic pain phenotypes",
      "content": "Background: Chronic pain is a multidimensional condition in which emotional distress, negative expectations, and functional impairment signal greater disease severity. Standard diagnostic categories often fail to capture clinically meaningful heterogeneity, highlighting the need for mechanistic phenotyping. Methods: We studied 159 individuals with fibromyalgia or chronic low back pain and 72 healthy controls. Participants completed a cue-based expectation task with calibrated thermal stimuli. Principal component and cluster analyses were used to derive high and low pain, disability, and affective distress (PDA) phenotypes. Groups were compared on expectation-induced pain modulation (EIPM) and resting state connectivity of periaqueductal gray (PAG) subregions. Stepwise machine learning models evaluated whether clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging features could classify PDA phenotypes. Results: High PDA patients exhibited impaired pain modulation when positive expectations were violated, particularly under low-threat cues (P<0.05), and reported higher catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and medication use than low PDA patients. Resting-state analyses revealed more negative dorsolateral/lateral PAG to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex coupling in the high PDA group. Machine learning models classified PDA subtypes above chance, with maximal accuracy when PAG connectivity was combined with clinical and behavioral measures. Conclusions: Severe chronic pain characterized by high emotional distress, disability, and pain is associated with disrupted expectation driven modulation and altered PAG connectivity. Integrating symptom profiles with neural and behavioral markers provides a biologically informed framework for identifying phenotypes with distinct treatment needs. These results suggest that expectation-related pain regulation and midbrain circuitry represent complementary mechanistic targets for precision interventions in chronic pain.",

      "title": "Cortico-Hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling is a signature of learned audiovisual associations in humans",
      "content": "Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) has been proposed as an elegant neural mechanism for representing sequential items in memory, coordinating distant brain regions, and parsing complex sensory inputs. Yet, whether PAC carries content-specific, behaviorally meaningful information has not been demonstrated to date. Here, using human intracranial recordings before, during and after an audio-visual associative learning task, we show that PAC is an information-coding mechanism. PAC strength in cortico-hippocampal networks increased linearly during learning and remained significantly stronger post vs. pre-learning. More importantly, PAC comodulograms carried stimulus- and association-specific information: auditory items were decodable in auditory cortex before learning based on PAC features, while learned associations were classified across hippocampo-temporo-frontal networks during and after learning. Post-learning brain decoding confusion matrices closely mirrored behavioral confusion matrices, and PAC patterns were independent of low-level stimulus features. These findings suggest that PAC is an endogenously generated marker that supports perception and associative learning in the human brain.",

      "title": "Shared and distinct default mode systems in mental time travel and affective experience over time",
      "content": "Overarching conceptualizations propose a critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in self-referential mental time travel, particularly in autobiographical memory retrieval and episodic future thinking, and internal (intrinsic) emotion generation and regulation. However, these conceptualizations have not been directly evaluated. Against this background, the present fMRI study aimed to identify both shared and distinct neural systems underlying autobiographical episodic processing across different temporal contexts - specifically, episodic memory retrieval (EMR) and episodic future thinking (EFT) - and to examine how these systems interact with affective experiences, including valence and arousal. Our findings demonstrated the central role of the DMN - encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) - in both EMR and EFT. Importantly, we identified a functional dissociation along both valence and temporal dimensions: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was more strongly associated with positive experiences and simulations, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was consistently engaged during the processing of negative affect across past and future contexts. Moreover, representational similarity and parametric analyses indicated that the hippocampus supports differential processing of valence and arousal across temporal domains. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence for the involvement of cortical midline core DMN systems in autobiographical processing across time and suggest overlapping and distinct systems for the integration of emotional experiences across mental time travel.",

      "title": "A reproducible human brain tissue model to study physiological and disease-associated microglia phenotypes",
      "content": "Stem-cell-based in vitro models offer promising potential to elucidate human brain cell functions and interactions under physiological and pathological conditions. However, harnessing this potential is impaired by low reproducibility, maturity, or cell-type diversity of existing models. Especially, prolonged incorporation of mature microglia and studies of neuroinflammation have proven challenging. Here, we developed a 3D cortical brain tissue model (3BTM) containing neurons, astrocytes, and microglia with high reproducibility, maturity, and viability. 3BTMs show morphological, functional, and proteomic maturation of all cell types, leading to high similarity to their in vivo counterparts. Incorporated microglia survive for over 6 months and display mature morphology, functions, and gene expression. Importantly, when engineered to model Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, 3BTMs recapitulate key disease hallmarks including amyloid deposition, increased phospho-Tau levels, and neuroinflammation, with microglia shifting their transcriptional landscape to disease-relevant signatures. Treatment of AD 3BTMs with anti-A{beta} immunotherapy cleared deposits and largely reversed disease signatures in glia. Together, our model offers unprecedented possibilities for studying physiological and pathological states of human brain tissue and translational applications.",

      "title": "Medial Olivocochlear Activity Modulates Central Auditory Synapse Structure and Function",
      "content": "In many mammals, the auditory system is immature at birth and undergoes activity-dependent refinement. The medial olivocochlear system (MOC) contributes to the maturation of central auditory connectivity by shaping spontaneous activity in the developing inner ear. Although altered MOC activity has been linked to electrical and synaptic dysfunctions in different central auditory nuclei, an in-depth analysis of the same synapse under conditions of absent versus enhanced MOC activity is lacking. In this work, we set out a physiological and structural analysis of the calyx of Held and the principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (CH-MNTB) synapse at postnatal days 12-14 in three mouse models of either sex: wild-type (WT), 9 knock-in (9KI; with enhanced MOC activity), and 9 knock-out (9KO; which lacks MOC activity). Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices revealed a reduced synaptic strength efficacy in 9KI compared to WT, including smaller excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes, stronger short-term depression during repetitive stimulation and a decrease readily releasable pool size. In contrast, 9KO mice showed minimal synaptic differences relative to WT. Serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) reconstructions demonstrated morphological alterations of the CH in both MOC-manipulated mouse models. However, 9KI mice exhibited the largest deviations, including fewer morphologically complex CHs and increased poly-innervation of MNTB cells. These results indicate that transient, well-regulated efferent control of cochlear activity is crucial for establishing accurate central auditory connectivity. Moreover, the enhancement of MOC activity drives more pronounced developmental changes in brainstem auditory circuitry than its absence.",

      "title": "Replication Challenges in Linking Personality to Resting-State Functional Connectomics",
      "content": "An increasing number of studies are currently focusing on \"personality neuroscience\", a term labeling the research aimed at neuroimaging correlates of inter-individual temperament and character variability. Among other methods, a graph theoretical analysis of the functional connectivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was applied in a study by Gao et al (2013), reporting novel functional connectivity correlates of personality traits. The current paper presents an independent validation of the results of this study and discusses the related challenges, including extension of the original statistical methods in order to illustrate the effect of the multiple comparison problem. Five personality dimensions were obtained using the revised \"Big Five\" Personality Inventory, including scores of Extraversion and Neuroticism covered in the original paper. Using a larger sample (84 subjects) with power over eighty percent, we failed to replicate any of the nine specific neuroimaging correlates of personality presented by Gao et al. While acknowledging differences in the experimental procedures, we discuss that the lack of replication might be caused by the relatively liberal control of false positives in the original study. Indeed, the original testing scheme leads to an expected count of about 10 false positive observations among all tests; applying this scheme to our data we observed a similar number of positive tests, albeit for different relations. No significant correlations were found in our data when standard family-wise error control was applied. These results illustrate the importance of combining exploration with independent validation, use of large datasets, as well as appropriate control of multiple comparison problem in order to prevent false alarms in research into neurological substrates of personality differences. Of course, our findings to disprove the existence of link between personality and brain's intrinsic functional architecture; but rather suggest such link might be even more subtle and elusive than previously reported.",

      "title": "Modular Integration of Auditory Instructions and Visual Cues into the Cortical Reach Network",
      "content": "Humans depend on the brain's ability to integrate multisensory cues for 'top-down' motor strategies with 'bottom-up' stimulus attributes. For example, one can be verbally instructed to use different grasp strategies to acquire an object with the same visual attributes. Conversely, failure to integrate such cues, i.e., following brain damage, could greatly impair goal-directed behavior. To understand how such cues are mapped onto action plans, we employed an event-related fMRI paradigm in which visual and auditory cues were presented successively in randomized order. Twelve participants viewed a physical cube presented to their left or right (bottom-up sensory input) and were verbally instructed to perform a horizontal or vertical grip (top-down motor strategy). To map brain activity through the task, we employed univariate activation analysis, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, graph-theory analysis (GTA) based connectivity analyses, and used GTA features to decode cue-order information. Univariate voxel-wise and ROI analysis confirmed order-dependent activation of visual and auditory cortex, followed by mounting parietofrontal activation as cues accumulated for action. GTA analysis revealed two significant subnetworks (modules): one spanning Occipital-Parietal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating visual object attributes into the reach plan) and the other spanning Temporal-Frontal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating instructions into the grasp plan). Cue order influenced modularity, i.e., the module corresponding to the first cue module tended to dominate contralateral motor cortex. A classification model decoded cue order, based primarily on modularity. Local (within module) network hubs occupied traditional cortical action areas and were order-independent, whereas global (between modules) network hubs were more scattered and order-dependent. These results show that sensorimotor integration is modular, depending on cue modality, functional relevance of the cue, and presentation order. The occipital-parietal / temporal-frontal modularity observed here suggests that the brain can flexibly map sensory inputs through different cortical pathways to achieve effective multisensory-motor integration.",

      "title": "Infant cortical tracking of speech shows emerging spatial release from masking in the first year of life",
      "content": "Natural listening environments are filled with competing sounds. One mechanism that helps overcome this challenge is spatial release from masking (SRM), whereby spatial separation between a target signal and interfering sounds improves perception of the target. SRM has been observed in a wide range of species including songbirds, crocodilians, ferrets, and human adults, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved strategy for listening in noise. However, an important question remains: Is an infant's developing brain able to tap into the same mechanism to cope with the noisy world? To address this question, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 7- and 11-month-old infants (N = 53) and adults (N = 20) as they listened to natural speech in quiet, collocated noise, and spatially segregated noise. Our results revealed that both infants and adults showed robust cortical tracking of speech across quiet and noisy listening conditions. For adults, spatial separation between the target speaker and distracting talkers led to enhanced cortical tracking of the target speech, consistent with SRM. Infants also showed SRM, with stronger tracking in segregated than collocated noise, although the effect was confined to a frontal-central region rather than broadly distributed across the scalp as in adults. These findings provide the first neurophysiological evidence that, although still immature, the developing brain can benefit from spatial cues in the first year of life. Together, these results add new insight into how the infant brain solves a fundamental perceptual problem - identifying a relevant voice in a noisy environment - using a mechanism that is evolutionarily grounded.",

      "title": "Cortico-basal ganglia dynamics of global and selective response inhibition in humans",
      "content": "Response inhibition is an important cognitive control mechanism, which enables flexible behavior by stopping inappropriate actions. Intracranial recordings across species have identified a neural circuit that implements response inhibition via the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia. However, this work has been limited to simple tasks, in which unequivocal, salient \"stop\"-signals require the inhibition of all ongoing responses. Notably, response inhibition in the real world is substantially different. Real-world response inhibition is selective: it occurs only after specific salient signals ( stimulus-selectivity) and stops only specific movements, while others continue ( response-selectivity). If and how the fronto-subthalamic system implements selective inhibition is largely unknown. Here, we recorded subthalamic local field potentials and scalp-EEG in humans performing a novel, selective inhibition task. Salient signals either required stopping all initiated responses (global inhibition), stopping only some responses (response-selective inhibition), or continuing all responses - i.e., ignoring the signal (which ensures stimulus-selectivity). All three signals initially triggered a common fronto-subthalamic inhibitory process, signified by a rapid increase in {beta}-burst activity. During global inhibition, subthalamic {beta}-bursting subsequently increased above baseline, persisting for over a second. During response-selective inhibition, this activity was delayed, which enabled a second bout of disinhibition and allowed appropriate responses to continue. Throughout this period, frontal cortical and subthalamic {beta}-band activity was tightly coupled. This shows that selective inhibition is implemented through rapid, context-dependent engagement and release of fronto-subthalamic inhibition. Moreover, subthalamic activity lasted substantially longer than assumed by classic behavioral-computational models. This supports recent theoretical models that assume protracted response inhibition during action-stopping.",

      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",
