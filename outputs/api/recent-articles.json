      "title": "Autocrine feedback maintains homeostatic neuropeptide expression in a peptidergichub neuron",
      "content": "Neuronal circuits sustain stable function by self-regulating their gene expression and neurosecretion. Patterns for autocrine feedback by neuropeptides are widespread across nervous systems, but how they contribute to neuronal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an autocrine homeostatic mechanism in a C. elegans peptidergic hub neuron. FLP-1 neuropeptide release activates the inhibitory receptor DMSR-7 on the AVK hub neurons to self-regulate flp-1 transcription, dense-core vesicle accumulation, and peptide secretion. We show that a parallel PDF-1/PDFR-1 pathway drives flp-1 expression, establishing a \"push-and-pull\" peptidergic feedback on the AVK neurons. AVK's peptidergic output also depends on the number of FLP-1 peptides encoded in its precursor, revealing a dosage mechanism in behavioral regulation. Moreover, flp-1 expression coordinates transcript levels of additional neuropeptides in AVK. These findings uncover FLP-1 as a self-regulating homeostatic controller within a peptidergic hub neuron and illustrate how precursor-encoded redundancy supports stable yet adaptable circuit states.",

      "title": "3D Light Sheet Microscopy Reveals Aging Osteoarthritis-associated Joint-innervated Nerve Remodeling in Mouse Knee Joints",
      "content": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age related joint disease-causing chronic pain. This study investigated how nociceptive and sympathetic nerve innervation in the mouse knee joint changes with age and OA progression, and how these changes relate to pain and disease severity. Methods: Thirty-eight mice were assigned to four groups: young male (My), aged male (Ma), young female (Fy), and aged female (Fa). Pain sensitivity was evaluated via Pressure Application Measurement (PAM), and joint damage was graded using OARSI scoring. CGRP and PIEZO2 expressions in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also assessed. We employed iDISCO tissue clearing and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize total (PGP9.5), nociceptive (CGRP), and sympathetic (TH) nerve fibers in anterior regions of mouse knee joints. A MATLAB-based tool quantified nerve architecture. Results: The Ma group displayed the highest OA severity and markedly lower mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with My, suggesting an age effect on pain-related behavior. This phenotype was accompanied by a higher total PGP9.5; nerve fiber density in the knee joint and increased CGRP nociceptive innervation. In contrast, female mice showed no age-dependent change in PAM withdrawal thresholds, consistent with preserved cartilage integrity and stable OARSI scores, and no detectable age-related differences in PGP9.5; or CGRP; innervation. The TH; sympathetic fiber distribution was comparable across sexes and ages. Consistent with joint-level findings, DRG analyses demonstrated increased CGRP and PIEZO2 expression in the Ma group, whereas females exhibited no significant change. Conclusion: Enhanced nociceptive but not sympathetic nerve remodeling in knee cavities is associated with increased OA severity and knee pain in the Ma group. These findings emphasize the role of peripheral sensory plasticity in OA pain and demonstrate the value of 3D imaging for visualizing neuroanatomical changes in joint disorders.",

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "The Oneiric Circle and the Misioneros del Temporal in Morelos, Mexico.",
      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "title": "Low-grade inflammation in obesity causes low-effort food choice",
      "content": "Inflammation relates to decreased effortful behaviour and altered effort-related responses in brain regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Inflammation is prevalent in obesity, but its effects on effortful versus more convenient food choices are unknown. We investigated the role of low-grade inflammation in effortful food choice using functional MRI in a cross-sectional study (n=150 women, BMI>27 kg/m2) and a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n=59 women, BMI>30 kg/m2, CRP>3 mg/L; colchicine 0.5 mg/d vs. placebo). Inflammation was related to less high-effort choices (OR=0.27, p=0.004) and higher effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=0.23, p=0.025, Rpartial2=0.039), and mediated the association between BMI and dmPFC signal. Colchicine decreased systemic inflammation (i.e. INFLA-score) as expected ({beta}=-0.10 SD, p<0.001, Rpartial2=0.030), increased high-effort choices (OR=1.32, p=0.044), and marginally decreased effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=-0.13, p=0.053, Rpartial2=0.037). These findings show a causal role for inflammation in choosing convenience foods in obesity via increased effort aversion and associated dmPFC processing.",

      "title": "When Velocity Becomes Position: Proprioceptive Contributions to State Estimation",
      "content": "In this study, we investigate the relative contributions of positional- and velocity-based proprioceptive feedback to state estimation when visual feedback of the hand is unavailable. We performed a virtual reality experiment in which healthy human participants (N = 22) completed two tasks: a continuous target-tracking task and a sequential reaching task. In both cases, visual feedback of the hand position was withheld, except for a brief moment, during which an offset to the left or right was sometimes applied. By analysing the movement path following the offset visual feedback and comparing it to the non-offset condition, we can infer the extent to which the brain relies on rate-of-change feedback compared to absolute positional feedback for estimating the hand position. We compare and contrast our empirical data with simulated movements from a computational model based on Bayesian sensory integration under varied assumptions of the reliance on positional and velocity-based cues. Our human and simulated data together indicate a heavy reliance on velocity-based proprioceptive feedback, as movement offsets induced by biased visual feedback decay slowly during both target tracking and sequential reaching tasks. The eventual convergence between offset and non-offset trials demonstrates that absolute positional information is incorporated, albeit at a slow rate.",
