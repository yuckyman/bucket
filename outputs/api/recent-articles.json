      "content": "Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for effective intervention. While previous studies have explored speech-based biomarkers for AD, this paper presents the first systematic investigation of acoustic, prosodic, and phonological speech features for detecting this neurocognitive disorder. Our study has two main objectives: (1) to assess the individual impact of AD on a wide range of speech features, and (2) to identify the most informative feature subsets using a combination of four feature ranking methods and seven machine learning classifiers. We conducted our experiments using the publicly available ADReSS Challenge dataset, allowing for direct comparison with prior speech-based approaches. Our analysis focused on continuous acoustic and prosodic measures as well as discrete phonological features, both independently and in combination. The best performance, with an F1-score of 0.89, was achieved using the optimal subset of acoustic features with ensemble learning and by integrating all three feature types, suggesting that combining continuous and categorical speech features offers complementary diagnostic value. This approach surpasses all previous speech-only methods in the ADReSS Challenge and comes close to the best reported overall result from the campaign's dataset, even without using lexical information. The results were further validated through positive outcomes on the Delaware corpus (focused on MCI) and a set of speeches from President Ronald Reagan (who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's). These findings suggest that speech patterns, beyond just the content, are more indicative of Alzheimer's disease than previously thought, underscoring the potential of multi-layered speech analysis for non-invasive AD detection. Keywords: Alzheimer's Disease, acoustics, speech biomarkers, phonology, prosody, non-invasive automatic screening of AD, text & speech mining, neurodegenerative disease",

Well, I figured, I am the manufacturer, so I wrote an authorization letter for myself, and even got it notarized for good measure, that I am legally allowed to sell these devices. But to no avail.<p>I have an option to \"Submit new information.\" But have no new information to submit, and fear if I try submitting anything else, I'll be permanently banned or something.<p>The funny part is that on most of the products I have listed, I am losing money, just because of the FBA costs and the advertising costs.

      "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation combined with exercise therapy for chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundChronic low-back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability, with current treatments offering only modest benefits. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance exercise therapy by modulating cortical excitability and pain-inhibitory pathways. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the additive effect of combining tDCS with structured exercise in adults with CLBP.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Embase, and CNKI up to 25 September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active tDCS plus identical exercise therapy vs. sham tDCS plus the same exercise in adults with CLBP (\u2265 12 weeks) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated for pain and function, respectively.GRADE was used to assess certainty.ResultsFive RCTs (n = 195) were included. For pain intensity (4 studies, n = 173), tDCS showed a significant additive effect (WMD = \u22120.99, 95% CI: \u22121.68 to \u22120.31, p = 0.006, I2 = 60.1%). For physical function (five studies, n = 195), the effect was favorable but non-significant (SMD = \u22120.65, 95% CI: \u22121.87 to 0.57, p = 0.28, I2 = 90.7%). Meta-regression indicated intervention duration significantly moderated functional outcomes (\u03b2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). GRADE certainty was moderate for pain and low for function.ConclusionAnodal tDCS combined with exercise provides a modest but significant additional reduction in pain intensity for CLBP. Longer intervention duration may enhance functional outcomes. Clinical significance should be interpreted cautiously. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation parameters.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251151315, identifier CRD420251151315.",
