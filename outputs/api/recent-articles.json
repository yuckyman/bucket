Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: The ophthalmic comorbidities, such as blepharitis, MGD, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, corneal abnormalities, and presenile cataract, can occur in patients with psoriasis. These are largely asymptomatic and subtle findings that are often missed. They require an early consult to ophthalmology for appropriate management. The major limitations in this study are that it is a single-center, cross-sectional study design that has a low number of patients, lacks a healthy...",
