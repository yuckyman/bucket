      "title": "Cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of serotonin 5-HT7 receptors in a mouse model of schizophrenia",
      "content": "Serotonin 5-HT7 receptors (5-HT7Rs) have emerged as promising targets for treating cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their cellular substrates and circuit-level mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we combined immunohistochemistry, multisite electrophysiology, and behavioral assays to investigate how 5-HT7Rs modulate hippocampal-prefrontal pathways in healthy mice and in a subchronic phencyclidine (sPCP) model of cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We found that 5-HT7Rs are abundantly expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with high co-expression in PV+ and SST+ interneurons (~80% in dHPC; 55% PV+ and 75% SST+ in mPFC). In healthy mice, systemic 5-HT7R activation with the agonist AS-19 suppressed neuronal activity and synchrony within dHPC (CA1) - mPFC (PL) pathways, reducing theta and high-gamma power, theta-gamma coupling in CA1, theta coherence, and CA1-to-PL directional connectivity, consistent with recruitment of inhibitory microcircuits. The similarity between 5-HT7R-mediated inhibition and the circuit effects we previously described for 5-HT1AR activation, together with evidence for 5-HT7R-5-HT1AR heterodimerization, suggests that these receptors act in concert to dynamically constrain hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. sPCP treatment induced persistent recognition-memory impairments, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and pathological high-frequency synchronization of hippocampal-prefrontal networks. Blockade of 5-HT7Rs with SB-269970 or the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone (but not lurasidone combined with AS-19) rescued memory performance, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and normalized aberrant high-frequency hypersynchrony, while enhancing CA1-to-PL theta signaling immediately before memory acquisition. Together, these findings indicate that 5-HT7R activation exerts potent inhibitory control over hippocampal-prefrontal pathways, likely via PV and SST interneurons, and suggest that 5-HT7R blockade constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy to restore excitation-inhibition balance and enhance neural communication within brain circuits crucial for cognition and mood regulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "EEG-based analyses reveal different temporal processing patterns in aesthetic evaluation",
      "content": "Background: Existing studies estimate harmony values using the color harmony model, but how these values are reflected in distinct neural stages (early automatic vs. late evaluative) and shape subjective preferences remains unexamined. Methods: To fill this gap, we recorded behavioral and event-related potential data (N=30 adults, age: 29.20{+/-}2.38 years old) to examine whether the predictions of color harmony theory regarding harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations align with neural activity from a color perception paradigm. Results: Behavioral results showed that two-color combinations received higher aesthetic pleasantness ratings than three-color combinations, while the ratings for color harmony were relatively smaller than for disharmony. Univariate ERP analysis revealed that P1 amplitude for harmonious color was significantly higher than for disharmonious color, particularly when three colors were present. In contrast, the amplitude and latency of P2 were significantly impacted by the number of colors. Additionally, multivariate pattern analysis further demonstrated that neural activity reliably differentiated between harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations and two-color vs. three-color combinations during both P1 and P2 time window. Conclusions: These findings indicate that harmonious versus disharmonious color combinations subtly influenced early visual processing, while the number of colors used in the design had a stronger influence on aesthetic judgments.",

      "title": "Alignment of Artificial Neural Networks with Human Eye Movement Patterns in Facial Expression Recognition",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become powerful tools for modeling human perception and behavior, yet it remains unclear if they resemble the sequential eye movement strategies humans employ during visual processing. Human studies demonstrate that the first two fixations play distinct roles in face processing: the initial fixation (Fix I) captures global configurational information, while the second (Fix II) targets local diagnostic details, with the two working collaboratively to support recognition. In this study, we tested if such properties emerge in ANNs trained for facial expression recognition. We fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (VGG16) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) on multiple facial expression datasets and evaluated their performance on the same images used in a human eye-tracking experiment. Human participants (N = 28) achieved a mean accuracy of 84.2%, VGG reached 82.9%, and ViT outperformed both at 90.0%. Perturbation analyses showed that both models aligned with the independent functions of Fix I and Fix II, but only ViT displayed a synergistic effect when information from both fixations was combined. Layer-wise analyses revealed stronger correspondence with Fix II than Fix I in both models, while ViT uniquely captured the statistical dependencies of fixation transitions. These findings suggest that VGG primarily reflects feedforward, detail-based processing, whereas ViT supports feedback-like integration across sequential fixations. Our results indicate that current ANNs can approximate human eye movement patterns in face processing, and highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures to model sequential strategies in human visual exploration.",
