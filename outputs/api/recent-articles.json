If you\u2019ve never played SET there are more details/examples at \u201chow to play\u201d in the game.<p>The mechanics of Tidy Baby are sort of inspired by a solitaire/practice version of SET I sometimes play where you draw two random cards and have to name the third card that would make a valid set.<p>In Tidy Baby you are presented with two \u201cgame cards\u201d and a grid of up to nine candidates to complete a valid set \u2013 your job is to pick the right one before the clock runs out.<p>Unlike in SET, you get points for \u201cpartial\u201d sets where your set is valid on one or two dimensions (but not all three). It\u2019s actually a pretty fun challenge to try to get only sets that are invalid along all three dimensions.<p>In building the game, we were sort of surprised that the biggest challenge was ensuring that all words were unambiguously one part of speech. You\u2019d be surprised how hard it is to find three-letter adjectives that are not also common verbs or nouns. We did our best!<p>We\u2019ve got three \u201cpaces\u201d in the game: Steady, Strenuous, and Grueling (s/o MECC!)<p>Let us know what you think!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "title": "Ensemble Coding of Hidden Objects in Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Many species exhibit the understanding that visual objects that become hidden by others nonetheless still exist, a property known as object permanence. Previous studies in human and nonhuman primates have provided evidence that neurons within visual cortex encode objects that are remembered but not seen. However, past neurophysiological studies have generally failed to find evidence of visual cortical representations of hidden objects. We measured the activity of large populations of neurons within dorsal extrastriate cortex of macaques trained to monitor the identity of visual objects that moved behind an irrelevant occluder. We found that although the firing rates of neuronal populations signaled the trajectory of hidden objects throughout the occlusion period, coding of object identity in the same activity decayed to chance before the behavioral trial ended. Nevertheless, information about the hidden object was present in the coordinated activity of neuronal populations. Specifically, the strength and presence of pairwise cross-correlations reliably depended on the identity of the hidden object. These results demonstrate that ensembles of visual cortical neurons preserve information about hidden objects independent of single neuron firing rates.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",
