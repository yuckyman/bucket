      "title": "N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation is a novel epitranscriptomic regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and vulnerability to relapse",
      "content": "While internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, the contribution of epitranscriptomics to alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains unexplored. Here we investigated, for the first time, the role of the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of alcohol drinking and alcohol mediated gene expression. The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) plays a key role in erasing m6A RNA methylation marks. We generated brain m6A hypermethylated mice with selective deletion of FTO in neurons by crossing FTO-floxed mice (FTO-fl/fl) with the synapsin-1-CRE deleter line (Syn1-CRE). Neuronal FTO-deficient mice showed enhanced initial motivation for alcohol, achieved escalated (dependent) drinking more rapidly after repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and were more susceptible to relapse to heavy drinking following a period of abstinence. Alcohol-naive neuronal FTO-deficient mice exhibited potentiated alcohol-induced anxiolytic and sedative effects and blunted anxiogenic responses, despite unaltered alcohol metabolism. We carried out RNA-Seq of enriched methylated RNA by immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA-Seq profiling of unenriched RNA to study alcohols effect on the epitranscriptomic and transcriptional landscape. We observed that a history of alcohol intoxication induces robust RNA m6A hypermethylation in the hippocampus and that FTO-deficiency markedly alters m6A methylation and transcriptional dynamics. GSEA pathway analysis showed that neuronal FTO deficiency induces addiction-relevant pathways and alters monoaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, providing a molecular basis for the heightened vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal m6A RNA methylation is a novel regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-dependent gene expression and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis AUD.",

      "title": "Rapid neocortical network modifications via dendritic plateau potential induced plasticity",
      "content": "Learning in brains is associated with changes in neuronal network activity thought to be driven by synaptic plasticity. While recent work in the hippocampus has revealed some of the mechanisms involved there, less is known about how neocortical circuits adapt, especially during behavior. Here to determine if neocortical areas possess rapid plasticity mechanisms that could support online adaptations we used optical imaging and intracellular membrane potential (Vm) recordings to examine the activity of layer V neurons in a higher visual area of mice learning a task. The introduction of a novel rewarded stimulus resulted in a rapid modification of population activity that featured abrupt alterations in single neuron selectivity. Vm recordings revealed that both naturally occurring and experimentally-induced dendritic calcium plateau potentials (plateaus) rapidly alter the action potential (APs) output and Vm dynamics of neurons over many seconds of time around the plateau, in some cases from one trial to the next. Trains of high frequency APs had no effect. Finally, experimental inhibition during learning of the distal dendritic region responsible for initiating plateaus reduced the rate of population level adaptation. Our findings suggest that the deep layers of higher order visual cortex possess a rapid learning mechanism mediated by plateau-induced synaptic plasticity.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with Graves\u2019 disease and hepatic dysfunction: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.
