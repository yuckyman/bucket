      "title": "Emergence of Individualized Functional Topography in the Neonatal Brain",
      "content": "The early postnatal period represents a critical phase for establishing the brain's fundamental architecture. However, how individualized functional topography emerges and shapes long-term cognition remains unknown. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from 419 neonates, we map personalized functional topographies in the first weeks of life and reveal their association with 18-month neurocognitive outcomes. Unique and stable functional topographies are already present at birth, with interindividual variability organized along a conserved sensorimotor-to-association hierarchy. These individualized maps encode early brain maturity and robustly predict cognitive, language, and motor outcomes at 18-month of age, with predictive features concentrated at network boundaries. This functional refinement is structurally anchored by concurrent maturation in cortical myelination and sulcal depth. Preterm birth results in distinctive topographic alterations characterized by accelerated maturation of association networks. Our work establishes a foundation for precision models of early brain development and elucidates its significance for long-term neurocognitive outcomes.",

      "title": "Association between white-matter lesion volume and heart-rate variability: A comparison of T1, T1-T2 and T1-FLAIR-based segmentations using FreeSurfer SAMSEG",
      "content": "Background: Heart disease is a crucial risk factor for brain degeneration, but the exact mechanisms are still under investigation. Notably, a growth in white-matter lesion (WML) volume, a hallmark of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) with connections to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, has been linked to cardiovascular disease. As such, measures of cardiovascular function such as heart rate variability may represent early and accessible predictors of WML development. Methods: This study used data from healthy adults drawn from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (LEMON) dataset to examine heart function through measures of heart rate variability (HRV), as well as their relationship to cSVD as quantified through WML volumes, using FreeSurfer SAMSEG. WML volumes were segmented using 3T T1+FLAIR, T1+T2 or T1 images alone. Results: Results indicate that both young and old adults exhibited WMLs, and that lower HRV was associated with higher WML volume. This was particularly strong for high-frequency HRV across both young and older adults, but it was low-frequency HRV that was related to WML volume in an age-specific manner. Moreover, we showed that the WML-HRV relationship that is apparent using T1+FLAIR or T1+T2 based WML volumes could be observed even with T1w-based WML estimation alone. Conclusions: These results suggest HRV not only as an avenue through which cardiovascular risk translates into brain degeneration, but also as a potential early and readily measurable non-invasive predictor of later WML development and cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "A ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens pathway regulates impulsivity",
      "content": "Heightened impulsivity is attributed with substance abuse disorders, gambling, and obesity. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has recently been linked with impulse control, yet the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms through which this control occurs are unknown. A subset of vHPC neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (ACB), a brain region known for regulating reward and motivation. Here, we evaluated the role of vHPC-ACB signaling in food-directed impulsivity using fiber photometry and transsynaptic chemogenetic and behavioral approaches. Male and female rats were trained in the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) test of impulsive action, where they learn to withhold lever presses for 20 seconds to obtain a palatable food reward. Photometry recordings during DRL revealed analogous elevations in calcium-dependent activity in the vHPC and ACB during the 5s immediately prior to a non-impulsive vs. an impulsive response. Chemogenetic silencing of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons elevated impulsive responses in DRL relative to vehicle treatment in males but not females, yet had no effect on home cage food intake, operant-based motivation to work for palatable food, impulsive choice, or anxiety-like behavior. To determine whether this impulse control circuit requires vHPC->ACB communication independent of collateral targets of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons, we utilized a novel transsynaptic viral approach to selectively silence ACB neurons that receive synaptic glutamatergic signaling from the vHPC. Results reveal that inhibition of ACB neurons receiving vHPC signaling elevates impulsive action in the DRL task relative to vehicle treatment. Collective results reveal a hippocampal-striatal circuit that regulates impulsive action in males.",

Where possible it uses the vendored <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/fd\"><code>fd</code></a> binary for fast file searches and can optionally locally cache file paths of the full collection for even faster searches (great for collections stored on the network, where file scanning is usually slow).</p> <p>It's a simple, straight-forward tool for people who prefer the terminal over GUI-based alternatives and just want to find and play files based on filename. Can be configured directly in the CLI (or by editing the configuration file if you prefer).</p> <p>It currently plays files in VLC (separate install). I will probably switch to using mpv in a future version as that makes implementing the planned &quot;resume&quot; feature a lot easier.</p> <p>Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p> <p><strong>Target

      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",
