      "title": "Show HN: Grov \u2013 Multiplayer for AI coding agents",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Tony.<p>I built Grov (<a href=\"https://grov.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://grov.dev/</a>) because I hit a wall with current AI coding assistants: they are \"single-player.\" The moment I kill a terminal pane or close a chat session, the high-level reasoning and architectural decisions generated during that session are lost. If a teammate touches that same code an hour later, their agent has to re-derive everything from scratch or read many documentation files for basically any feature implemented or bug fixed.<p>I wanted to stop writing a lot of docs for everything just to give context to my agents or have to re-explain to my agents what my teammate did and why.<p>Grov is an open-source context layer that effectively gives your team's AI agents a shared, persistent memory.<p>Here is the technical approach:<p>1. Decision-grain memory, not document storage: When you sync a memory, Grov structures knowledge at the decision level. We capture the specific aspect (e.g., \"Auth Strategy\"), the choice made (\"JWT\"), and the reasoning (\"Stateless for scaling\"). Crucially, when your codebase evolves, we don't overwrite memories, we mark old decisions as superseded and link them to the new choice. This gives your team an audit trail of architectural evolution, not just the current snapshot.<p>2. Git-like branches for memories: Teams experimenting with different approaches can create memory branches. Memories on a feature branch stay isolated until you are ready to merge. Access control mirrors Git: main is team-wide, while feature branches keep noise isolated. When you merge the branch, those accumulated insights become instantly available to everyone's agents.<p>3. Two-stage injection (Token Optimization): The expensive part of shared memory isn't storage it's the context window. Loading 10 irrelevant memories wastes tokens and confuses the model. Grov uses a \"Preview \u2192 Expand\" strategy:\n Preview: A hybrid semantic/keyword search returns lightweight memory summaries (~100 tokens). \n Expand: The full reasoning traces (~500-1k tokens) are only injected if the agent explicitly requests more detail. This typically results in a 50-70% token reduction per session compared to raw context dumping.<p>The result: Your teammate's agent doesn't waste 5 minutes re-exploring why you chose Postgres over Redis, or re-reading auth middleware. It just knows, because your agent already figured it out and shared it.<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",

      "title": "Tonically active interneurons gate motor output in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "Tonic inhibition and its transient removal are fundamental neural mechanisms for gating activity, suppressing out-of-phase excitation, and enhancing the temporal precision of behavior. However, their roles within locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify A02l neurons - segmentally repeated excitatory interneurons in the Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) - that regulate crawling behavior through tonic inhibition. A02l neurons exhibit high baseline activity and are transiently suppressed during motor output. They provide excitatory input to inhibitory premotor networks, enabling widespread silencing of motor neurons to maintain muscle relaxation. Optogenetic activation of A02l neurons reduced crawling frequency, whereas their inhibition induced transient whole-body contractions. Together, these findings reveal a cellular-resolution mechanism for tonic inhibition within the nerve cord and highlight its importance in gating motor output and maintaining motor quiescence.",

      "content": "Functioning both as the site of cerebrospinal fluid production and as an interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system, the choroid plexus (ChP) modulates the gating of immune cells and signals from the periphery as they pass from the blood into cerebrospinal fluid. We generated a single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the adult human ChP, in donors with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing transcriptionally and spatially distinct macrophage states. We identified a previously unrecognized population of titin-expressing (TTN+) tissue-resident macrophages characterized by coordinated activation of cytoskeletal remodeling, phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory programs. Isoform-specific qPCR, protein immunofluorescence, and single-molecule FISH validated TTN expression in situ. In AD, TTN+ macrophages expand and undergo broad transcriptional rewiring, including activation of MEF2-linked mechanotransduction pathways, elevated senescence signatures, and a loss of ligand-receptor connectivity with epithelial, endothelial, and stromal partners. Collectively, our findings define a mechanosensitive macrophage program at the blood-CSF interface and uncover a TTN-associated shift in macrophage function and microenvironment integration in AD.",

It\u2019s focused entirely on outbound alerts, ideal for scripts, bots, or internal tools that need to notify a user or group via Telegram as a free service.</p> <p>No webhook setup, no conversational interface, just direct message delivery using HTTPX under the hood.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>from pingram import Pingram bot = Pingram(token=&quot;&lt;your-token&gt;&quot;) bot.message(chat_id=123456789, text=&quot;Backup complete&quot;) </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Pingram is designed for:</p> <ul> <li>Developers who want fast, scriptable messaging without conversational features</li> <li>Users replacing email/SMS alerts in cron jobs, containers, or monitoring tools</li> <li>Python devs looking for a minimal alternative to heavier Telegram bot frameworks</li> <li>Projects that want to embed notifications without requiring stateful servers or polling</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s production-usable for simple alerting use cases but not intended for full-scale bot development.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Compared to python-telegram-bot, Telethon, or aiogram:</p> <ul> <li>Pingram is &lt;100 LOC, no event loop, no polling, no webhooks \u2014 just a clean HTTP client</li> <li>Faster to integrate for one-off use cases like \u201csend this report\u201d or \u201cnotify on job success\u201d</li> <li>Easier to audit, minimal API surface, and no external dependencies beyond httpx</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s more of a messaging transport layer than a full bot framework.</p> <p>Would appreciate thoughts, use cases, or suggestions.
