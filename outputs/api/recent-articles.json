      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Reconfiguration of Premotor Excitation and Inhibition Drives Behavior-Specific Protopodium Dynamics in Drosophila Larvae",
      "content": "Animals use the same muscles to generate distinct locomotor behaviors, raising the question of how shared motor systems produce behavior-specific outputs. In Drosophila larvae, forward and backward crawling recruit largely overlapping motor pools but differ in the timing of ventral oblique (VO) muscle activation, which occurs late in forward crawling and early in backward crawling. Although this timing difference has been described, the circuit mechanisms that impose it and its functional significance have remained unclear. Here, we show that VO muscles are primary drivers of protopodium movement, a limb-like structure involved in substrate engagement during crawling, and that their behavior-specific activation timing is controlled by a tri-segmental premotor circuit. Using muscle calcium imaging, optogenetic and connectome-based circuit analysis, and biomechanical modeling, we identify a feedforward inhibitory motif composed of two previously characterized excitatory premotor neurons (A27h and A18b3) and the inhibitory premotor neuron A06c. During forward crawling, A06c exhibits a biphasic activity pattern that defines a narrow temporal window for VO contraction and prevents premature, multi-segmental VO activation. During backward crawling, this premotor configuration is disengaged: A27h and A18b3 are inactive, and the initial inhibitory peak of A06c is absent, permitting earlier VO activation. Disrupting this circuit causes premature VO activation, impaired protopodium folding, compressed intersegmental coordination, and reduced forward crawling efficiency. Together, our findings show how reconfiguration of premotor excitation and inhibition generates behavior-specific muscle dynamics within a shared motor system.",

Searching around a bit, it was very hard to find a single source or interactive map of active beacons, and a description of what the \"characteristic\" meant. The Coast Guard maintains a list of active lights though, that they publish annually (<a href=\"https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication</a>). With some help from Claude Code, it wasn't hard to extract the lat/long and put together a small webapp that shows a map of these light stations and illustrates their characteristic with an animated visualization..<p>Of course, this shouldn't be used as a navigational aid, merely for informational purposes!

      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

      "title": "How the olfactory bulb maintains stable odor manifolds amid adaptation and representational drift",
      "content": "Adaptive coding in sensory circuits enables stable perception while accommodating experience-dependent changes. In the olfactory bulb (OB), repeated odor exposure reshapes population activity even without explicit behavioral feedback, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. By analyzing longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging datasets from the mouse OB, we identified three concurrent forms of representational change: gain adaptation, similarity-dependent pattern separation or convergence, and a rotation of encoding subspace resulting in the representational drift. Using a computational model of the mitral cell-granule cell circuit, we showed that Hebbian plasticity and structural connectivity constraints are sufficient to reproduce these transformations. Despite global representational drift, the relative geometry of odor response vectors remained stable, preserving a low-dimensional odor manifold. Together, our results reveal how local plasticity and network structure jointly enable both stability and flexibility in early sensory coding.",
