      "title": "A Lightweight Deep Learning Architecture for Potato Leaf Disease Detection: A Comprehensive Survey",
      "content": "Potato leaf diseases pose a serious challenge to global food security, often leading to considerable yield losses if not detected promptly. The growing maturity of deep learning has enabled automated, high-precision plant disease recognition, even on devices with limited computational resources. In this study, several lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models--MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), EfficientNet-Lite, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet--are comparatively assessed for the task of potato leaf disease classification. The models were trained under identical preprocessing and fine-tuning conditions, incorporating checkpoint-based training for stability. Among the evaluated networks, ShuffleNet delivered the highest overall performance with 99% accuracy, 0.97 precision, 0.99 recall, and an F1-score of 0.98, making it well-suited for real-time field deployment. EfficientNet-Lite also demonstrated a strong balance between speed and accuracy (91.9%), outperforming both MobileNet variants. Conversely, SqueezeNet, though the most compact model, recorded lower metrics (76% accuracy), indicating limited feature discrimination capability. This analysis underscores the balance between efficiency, robustness, and predictive accuracy, providing practical insights for deploying deep learning models in precision agriculture and low-resource environments.",

      "title": "A Novel Cell-Type Specific Circadian Reporter Mouse Reveals Self-Sustained Food Entrainable Nature in Enteric Neurons",
      "content": "Global luciferase reporter gene technology is an important real-time readout for the analysis of circadian oscillations. However, because nearly all cells in the body possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, developing cell-type-specific reporter systems is essential to dissect how these oscillators interact within complex multicellular tissues and are modulated by brain-body circadian signals. The intestine is a complex organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct origins and functions, and it exhibits robust daily rhythms in physiological activities driven by intrinsic circadian clocks. While the circadian regulation of the mucosal compartment, including the intestinal epithelium, has been relatively well characterized, the mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms in the cells of the muscularis externa remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel Cre-dependent Per2-luciferase reporter mouse that enables precise measurement of circadian oscillations in specific peripheral cell populations ex vivo and demonstrate its utility in revealing the hierarchical circadian chrono-architecture within the intestine. Ex vivo gut explants from mice expressing the reporter in one of five major cell types of the muscularis externa-enteric neurons (ENs), enteric glial cells (EGCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and muscularis macrophages (MMs)-exhibited robust, self-sustained circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that all of these cell types possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators. Notably, ENs in the small intestine entrained more rapidly to feeding schedules than did those in the colon, revealing regional differences in food entrainment among the gut clocks. Moreover, the clocks of ENs, SMCs, and MMs shifted their phase in response to daytime-restricted feeding, whereas ICC clocks remained unaffected even after three weeks of restricted feeding. These findings demonstrate that distinct intestinal cell types possess unique entrainment properties and that feeding rhythms can induce heterogeneous phase shifts within the gut clocks. Given that circadian disruption, such as that caused by shift work, contributes to intestinal disorders, this reporter system could provide a powerful platform to dissect the mechanisms linking intercellular circadian desynchrony to intestinal homeostasis.",

      "content": "Fearful-expression recognition is vital for survival, relying on rapid fear detection and fine-grained face encoding. However, how human amygdala subregions differentially implement these distinct cognitive components remains unclear. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from lateral and medial amygdala in epilepsy patients performing an emotional face-matching task, and combined multivariate decoding, time-frequency and directed-connectivity analyses with intracranial stimulation. We found that the lateral subregion exhibited early, fear-specific theta/alpha-band (4-12 Hz) activity with higher decoding accuracy and directed transfer of fear-specific information to the medial subregion, which showed delayed and sustained activation. By contrast, the medial subregion encoded face-specific information at a later stage in the 2-16 Hz band with superior decoding accuracy, and then relayed this information back to the lateral subregion. Critically, intracranial stimulation yielded double-dissociable behavioural effects, with lateral stimulation disrupting early fear detection while medial stimulation accelerated neutral-face recognition. Together, our study delineates a hierarchically organized, temporally structured division of labour within the human amygdala and show that dynamic interactions underlie hierarchical processing of fearful expressions.",

      "title": "Eigenmode decomposition of asymmetries in whole-brain effective connectivity reveals multiscale hierarchical dynamics",
      "content": "The human brain is a complex, hierarchical system operating far from equilibrium, yet the mechanisms linking its directed network architecture to temporal irreversibility remain largely unknown. While prior studies have revealed functional and structural hierarchies, no framework has captured the hierarchical organization of the brain's directed network in relation to its non-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we present the first large-scale eigendecomposition of whole-brain effective connectivity (EC), estimated from resting-state fMRI using sparse Dynamic Causal Modeling. We isolate the irreversible component of EC, which encodes the directionality of information flow and forms a comprehensive hierarchical network of forward and backward interactions. This hierarchy strengthens in brain states approaching criticality, where slow, oscillatory modes dominate and reflects the influence of long-range anatomical connections that scaffold whole-brain information flow. Our decomposition provides the first multiscale quantification of temporal irreversibility, revealing dual counterpropagating streams along the unimodal-transmodal axis operating at distinct frequencies. Crucially, these hierarchical dynamics carry robust, individual-specific signatures, with unimodal networks contributing disproportionately to subject identifiability. Altogether, this work delivers the first dynamic, whole-brain characterization of effective connectivity-derived hierarchies across spatiotemporal scales and individuals, offering a unified framework for studying brain hierarchy, non-equilibrium dynamics, and subject identifiability.",

      "title": "CochleaNet: deep learning-based image analysis for cochlear connectomics and gene therapy",
      "content": "With the emergence of gene and optogenetic therapies targeting deafness, the comprehensive analysis of the molecular anatomy and physiology of the cochlea has become ever more important. Here, we introduce CochleaNet, a deep learning-based framework to analyze volumetric imaging data obtained by light-sheet microscopy of decalcified, cleared and fluorescently labeled cochleae. CochleaNet covers the workflow from reconstruction of the cochlea to segmentation of inner hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons and their afferent synapses, to analyzing the expression of gene therapy products. We validated CochleaNet by comparison to manual image analysis. Trained on high isotropic resolution mouse data, CochleaNet was also applicable to the cochlea of the gerbil, another relevant animal model, and lower-resolution mouse data from a commercially available microscope. We conclude that the combination of light-sheet microscopy and image analysis with CochleaNet paves the way for rapid and reliable quantification of cochlear molecular anatomy and preclinical gene therapy outcomes.",
