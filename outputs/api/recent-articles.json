      "title": "Hidden Spirals Reveal Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Traveling Waves in Human Memory",
      "content": "Traveling waves are neural oscillations that progressively propagate across the cortex in specific directions and spatial patterns, however, their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To probe their mechanisms, we analyzed direct brain recordings from humans performing a working memory task using empirical statistical modeling and computational modeling. By using independent component analysis, we showed that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in complex spatial patterns that correlated with behaviors such as memory encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. We also applied a novel computational model to identify novel complex spatial patterns, using coupled phase oscillators to reveal hidden spirals that were not clearly visible in the original recordings. The orientation of these hidden spirals distinguished between separate cognitive states, such as memory encoding and retrieval. Our simultaneous empirical and computational modeling provides a general framework to probe the functional significance and neurocomputational mechanisms underlying a diverse range of spatial patterns of traveling waves. Importantly, our novel model-based analytical approach can identify new types of traveling waves in the brain that are missed with conventional analysis approaches.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "title": "Deep learning methods for 3D tracking of fish in challenging underwater conditions for future perception in autonomous underwater vehicles",
      "content": "Due to their utility in replacing workers in tasks unsuitable for humans, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have become increasingly common tools in the fish farming industry. However, earlier studies and anecdotal evidence from farmers imply that farmed fish tend to move away from and avoid intrusive objects such as vehicles that are deployed and operated inside net pens. Such responses could imply a discomfort associated with the intrusive objects, which, in turn, can lead to stress and...",

      "content": "As aquaculture expands to meet global food demand, it remains dependent on manual, costly, infrequent, and high-risk operations due to reliance on high-end Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Scalable and autonomous systems are needed to enable safer and more efficient practices. This paper proposes a cost-effective autonomous inspection framework for the monitoring of mooring systems, a critical component ensuring structural integrity and regulatory compliance for both the aquaculture and...",

Attention- and feature-attribution analyses improved transparency, supporting clinical interpretability. Future work should scale to larger, multimodal (text/audio/vision) and multilingual datasets, and develop...",

Cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness, accounting for over 75% of cases. While volunteer cataract surgery programs operate throughout the country, resource limitations often preclude comprehensive pre- and post-operative assessments, including standardized visual function testing.
