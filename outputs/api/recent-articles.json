      "title": "DGAT1-dependent lipid droplet synthesis in microglia attenuates neuroinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharides.",
      "content": "Lipid droplets (LD) are dynamic storage organelles for triglycerides (TG). LD act as a hub that modulates the availability of fatty acids to sustain metabolic needs and the generation of fatty-acid derived signals. Recent evidence demonstrates that LD metabolism regulates immune responses including in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. We have previously shown that blocking LD lipolysis in microglia reduces acute pro-inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including cytokine and prostanoid synthesis. Here, we investigated the role of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of TG synthesis, in microglial LD biogenesis and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. We found that treatment with LPS downregulates specific enzymes in the TG synthesis pathway in primary microglia, including GPAT1, AGPAT3, AGPAT5, and DGAT1, while upregulating TMEM68, a non-canonical TG synthesizing enzyme. Pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 significantly reduced LD formation in both oleate- and LPS-stimulated conditions, indicating that DGAT1 is essential for inflammation-induced LD synthesis. Moreover, DGAT1 inhibition selectively decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1{beta}, without affecting IL-6, CCL2, or the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}. These findings show, that DGAT1-dependent LD formation acts as an important modulator of microglial inflammatory signaling.",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",
