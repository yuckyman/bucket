      "title": "Signatures of remote planning in hippocampal replay",
      "content": "During brief, intermittent \"replay\" events, hippocampal activity can express navigational trajectories disconnected from both when and where they originally occurred. While replay biased toward immediate future goals has been observed, there is no evidence yet linking replay to planning beyond the next action. Here, we designed a sequential spatial working memory task which required rats to utilize information across multiple temporally separated actions. Remote replay events matched the animal's future navigational choices made after completing an intervening subtask. Critically, this occurred only when the replayed information was useful for reducing memory load, consistent with it being an active process. Our findings suggest these remote replay events are a neural correlate of episodic forethought, allowing animals to use memories to plan beyond their immediate surroundings.",

      "title": "Rapid robust high-fidelity 3D neuronal extraction from multi-view projections",
      "content": "Recent developments in imaging facilitate large-scale three-dimensional (3D) neuronal recording. While these huge amounts of data shed new light on population-level neural coding, it is much harder to extract neuronal calcium dynamics from 3D volumes than 2D images with the existence of noise and scattering. Here, we presented DeepWonder3D, a general end-to-end pipeline for rapid and robust 3D neuronal extraction with high fidelity. Instead of processing voxel by voxel, DeepWonder3D works on the multi-view projections of 3D imaging data obtained either digitally or optically through specific point spread functions (PSFs) for general applicability to diverse techniques, including point-scanning microscopy, light-field microscopy, and two-photon synthetic aperture microscopy. Integrating denoising, resolution registration, background removal, neuronal extraction, and multi-view fusion into a unified pipeline tailored for large-scale high-resolution datasets contaminated by noise and scattering, DeepWonder3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D localization accuracy with a 10-fold reduction in computational costs, validated by numerical simulations and a hybrid two-photon/light-field imaging system. With the RUSH3D mesoscope, DeepWonder3D achieves rapid high-fidelity 3D calcium extraction of tens of thousands of neurons across the mouse cortex within hours.",

      "title": "Awareness is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based motor attenuation",
      "content": "Predictive coding theories posit that the brain continuously updates internal models of the world to anticipate sensory input. Attenuation of neural responses to predictable sensory stimuli is thought to aid in this process of prediction error detection and model updating. The topic of whether predictive processes such as sensory attenuation can occur in minimally conscious states has been hotly debated. The current study provides a novel test for the role of awareness in prediction-based attenuation using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) prediction task, whereby predictable stimulation is known to lead to attenuated motor system excitability. The experiment tested whether motor attenuation can occur without awareness using a dual task paradigm to mask a predictive cueing relationship. Participants simultaneously completed an n-back task and a TMS-counting task; critically, a visual cue (in the n-back task) consistently predicted the occurrence of a TMS pulse (in the counting task). Instruction conditions manipulated how much participants were informed of this relationship, and awareness was assessed in a post-experimental questionnaire. The results reveal that motor attenuation was present only in participants instructed about the relationship, or in those who became aware of the cue-TMS association. Implicit, predictable cue-TMS exposure was not sufficient to elicit motor attenuation in unaware participants. These findings show that awareness of the relationship is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based attenuation in the motor system, challenging the assumption that predictive coding operates automatically.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been developing a new random number generator called RGE-256, and I wanted to share the NumPy implementation with the Python community since it has become one of the most useful versions for general testing, statistics, and exploratory work.</p> <p>The project started with a core engine that I published as rge256_core on PyPI. It implements a 256-bit ARX-style generator with a rotation schedule that comes from some geometric research I have been doing. After that foundation was stable, I built two extensions: TorchRGE256 for machine learning workflows and NumPy RGE-256 for pure Python and scientific use. NumPy RGE-256 is where most of the statistical analysis has taken place. Because it avoids GPU overhead and deep learning frameworks, it is easy to generate large batches, run chi-square tests, check autocorrelation, inspect distributions, and experiment with tuning or structural changes. With the resources I have available, I was only able to run Dieharder on 128 MB of output instead of the 6\u20138 GB the suite usually prefers. Even with this limitation, RGE-256 passed about 84 percent of the tests, failed only three, and the rest came back as weak. Weak results usually mean the test suite needs more data before it can confirm a pass, not that the generator is malfunctioning. With full multi-gigabyte testing and additional fine-tuning of the rotation constants, the results should improve further.</p> <p>For people who want to try the algorithm without installing anything, I also built a standalone browser demo. It shows histograms, scatter plots, bit patterns, and real-time statistics as values are generated, and it runs entirely offline in a single HTML file.</p> <p>TorchRGE256 is also available for PyTorch users. The NumPy version is the easiest place to explore how the engine behaves as a mathematical object. It is also the version I would recommend if you want to look at the internals, compare it with other generators, or experiment with parameter tuning.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>Core Engine (PyPI): pip install rge256_core<br /> NumPy Version: pip install numpyrge256<br /> PyTorch Version: pip install torchrge256<br /> GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/RRG314\">https://github.com/RRG314</a><br /> Browser Demo: <a href=\"https://rrg314.github.io/RGE-256-app/\">https://rrg314.github.io/RGE-256-app/</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/RRG314/RGE-256-app\">https://github.com/RRG314/RGE-256-app</a></p> <p>I would appreciate any feedback, testing, or comparisons.

It has no dependencies by default and uses method based routing inspired by CherryPy. Here is a quick (and pointless) example:</p> <p>``` from micropie import App</p> <p>class Root(App):</p> <pre><code>def greet(self, name=&quot;world&quot;): return f&quot;Hello {name}!&quot; </code></pre> <p>app = Root() ```</p> <p>That would map to <code>localhost:8000/greet</code> and take the optional param <code>name</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>/greet</code> -&gt; <code>Hello world!</code></li> <li><code>/greet/Stewie</code> -&gt; <code>Hello Stewie!</code></li> <li><code>/greet?name=Brian</code> -&gt; <code>Hello Brian!</code></li> </ul> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>Web developers looking for a simple way to prototype or quickly deploy simple micro services and apps. Students looking to broaden their knowledge of ASGI.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>MicroPie can be compared to Starlette and other ASGI (and WSGI) frameworks. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/micropie/blob/main/README.md#comparisons\">comparison section in the README</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/micropie/blob/main/README.md#benchmark-results\">benchmarks section</a>.</p> <h3>Whats new in v0.24?</h3> <p>This release I improved session handling when using the development-only <code>InMemorySessionBackend</code>. Expired sessions now clean up properly, and empty sessions delete stored data. Session saving also moved after <code>after_request</code> middleware that way you can mutate the session with middleware properly. See <a href=\"https://thoughts.harrisonerd.com/post/6930ec8c8f2b97dac838c8d8\">full changelog here</a>.</p> <p>MicroPie is in active beta development.

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) present with complex behavioral symptoms that can arise in the absence of overt structural brain damage. Recent evidence suggests that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) located at the brain\u2019s interfaces regulate central nervous system function, yet the specific roles of distinct BAM subsets remain largely undefined. By reanalyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem PD brains, we identified a BAM subset expressing CD169 that was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. To examine their function, we employed CD169-DTR mice to selectively ablate CD169+ BAMs and evaluated behavioral and histological changes. Depletion of CD169+ BAMs induced tremors, abnormal hindlimb reflexes, and heightened anxiety-like behavior without dopaminergic neuron loss. Histological analysis revealed a pronounced reduction of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, indicating disruption of olfactory-limbic circuitry. These findings demonstrate that CD169+ BAMs are critical for maintaining neural network stability and motor function, and that their loss can elicit PD-like phenotypes in the absence of classical dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work establishes a novel mouse model linking brain-border immune cell dysfunction to Parkinsonian pathology and highlights a neuroimmune mechanism that may contribute to the onset of PD-like disorders.",

Pick the '96 Bulls, face off against the '17 Warriors, and YOU decide whether MJ passes to Pippen or takes the shot.</p> <p>I spent way too much time on this, but it's actually pretty fun:</p> <p>- 23 championship teams from different eras (Bill Russell's Celtics to last year's Celtics) </p> <p>- You control every possession - pass, shoot, make subs</p> <p>- Built in some era-balancing so the '72 Lakers don't get completely destroyed by modern spacing</p> <p>- Used the Rich library for the UI (first time using it, pretty cool)</p> <p>The whole thing runs in your terminal. Single keypress controls, no waiting around.</p> <p>Not gonna lie, I've dabbled with Python mostly on the data science/analytics side but I consider this my first real project and I'm kinda nervous putting it out there. But figured worst case, maybe someone else who loves basketball and Python will get a kick out of it.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/raym26/classic-nba-simulator-text-game\">https://github.com/raym26/classic-nba-simulator-text-game</a></p> <p>It's free/open source.

      "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
      "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",
