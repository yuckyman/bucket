      "title": "Hierarchical and Context-Dependent Encoding of Actions in Human Posterior Parietal and Motor Cortex",
      "content": "Action understanding requires internal models that link vision to motor goals. In monkeys, mirror neurons demonstrate motor resonance during observation, but single-unit evidence in humans is limited, leaving open whether such representations rely solely on motor resonance. We recorded neural activity from motor cortex (MC) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) in two tetraplegic participants implanted with Utah arrays while they intended or observed hand actions. MC strongly encoded intention but showed only weak, feature-specific overlap during observation, evident primarily at the population level. SPL, in contrast, supported shared models across intended movement and observation formats at both single-unit and population levels. In variants with incongruent instructed and observed actions, SPL encoded observed actions only when behaviorally relevant, whereas MC remained intention-dominant. Our results identify a context-dependent gating mechanism in SPL and suggest a hierarchical organization in which MC maintains intention-specific codes while SPL flexibly links observed input with internal goals to support action understanding.",

      "title": "Prefrontal cortex and striatum dissociate modality and learning order in cross-modal sensorimotor learning",
      "content": "Sensorimotor learning is accompanied by the emergence and strengthening of sensory responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. However, it remains unclear whether learning-evoked sensory responses in these structures are modality-specific, or whether they represent a more generalized signal for modality-independent but behaviorally relevant stimuli. To address this question, we performed widefield calcium imaging while mice were trained on sensorimotor tasks involving either visual or auditory stimuli, with mice first learning one modality and then switching to the other. We found that the anterior PFC (aPFC) exhibited a bilateral response to both visual and auditory stimuli after learning the respective tasks, indicating a generalized sensory representation. In contrast, the medial PFC (mPFC) showed modality-specific activity, responding only to contralateral visual stimuli after learning. Mice were able to learn sensorimotor associations for both modalities in sequence, and were only able to transfer learned behavior from visual to auditory stimuli but not the reverse. Despite differences in cross-modal learning transfer, cortical responses to learned stimuli were the same regardless of learning order. In contrast, electrophysiological recordings in the anterior striatum revealed that visually responsive regions became co-responsive to auditory stimuli only in mice trained on the visual task first. The additional auditory responses arose from distinct neurons rather than those previously responsive to visual stimuli, indicating that co-responsiveness occurred at the regional rather than single-neuron level. Together, these findings reveal that learned sensory responses in the PFC and striatum uniquely dissociate modality and learning order, suggesting a divergence in their roles during sensorimotor learning.",

      "content": "The landmark ongoing HEALthy Brain and Cognitive Development (HBCD) study will longitudinally chart brain development in a large sample (projected n=7,200) of infants through age 10 years with multimodal neuroimaging that includes an advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisition. Here, we detail advances in dMRI image processing developed for HBCD, incorporated into the widely used QSIPrep pipeline. Major changes to preprocessing include improvements in infant brain extraction, distortion correction, and normalization to infant-specific templates. Additionally, we describe a new software package - QSIRecon - that yields rich derived data including diverse maps of tissue microstructure as well as person-specific white matter bundles. Using dMRI data from a subset of the HBCD 1.0 release where age information was available (n=529 sessions across two time points), we observe critical improvements in data quality with preprocessing and see expected developmental patterns. Moving forward, the publicly-available data from HBCD will rapidly grow to become the largest study of brain development in infancy and early childhood using dMRI. QSIPrep and QSIRecon are openly available and can be applied to other infant and pediatric dMRI datasets.",

      "title": "Proteomic profile of hippocampal growth cones through early postnatal development",
      "content": "The early postnatal period represents a critical window for neural circuit assembly in the developing hippocampus. Growth cones (GCs) play essential roles in establishing connectivity patterns, yet their proteomic composition during this dynamic developmental phase remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed comprehensive proteomic profiling of GCs isolated from the whole hippocampus (HP-GCs) and dentate gyrus (DG-GCs) across the first five postnatal days (P1, P3, P5) in mice. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis revealed that GCs from both regions are highly similar at P1, subsequently diverging. This earliest timepoint seems to be characterized by a high metabolic demand. Developmental trajectories of the GCs from the two subregions then start to differ, with P3 being a very dynamic period for HP-GCs, with GO terms related to RNA splicing, and a transition towards synapse formation by P5. On the contrary, DG-GCs seem to still be in an exploratory phase by P5, suggesting a delayed maturation and reflecting the later time course of the invasion of EC layer 2 Reelin-positive axons into this region. We identified over 5,000 proteins, with each timepoint characterized by distinct protein subsets. Temporal trajectory analysis revealed key GC markers including DCC, DPSYL2, and FABP7, which showed dynamic regulation across development. Notably, we identified multiple proteins containing nuclear localization sequences, suggesting bidirectional communication between GCs and the nucleus during critical developmental periods. Furthermore, our dataset contains over 400 proteins associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with twenty showing temporal regulation, highlighting the potential relevance of early developmental disruptions to disease pathogenesis. These findings provide a comprehensive proteomic resource for understanding GC function during hippocampal circuit formation and offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying region-specific developmental timelines in the brain.",

      "title": "A lobule-specific neuronal representation of song temporal structure in the songbird cerebellum",
      "content": "The cerebellum is involved in the acquisition and production of speech as revealed by clinical evidence and imaging studies, but its specific role however remains unclear. Songbirds provide a unique model to study the neural mechanisms of speech learning and production. Recent evidence highlights a contribution of the cerebellum to syllable duration in songbirds. Here, we aim at better understanding how and which cerebellar circuits may contribute to the tight control of syllable duration in zebra finches. We first confirmed that lesions in the lateral cerebellum affect syllable duration. We then recorded neuronal activity in the various cerebellar lobules in response to song playback and during singing with or without auditory feedback perturbation. We found that many cerebellar lobules receive non-selective auditory information locked to syllable boundaries during song playback, both in anaesthetized and awake behaving birds. During singing, cerebellar neurons in several lobules display song-locked responses with varying degrees of alignment to their playback responses and no alteration during auditory feedback perturbation. Singing-related activity tends to correlate with the fluctuations in syllable duration rather than any acoustic song feature. Importantly, neurons in lobule IV of the cerebellum are largely unaffected by auditory stimulation but display syllable-locked firing rate modulations during singing that precisely encode syllable boundaries with a sharp and tight increase in firing at syllable onsets and offsets. Altogether, our findings reveal cerebellar signals that may contribute to the control of the duration of vocal elements during singing, possibly serving as a forward model of song temporal features.",

      "title": "Theta Activity Supports Landmark-Based Correction of Naturalistic Human Path Integration",
      "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

      "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>",

      "title": "Walking Modulates Active Auditory Sensing",
      "content": "<p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>",

      "title": "TREK1 Channels Shape Spindle-Like Oscillations, Neuronal Activity, and Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity in Thalamocortical Circuits",
      "content": "<p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<sub>2P</sub> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>",

      "title": "Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed Fibril-Induced Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation Model",
      "content": "<p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>",

      "title": "The Top-Down of Prefrontal Cortex to the Hippocampus Glutamatergic Pathway Regulates Reward Memory of Methamphetamine",
      "content": "<p>Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that readily establishes reward memories contributing to METH relapse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>",

      "title": "Learning to Program \"Recycles\" Preexisting Frontoparietal Population Codes of Logical Algorithms",
      "content": "<p>Computer programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet little is known about how the human brain enables this recently invented cultural skill. According to the neural recycling hypothesis, cultural skills (e.g., reading, math) repurpose preexisting neural \"information maps.\" Alternatively, such maps could emerge de novo during learning, as they do in artificial neural networks. Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get \"recycled\"? College students (<i>n</i> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction. Programming recycles preexisting representations of logical algorithms in frontoparietal cortices, supporting the recycling framework of cultural skill acquisition.</p>",

      "content": "Objective. Magnetomyography (MMG) using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) offers a contactless, non-invasive approach to assess muscle activity. However, fluctuations in the sensor-to-source distance during MMG recordings pose a significant challenge to accurate signal interpretation since amplitude decays with distance. No established method exists for MMG to continuously monitor sensor-to-source distance changes in real-time. Approach. This study presents a new non-magnetic, cost-effective solution using a digital fiber optic sensor to continuously measure the distance between an OPM and the subject\u2019s skin. Following sensor calibration, distance measurements were recorded during an isometric muscle fatigue task in five healthy participants to assess whether MMG amplitude changes were due to physiological effects or variations in sensor-to-source distance. Alongside OPM-MMG and distance tracking, electromyography (EMG), the neurophysiological gold standard, was simultaneously recorded. Main results. We found significant changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue that were not merely explained by changes in sensor-to-source distance. Furthermore, we found substantial correlations between OPM-MMG and EMG that were strongest for small sensor-to-source distance (r = 0.91). Significance. Fiber optic sensors offer non-magnetic, precise, real-time monitoring of the distance between the OPM and the skin, making it ideal for MMG applications to account for distance-related variability during measurements. Our results suggest that changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue reflect genuine physiological effects rather than distance confounds.",
