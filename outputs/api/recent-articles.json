      "content": "arXiv:2509.13679v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The wide adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in everyday life highlights the need for greater literacy around its evolving capabilities, biases, and limitations. While many AI literacy efforts focus on children through game-based learning, few interventions support adults in developing a nuanced, reflective understanding of GenAI via playful exploration. To address the gap, we introduce ImaginAItion, a multiplayer party game inspired by Drawful and grounded in the reflective play framework to surface model defaults, biases, and human-AI perception gaps through prompting and discussion. From ten sessions (n=30), we show how gameplay helped adults recognize systematic biases in GenAI, reflect on humans and AI interpretation differences, and adapt their prompting strategies. We also found that group dynamics and composition, such as expertise and diversity, amplified or muted reflection. Our work provides a starting point to scale critical GenAI literacy through playful, social interventions resilient to rapidly evolving technologies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13671v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generic AI auto-complete for message composition often fails to capture the nuance of personal identity, requiring significant editing. While harmless in low-stakes settings, for users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, who rely on such systems for everyday communication, this editing burden is particularly acute. Intuitively, the need for edits would be lower if language models were personalized to the communication of the specific user. While technically feasible, such personalization raises socio-technical questions: what are the implications of logging one's own conversations, and how does personalization affect privacy, authorship, and control? We explore these questions through an autoethnographic study in three phases: (1) seven months of collecting all the lead author's AAC communication data, (2) fine-tuning a model on this dataset, and (3) three months of daily use of personalized AI suggestions. We reflect on these phases through continuous diary entries and interaction logs. Our findings highlight the value of personalization as well as implications on privacy, authorship, and blurring the boundaries of self-expression.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13646v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Humans think visually-we remember in images, dream in pictures, and use visual metaphors to communicate. Yet, most creative writing tools remain text-centric, limiting how authors plan and translate ideas. We present Vistoria, a system for synchronized text-image co-editing in fictional story writing that treats visuals and text as coequal narrative materials. A formative Wizard-of-Oz co-design study with 10 story writers revealed how sketches, images, and annotations serve as essential instruments for ideation and organization. Drawing on theories of Instrumental Interaction and Structural Mapping, Vistoria introduces multimodal operations-lasso, collage, filters, and perspective shifts that enable seamless narrative exploration across modalities. A controlled study with 12 participants shows that co-editing enhances expressiveness, immersion, and collaboration, enabling writers to explore divergent directions, embrace serendipitous randomness, and trace evolving storylines. While multimodality increased cognitive demand, participants reported stronger senses of authorship and agency. These findings demonstrate how multimodal co-editing expands creative potential by balancing abstraction and concreteness in narrative development.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13532v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although recent efforts have developed accessible data visualization tools for blind and low-vision (BLV) users, most follow a \"design for them\" approach that creates an unintentional divide between sighted creators and BLV consumers. This unidirectional paradigm perpetuates a power dynamic where sighted creators produce non-visual content boundaries for BLV consumers to access. This paper proposes a bidirectional approach, \"design for us,\" where both sighted and BLV collaborators can employ the same tool to create, interpret, and communicate data visualizations for each other. We introduce Py maidr, a Python package that seamlessly encodes multimodal (e.g., tactile, auditory, conversational) data representations into visual plots generated by Matplotlib and Seaborn. By simply importing the maidr package and invoking the maidr.show() method, users can generate accessible plots with minimal changes to their existing codebase regardless of their visual dis/abilities. Our technical case studies demonstrate how this tool is scalable and can be integrated into interactive computing (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab), reproducible and literate programming (e.g., Quarto), and reactive dashboards (e.g., Shiny, Streamlit). Our performance benchmarks demonstrate that Py maidr introduces minimal and consistent overhead during the rendering and export of plots against Matplotlib and Seaborn baselines. This work significantly contributes to narrowing the accessibility gap in data visualization by providing a unified framework that fosters collaboration and communication between sighted and BLV individuals.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13468v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the growing use of AR in safety-critical domains, the field lacks a systematic understanding of how different types of distraction affect user behavior in AR environments. To address this gap, we present AR-TMT, an AR adaptation of the Trail Making Test that spatially renders targets for sequential selection on the Magic Leap 2. We implemented distractions in three categories: top-down, bottom-up, and spatial distraction based on Wolfe's Guided Search model, and captured performance, gaze, motor behavior, and subjective load measures to analyze user attention and behavior. A user study with 34 participants revealed that top-down distraction degraded performance through semantic interference, while bottom-up distraction disrupted initial attentional engagement. Spatial distraction destabilized gaze behavior, leading to more scattered and less structured visual scanning patterns. We also found that performance was correlated with attention control ($R^2 = .20$--$.35$) under object-based distraction conditions, where distractors possessed task-relevant features. The study offers insights into distraction mechanisms and their impact on users, providing opportunities for generalization to ecologically relevant AR tasks while underscoring the need to address the unique demands of AR environments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13466v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that promotes human dignity and resists over-centralization by balancing personal autonomy with intervention from higher authorities only when necessary. Thus it is a relevant, but not previously explored, critical lens for discerning the tradeoffs between complete user control of software and surrendering control to \"big tech\" for convenience, as is common in surveillance capitalism. Our study explores data privacy through the lens of subsidiarity: we employ a multi-method approach of data flow monitoring and user interviews to determine the level of control different everyday technologies currently operate at, and the level of control everyday computer users think is necessary. We found that chat platforms like Slack and Discord violate subsidiarity the most. Our work provides insight into when users are willing to surrender privacy for convenience and demonstrates how subsidiarity can inform designs that promote human flourishing.",

From a formative study with 12 participants, we found that end-users actively seek to shape generative interfaces rather than relying on one-shot outputs. To address this, we introduce the human-agent co-generation paradigm, materialized in DuetUI. This LLM-empowered system unfolds alongside task progress through a bidirectional context loop--the agent scaffolds the interface by decomposing the task, while the user's direct manipulations implicitly steer the agent's next generation step. In a user study with 24 participants, DuetUI significantly improved task efficiency and interface usability compared to a baseline, fostering seamless human-agent collaboration. Our contributions include the proposal and validation of this novel paradigm, the design of the DuetUI prototype embodying it, and empirical insights into how this bidirectional loop better aligns agents with human intent.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13326v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This full research-to-practice paper explores approaches for developing course chatbots by comparing low-code platforms and custom-coded solutions in educational contexts. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA, LLM-based chatbots are being integrated into teaching workflows to automate tasks, provide assistance, and offer scalable support. However, selecting the optimal development strategy requires balancing ease of use, customization, data privacy, and scalability. This study compares two development approaches: low-code platforms like AnythingLLM and Botpress, with custom-coded solutions using LangChain, FAISS, and FastAPI. The research uses Prompt engineering, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and personalization to evaluate chatbot prototypes across technical performance, scalability, and user experience. Findings indicate that while low-code platforms enable rapid prototyping, they face limitations in customization and scaling, while custom-coded systems offer more control but require significant technical expertise. Both approaches successfully implement key research principles such as adaptive feedback loops and conversational continuity. The study provides a framework for selecting the appropriate development strategy based on institutional goals and resources. Future work will focus on hybrid solutions that combine low-code accessibility with modular customization and incorporate multimodal input for intelligent tutoring systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.13324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) or chatbots, has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human-machine interaction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how to rigorously measure these biases? We aim to address this challenge by proposing a principled framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases.",

      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

      "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

      "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",
