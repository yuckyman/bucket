      "title": "Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10467v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.",

      "title": "Navigating the Ethics of Internet Measurement: Researchers' Perspectives from a Case Study in the EU",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10408v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.",

      "title": "Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10032v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for \"legitimate\" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting \"response instability\"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing \"model instability\"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.10026v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\\% vs. 84.5\\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.",

However, most approaches have primarily focused on generating data from random noise distributions or global, predefined latent embeddings, whereas individualized gaze sequence generation has been less explored. To address this gap, we revisit two recent approaches based on diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and introduce modifications that make both models explicitly subject-aware while improving accuracy and effectiveness. For the diffusion-based approach, we utilize compact user embeddings that emphasize per-subject traits. Moreover, for the GAN-based approach, we propose a subject-specific synthesis module that conditioned the generator to retain better idiosyncratic gaze information. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of these modified approaches utilizing standard eye-tracking signal quality metrics, including spatial accuracy and precision. This work helps define synthetic signal quality, realism, and subject specificity, thereby contributing to the potential development of gaze-based applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09846v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the effectiveness of the real-time privacy-preserving techniques through an offline gaze-based interaction simulation framework. Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09813v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human content moderators (CMs) routinely review distressing digital content at scale. Beyond exposure, the work context (e.g., workload, team structure, and support) may shape mental health outcomes. We examined a cross sectional international CM sample (N = 166) and a U.S. prospective CM sample, including a comparison group of data labelers or tech support workers (N = 45) and gold standard diagnostic interviews. Predictors included workplace factors (e.g., hours per day distressing content, culture), cognitive-affective individual differences, and coping. Across samples, probable diagnoses based on validated clinical cutoffs were elevated (PTSD: 25.9 to 26.3%; depression: 42.1 to 48.5%; somatic symptoms: 68.7 to 89.5%; alcohol misuse: 10.5% to 18.3%). In the U.S. sample, CMs had higher interviewer rated PTSD severity (d = 1.50), likelihood of a current mood disorder (RR = 8.22), and lifetime major depressive disorder (RR = 2.15) compared to data labelers/tech-support workers. Negative automatic thoughts (b = .39 to .74), ongoing stress (b = .27 to .55), and avoidant coping (b = .30 to .34) consistently predicted higher PTSD and depression severity across samples and at 3 month followup. Poorer perceived workplace culture was associated with higher depression (b = -.16 to -.32). These findings strongly implicate organizational context and related individual response styles, not exposure dose alone in shaping risk. We highlight structural and technological interventions such as limits on daily exposure, supportive team culture, interface features to reduce intrusive memories, and training of cognitive restructuring and adaptive coping to support mental health. We also connect implications to adjacent human in the loop data work (e.g., AI red teaming), where similar risks are emerging.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09667v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs. To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.",

While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey \\textit{what} to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and \\textit{how} to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used \\textit{multimodal instruction} to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09612v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) has improved human decision-making across various domains by leveraging the complementary capabilities of humans and AI. Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.04802v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recordings of increasingly large neural populations have revealed that the firing of individual neurons is highly coordinated. When viewed in the space of all possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures called neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or during sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond to continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons. Classical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors can be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety of attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking network connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated. Here, we address this question by using group representation theory to formalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and the resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring model, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold. Interpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel with feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we then generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group representation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant RNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group Fourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a low-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the symmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results underline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a given symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different symmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle points.",

Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.10261v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.",

These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.",

      "content": "Background: Stroke induces profound neuroinflammation and systemic immune dysregulation, including disturbances in gut homeostasis. Experimental evidence suggests that intestinal barrier permeability (IBP) and bacterial translocation (BT) critically influence stroke outcomes. However, biological variability among commonly used rodent sub-strains has received limited attention. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared post-stroke immune responses in two Wistar rat sub-strains obtained from different suppliers: RccHan (Envigo) and RjHan (Janvier). Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, animals were assessed 72 hours later and stratified according to the presence or absence of BT. Immune cell populations in blood and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry, and leukocyte infiltration into ischemic brain tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Results: Both sub-strains developed significant infarcts and neurological deficits. RccHan rats displayed larger infarct volumes and more extensive BT across multiple organs. In contrast, RjHan rats exhibited BT mainly confined to mesenteric lymph nodes but showed greater IBP. Although dissemination was broader in RccHan rats, overall bacterial burden was slightly lower compared with RjHan, and extra-intestinal bacterial composition differed between groups. Notably, RjHan rats presented stronger systemic and central immune activation, with marked alterations in lymphocyte and monocyte populations and enhanced granulocyte and T cell infiltration within ischemic lesions. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that sub-strain origin profoundly influences post-stroke intestinal barrier integrity, bacterial dissemination, and immune responses. Considering sub-strain-related variability is essential to improve reproducibility and translational relevance in preclinical stroke research.",
