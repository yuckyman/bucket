      "title": "Circuit-specific gene editing for precision modulation of neuronal activity with CRISPR-rabies virus",
      "content": "CRISPR gene editing has revolutionized our ability to study and manipulate specific genes, enabling novel insights into gene function and potential therapies for brain disorders. Recent advances in cell-type-specific regulatory elements and viral delivery systems have made precise in vivo gene editing possible. However, neurons with similar molecular profiles can belong to different circuits, complicating efforts to manipulate circuit function and behavior. To address this, we developed CRISPR-rabies virus (CRV), which leverages the trans-synaptic spread of rabies virus to enable gene editing within anatomically defined neural circuits. By pairing CRV with cell type-specific Cas9 expression, we achieved targeted gene modifications in specific circuits. We demonstrate that CRV can modulate sodium and potassium channel expression in parvalbumin interneurons, thereby effectively regulating synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Its compatibility with 3'-capture single-cell RNA-seq allows simultaneous circuit perturbation and molecular profiling. In summary, CRV allows precise circuit-level gene modulation, providing a platform for studying gene function in neural circuits and developing novel gene therapies for brain disorders.",

      "title": "Neural oscillatory dynamics reveal altered top-down and integrative mechanisms during face processing in autistic children and unaffected siblings of autistic children",
      "content": "Face processing is fundamental to social communication and has been a major focus of autism research. While event-related potential (ERPs) studies of face processing have produced mixed results, little work has examined neuro-oscillatory dynamics, which may better capture the integrity of underlying networks. To address this gap, EEG was recorded from children aged 8-13 across three groups: autistic (n = 50), non-autistic (n = 38) and siblings of autistic children (n = 26), during a visual oddball task. In a blocked design, participants viewed faces and objects, presented upright and inverted (non-targets), to assess the face inversion effect (the FIE; a larger or earlier N170 to inverted than upright faces), and responded to infrequent shadow versions (targets). Analyses using permutation statistics and linear mixed models focused on non-target stimuli, quantifying face-related ERPs (P1, N170) and oscillatory activity associated with sensory and attentional processing (theta, alpha, gamma). Across groups, faces elicited earlier P1 and larger N170 amplitudes than objects, and showed a FIE. Furthermore, the rightward lateralization of the FIE was reduced for autistic participants. Analyses in the frequency domain revealed greater induced theta for inverted versus upright stimuli and for faces versus objects, revealing face specific effects, and stronger theta for inverted faces for the autistic and sibling groups, suggesting greater cognitive effort in processing these social stimuli. Gamma-band inter-trial phase coherence exhibited face selectivity only in the non-autistic group, pointing to differences in early network synchronization in autistic children relative to their non-autistic peers, whereas alpha event-related desynchronization did not vary by group or category. Altogether, these findings support altered neural synchronization/efficiency for autistic participants and siblings of autistic children, that is specific to face stimuli and seen despite largely typical sensory driven encoding. These data suggest that neural oscillatory assays are more sensitive to face processing differences in autism than broadband ERPs and that these oscillatory assays may be endophenotypic.",

      "title": "The hidden phase of memory: EEG signatures of reactivation during post-retrieval rest",
      "content": "Memory retrieval reactivates previously encoded representations, allowing for their modification and strengthening. However, the neural processes that follow reactivation and contribute to long-term retention remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the post-retrieval resting period to identify neural markers of memory reactivation and their relation to subsequent memory performance. Participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables in multisensory contexts and, on the following day, received either a cue-syllable reminder (context + cue syllable; RX) or a context-only reminder (RCTX) while EEG activity was recorded before and after the reminder presentation. Both reminders elicited significant reductions in beta power (25-40)Hz during the post-reminder rest, consistent with memory reactivation. The magnitude of beta decrement correlated with better long-term performance. Graph-theoretical analyses of phase synchronization networks in the beta band revealed that the RCTX reminder produced higher bilateral frontal betweenness centrality, suggesting greater engagement of frontal regions in mediating global information flow when retrieving only contextual cues. Moreover, frontal centrality and network density were predictive of subsequent memory accuracy. These findings demonstrate that memory reactivation extends beyond cue presentation into post-retrieval rest, leaving identifiable oscillatory and topological signatures that influence memory persistence. Our results underscore the crucial role of frontal network dynamics and beta-band activity in facilitating long-term memory.",

      "title": "Reactivating aversive memories in humans: An EEG and Microstates study of post-retrieval processes",
      "content": "Although fear conditioning is one of the most widely used models to study anxiety in humans, much remains to be explored regarding its underlying neural correlates. It is known that the retrieval of consolidated memories can trigger modifications, weakening, strengthening, or updating of the original memory, depending on the cues presented during the reminder. In this study, we employed a three-day threat-conditioning protocol in which an angry face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an aversive sound (unconditioned stimulus, US). Our main objective was to identify neural markers of post-retrieval processes triggered by the presentation of the CS+ alone, 24 hours after acquisition. Additionally, we aimed to assess cognitive biases by examining how the perception of the conditioned stimulus changes following conditioning. To this end, we recorded resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity using a 30-channel system at a 256 Hz sampling rate. We analyzed four minutes of resting-state EEG following the presentation of the reminder cue, focusing on memory-related patterns in the frequency domain and microstate dynamics. We compared neural activity after the reminder presentation between two groups: a Reactivation group previously exposed to threat conditioning on the first day and a Control group with no prior conditioning. Our results confirmed successful conditioning (CS+ US association) and memory retention 48 hours later, as evidenced by higher skin conductance responses and greater US expectancy to the CS+. Moreover, participants rated the CS+ face as more aversive than the CS-; face 48 hours after conditioning, compared to their pre-conditioning ratings. Relative to the Control group, the Reactivation group showed decreased beta-band activity (25-30 Hz) in central regions during the 90 seconds following the reminder, which may reflect enhanced post-reactivation processing of the memory, in contrast to participants who saw the face for the first time. Previous research has highlighted the role of reduced beta amplitude in the encoding and retrieval of another type of memory: episodic memory. Furthermore, when analyzing EEG microstates (short-lived, quasi-stable topographies of brain activity that reoccur over time), we found lower global field power for microstates C, A, E, and B in the Reactivation group compared with the Control group. Our findings provide initial evidence for neural correlates associated with post-retrieval processes, including decreased beta activity and microstate level differences related to the post-retrieval processing of an implicit memory.",

      "title": "Neural Encoding through Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation",
      "content": "Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form fc + {sum} ai fi). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (r {gtrsim} 2-3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ~2-3). HAM's log-uniform distribution yields a 1/f global spectral profile and 1/f sideband spectra in the broadband \"aperiodic\" component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network's intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.",
