      "title": "Studying the Effects of Robot Intervention on School Shooters in Virtual Reality",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17948v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17938v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17842v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired \"vibe\" (tone, style, or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment, reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and outline future directions and open research questions.",

Participants performed selection tasks comparing four visual configurations: a virtual controller, a virtual hand, both the controller and the hand, and neither representation. We found performance comparable between VR and MR, and switching between them did not impact the user's ability to perform basic tasks. Controller representations mimicking reality enhanced performance across both modes. However, users perceived performance differently in MR, indicating the need for unique MR design considerations, particularly regarding spatial awareness.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Game-based learning shows real promise for engaging students in well-funded schools, but what about everyone else? We propose a practical framework for implementing Minecraft Education Edition in Bangladesh's 130,000 schools where 55 percent lack reliable internet, rural areas experience 12-16 hour daily power availability, only 8 percent of rural schools have computer access, and student-teacher ratios reach 52:1. Our approach tackles these constraints head-on with three deployment tiers: cloud-based multiplayer for urban schools with stable infrastructure (15 percent), local area network solutions with solar power for semi-urban contexts (30 percent), and offline turn-based modes using refurbished hardware for rural settings (55 percent). We provide eight pre-built curriculum-aligned worlds with complete Bangla localization covering topics from Lalbagh Fort reconstruction to monsoon flood simulation. The interface accommodates first-time users through progressive complexity, culturally familiar metaphors using local farming and architecture, and accessibility features including keyboard-only controls and 200 percent text scaling. Teacher training spans 48 hours across digital literacy, pedagogical integration, and content creation. We detail evaluation protocols with specific benchmarks: 15 percent learning gains, 70 percent transfer task mastery, System Usability Scale scores above 70, and sub-two-dollar cost per student-hour. This framework has not been empirically validated; it synthesizes game-based learning theory, HCI principles, and contextual analysis to provide implementable specifications for pilot testing in resource-constrained settings.",

      "title": "Reimagining Disassembly Interfaces with Visualization: Combining Instruction Tracing and Control Flow with DisViz",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.18311v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In applications where efficiency is critical, developers may examine their compiled binaries, seeking to understand how the compiler transformed their source code and what performance implications that transformation may have. This analysis is challenging due to the vast number of disassembled binary instructions and the many-to-many mappings between them and the source code. These problems are exacerbated as source code size increases, giving the compiler more freedom to map and disperse binary instructions across the disassembly space. Interfaces for disassembly typically display instructions as an unstructured listing or sacrifice the order of execution. We design a new visual interface for disassembly code that combines execution order with control flow structure, enabling analysts to both trace through code and identify familiar aspects of the computation. Central to our approach is a novel layout of instructions grouped into basic blocks that displays a looping structure in an intuitive way. We add to this disassembly representation a unique block-based mini-map that leverages our layout and shows context across thousands of disassembly instructions. Finally, we embed our disassembly visualization in a web-based tool, DisViz, which adds dynamic linking with source code across the entire application. DizViz was developed in collaboration with program analysis experts following design study methodology and was validated through evaluation sessions with ten participants from four institutions. Participants successfully completed the evaluation tasks, hypothesized about compiler optimizations, and noted the utility of our new disassembly view. Our evaluation suggests that our new integrated view helps application developers in understanding and navigating disassembly code.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18296v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI (genAI) rapidly enters classrooms, accompanied by district-level policy rollouts and industry-led teacher trainings, it is important to rethink the canonical ``adopt and train'' playbook. Decades of educational technology research show that tools promising personalization and access often deepen inequities due to uneven resources, training, and institutional support. Against this backdrop, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 teachers from a large U.S. school district that was an early adopter of genAI. Our findings reveal the motivations driving adoption, the factors underlying resistance, and the boundaries teachers negotiate to align genAI use with their values. We further contribute by unpacking the sociotechnical dynamics -- including district policies, professional norms, and relational commitments -- that shape how teachers navigate the promises and risks of these tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18185v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose two novel interaction techniques for visualization-assisted exploration of urban data: Layer Toggling and Visibility-Preserving Lenses. Layer Toggling mitigates visual overload by organizing information into separate layers while enabling comparisons through controlled overlays. This technique supports focused analysis without losing spatial context and allows users to switch layers using a dedicated button. Visibility-Preserving Lenses adapt their size and transparency dynamically, enabling detailed inspection of dense spatial regions and temporal attributes. These techniques facilitate urban data exploration and improve prediction. Understanding complex phenomena related to crime, mobility, and residents' behavior is crucial for informed urban planning. Yet navigating such data often causes cognitive overload and visual clutter due to overlapping layers. We validate our visualization tool through a user study measuring performance, cognitive load, and interaction efficiency. Using real-world data from Sao Paulo, we demonstrate how our approach enhances exploratory and analytical tasks and provides guidelines for future interactive systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18158v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mental health assessments are of central importance to individuals' well-being. Conventional assessment methodologies predominantly depend on clinical interviews and standardised self-report questionnaires. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methodologies is frequently impeded by factors such as subjectivity, recall bias, and accessibility issues. Furthermore, concerns regarding bias and privacy may result in misreporting in data collected through self-reporting in mental health research. The present study examined the design opportunities and challenges inherent in the development of a mental health assessment tool based on natural language interaction with large language models (LLMs). An interactive prototype system was developed using conversational AI for non-invasive mental health assessment, and was evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 11 mental health professionals (six counsellors and five psychiatrists). The analysis identified key design considerations for future development, highlighting how AI-driven adaptive questioning could potentially enhance the reliability of self-reported data while identifying critical challenges, including privacy protection, algorithmic bias, and cross-cultural applicability. This study provides an empirical foundation for mental health technology innovation by demonstrating the potential and limitations of natural language interaction in mental health assessment.",

To answer this question, we randomly assigned participants (N = 470) to watch a short informational video presenting LLMs as either machines, tools, or companions -- or to watch no video. We then assessed how strongly they believed LLMs to possess various mental capacities, such as the ability have intentions or remember things. We found that participants who watched the companion video reported believing that LLMs more fully possessed these capacities than did participants in other groups. In a follow-up study (N = 604), we replicated these findings and found nuanced effects on how these videos impact people's reliance on LLM-generated responses when seeking out factual information. Together, these studies highlight the impact of messaging about AI -- beyond technical advances in AI -- to generate broad societal impact.",

      "title": "Driving factors of auditory category learning success",
      "content": "arXiv:2506.01508v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Our brain learns to update its mental model of the environment by abstracting sensory experiences for adaptation and survival. Learning to categorize sounds is one essential abstracting process for high-level human cognition, such as speech perception, but it is also challenging due to the variable nature of auditory signals and their dynamic contexts. To overcome these learning challenges and enhance learner performance, it is essential to identify the impact of learning-related factors in developing better training protocols. Here, we conducted an extensive meta-analysis of auditory category learning studies, including a total of 111 experiments and 4,521 participants, and examined to what extent three hidden factors (i.e., variability, intensity, and engagement) derived from 12 experimental variables contributed to learning success (i.e., effect sizes). Variables related to intensity and training variability outweigh others in predicting learning effect size. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of the neuroimaging studies revealed training-induced systematic changes in the frontotemporal-parietal networks. Increased brain activities in speech and motor-related auditory-frontotemporal regions and decreased activities in cuneus and precuneus areas are associated with increased learning effect sizes. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the driving forces behind speech and auditory category learning success, along with its neural changes, but also guide researchers and practitioners in designing more effective training protocols that consider the three key aspects of learning to facilitate learner success.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18808v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise. Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths. Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.",

While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.",

      "title": "Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17916v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17841v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to study human brain dynamics, yet its quantitative information capacity remains unclear. Here, we combine information theory and synthetic forward modeling to estimate the mutual information between latent cortical sources and EEG recordings. Using Gaussian-channel theory and empirical simulations, we find that scalp EEG conveys only tens of bits per sample about low-dimensional neural activity. Information saturates with approximately 64-128 electrodes and scales logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Linear decoders capture nearly all variance that is linearly recoverable, but the mutual information they recover remains far below the analytic channel capacity, indicating that measurement physics - not algorithmic complexity - is the dominant limitation. These results outline the intrinsic ceiling on how much structure about brain state or thought content can be inferred from EEG.",

      "title": "Decoding Dynamic Visual Experience from Calcium Imaging via Cell-Pattern-Aware SSL",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.18516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) holds a great deal of promise for applications in neuroscience, due to the lack of large-scale, consistently labeled neural datasets. However, most neural datasets contain heterogeneous populations that mix stable, predictable cells with highly stochastic, stimulus-contingent ones, which has made it hard to identify consistent activity patterns during SSL. As a result, self-supervised pretraining has yet to show clear signs of benefits from scale on neural data. Here, we present a novel approach to self-supervised pretraining, POYO-SSL that exploits the heterogeneity of neural data to improve pre-training and achieve benefits of scale. Specifically, in POYO-SSL we pretrain only on predictable (statistically regular) neurons-identified on the pretraining split via simple higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis)-then we fine-tune on the unpredictable population for downstream tasks. On the Allen Brain Observatory dataset, this strategy yields approximately 12-13% relative gains over from-scratch training and exhibits smooth, monotonic scaling with model size. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art baselines plateau or destabilize as model size increases. By making predictability an explicit metric for crafting the data diet, POYO-SSL turns heterogeneity from a liability into an asset, providing a robust, biologically grounded recipe for scalable neural decoding and a path toward foundation models of neural dynamics.",

      "title": "Dynamic threshold curves and response precision in forced excitable systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17837v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate here various properties of the responses of excitable systems subject to periodic forcing and noise. While the properties of intrinsic oscillators, subject to added periodic signals, are well understood, much less is known about the factors that determine the response precision of excitable units, intrinsically at rest, when activated by periodic forcing and stochastic noise. One motivation for considering this issue comes from the behavior of auditory neurons. These neurons reportedly have the ability to fire spikes in a precise range of phases in response to incoming sound waves, a behavior for which the mechanism is unknown. To account for such a response precision, we introduce the notion of dynamic threshold curve (DTC), which estimates at each time the effective likelihood that noise will subsequently generate a spike. The DTC effectively summarizes, in a single curve, a representation of the response precision of an excitable model, as we demonstrate by showing that the distribution of spike times produced in this setting is well captured by the first passage time of a simple, Gaussian stochastic process to the distance to the DTC. This result shows that peaks and troughs of the DTC, but also their slopes, convey fine information about spike timing in response to noise. In particular, it explains properties of Type 2 and Type 3 excitable cells studied previously and provides a framework to predict the DTC properties necessary to support the response precision of auditory neurons, as we illustrate in a well-established auditory neuron model.",

Recent years have seen a rise in studies of neural activations and model alignment. In this work, we review 25 fMRI-based studies published between 2023 and 2025 and explicitly confront their findings with two key hypotheses: (i) the Platonic Representation Hypothesis -- that as models scale and improve, they converge to a representation of the real world, and (ii) the Intermediate-Layer Advantage -- that intermediate (mid-depth) layers often encode richer, more generalizable features. Our findings provide converging evidence that models and brains may share abstract representational structures, supporting both hypotheses and motivating further research on brain-model alignment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.17822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in neural interfacing have enabled significant improvements in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular diagnostics. Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods. This framework paves the way for non-invasive, personalized neuromuscular assessments, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, prosthetic control, and neurorehabilitation.",

In this article I lay out what that \"standard model\" is and how it accounts for such a diversity of phenomena. The emergence of such a powerful standard model is unique in systems neuroscience, and I consider what conditions made it possible. The standard model now serves as a baseline from which to organize future retinal research, either by testing the model's assumptions directly, or by identifying phenomena that remain unexplained.",
