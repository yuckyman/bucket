      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

      "title": "Effects of 3DVR-haptic simulation training on cognitive functions: a functional neuroimaging pilot study using swLORETA qEEG",
      "content": "Introduction and aimTechnological advancements in neuroscience have transformed our understanding of the processes underlying behavior and cognition. The study aims to investigate the changes in functional brain cognitive networks activated by 3DVR haptic-based simulation training in endodontics.Materials and methodsFifteen dental students (7 females and 8 males), mean age 21.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fyears, trained for the first time with a 3DVR-haptic simulator in April 2025, participated in the study. The one-group pretest\u2013postest interventional design was approved by the Ethics Committee of MU\u2013Plovdiv. Before and after a one-hour VR-endodontic access practice, we measured connectivity changes in the 49 Brodmann fields using swLORETA qEEG. Data were standardized using an age-stratified normative base through Z-score calculations. The qEEG recordings were processed by Neuroguide 3.3.7 and statistically analyzed with Navistat, p\u202f<\u202f0.05. To control the cognitive effects the participants completed a classic neuropsychological test for assessing executive functions before and after VR training: the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A and Part B.ResultsThe most significant changes in brain activity were observed in the beta frequency range (18\u201324\u202fHz), primarily in the left frontal dorsolateral area, and the left insula and hippocampus. A significant change in activity was found in the mediobasal temporal cortex on both the left and right sides. According to connectomics, the most substantial changes were observed in the structures of 6, 7 and 8 ICN. The TMT data showed significant difference in records of the average time, difference and ratio scores before and after training in VR (p <\u202f0.05).Conclusion3DVR-haptic simulation training in endodontic actively engages cognitive modalities and brain structers related to executive functions, visuospatial sense, attention, and working memory, resilience to stress, and the need for reward. Objective electrophysiological changes correlate with improvements in neuropsychological performance TMT. Despite the limitations of this study, we argue that swLORETA qEEG method is a novel objective approach with a promising potential for validation the effects of 3DVR-haptic simulation training on cognitive functions, offering better temporal resolution compared to fMRI, along with lower costs and safety.",

      "title": "Beyond sex: the effects of testosterone on visuomotor performance in men and women",
      "content": "IntroductionThe ability to perform visually-guided motor tasks requires the transformation of visual information into programmed motor outputs. When the guiding visual information does not align spatially with the motor output, the brain processes rules to integrate somatosensory information into an appropriate motor response. Performance on such rule-based, \u201ccognitive-motor integration\u201d (CMI) tasks has been shown to be affected by sex, age, and in several neurologic conditions. The present study sought to (1) expand on these findings by examining whether such performance differences are related to levels of sex steroid hormones, and (2) characterize the relationship between hormone levels and any structural differences in brain regions responsible for complex motor control.MethodsThirty-six healthy individuals (18 females) underwent MRI scanning to acquire anatomical brain images. They performed two touchscreen-based eye\u2013hand coordination tasks, including a standard direct interaction task and one which involved CMI; target location and motor action were dissociated in the CMI task. Saliva samples collected on the day of testing were used to determine estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels.ResultsMultiple regression analyses revealed age to be a small but significant predictors of performance in a CMI condition with visual feedback reversal. We found that after accounting for this age effect, testosterone was a significant predictor of CMI performance in this group. We also observed that the relationship between testosterone levels and complex performance was related to grey matter thickness and volume in visuomotor control regions.ConclusionThese data suggest that underlying brain networks controlling simultaneous thought and action may differ as a function of sex steroid hormone concentrations, and that small performance declines emerge in the working-age years.",

      "title": "Domain-specific cognitive screening in acute first-ever stroke: a comparative study of the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) and ACE-III",
      "content": "IntroductionPost-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is common and often under-recognized, particularly in the acute phase. Most cognitive screening tools provide only a global score, overlooking domain-specific deficits that influence functional recovery. The Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a comprehensive cognitive test whose utility for acute stroke patients remains under-studied. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the ACE-III against the stroke-specific Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) in detecting PSCI following first-ever stroke in the acute period.MethodsPatients with first-ever stroke and no history of cognitive impairment were prospectively assessed within seven days of onset using both the OCS and ACE-III. PSCI was defined by impairment in one or more cognitive domains on the OCS. The discriminatory capacity of the ACE-III for detecting PSCI was examined, and associations between specific cognitive deficits and functional dependence were analyzed.ResultsThe OCS detected PSCI in 70% of the 30 patients that were recruited. The ACE-III demonstrated good discriminatory capacity (AUC = 0.897); however, it failed to detect PSCI in five patients identified by the OCS, and misclassified two aphasic but cognitively intact patients as impaired. Two patients classified as impaired on ACE-III were deemed cognitively intact by OCS, underscoring its limitations in stroke populations. Standard and stroke-specific ACE-III cut-offs demonstrated suboptimal accuracy for acute screening.ConclusionWhile ACE-III performs well at the group level, it may miss relevant cognitive impairment in the acute stroke setting. Domain-based, stroke-specific tools such as the OCS more reliably detect deficits and may offer greater clinical utility for early cognitive profiling and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Brain neural mechanisms underlying VR enhanced aerobic exercise for mood enhancement in depressed adolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionTo compare the immediate effects of a single bout of virtual reality (VR) aerobic exercise versus traditional aerobic exercise on depressive mood in middle-school students and to explore the underlying Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate and power-spectrum mechanisms.MethodsForty middle-school students were classified into depressed and healthy groups based on the PHQ-9 and completed 15 min of moderate-intensity conventional cycling and VR cycling in a crossover design. Mood was assessed with the Brief Mood Scale (BFS) before and after each intervention, and resting-state EEG was recorded. EEG signals were processed using power spectrum analysis and microstate analysis, and correlation analysis was conducted between BFS questionnaire scores and microstate parameters.ResultsBoth interventions significantly increased vigor and pleasure while reducing depression and lethargy (p < 0.001); VR was superior to traditional cycling in improving vigor, depression, and lethargy (p < 0.01). At baseline, the depressed group showed elevated occurrence and contribution of microstate C with abnormal centroids. After exercise, microstate distributions normalized in both groups; VR specifically reduced microstate C occurrence (p < 0.05), prolonged microstate D duration (p < 0.05), and enhanced B \u2192 C and D \u2192 B transitions (p < 0.05). Post-VR B \u2192 C transition rate correlated negatively with depression (r = \u22120.462), whereas microstate D occurrence correlated positively with pleasure (r = 0.450). Relative theta, alpha, and beta power decreased after exercise (p < 0.01), without additional VR-mediated power-spectrum gains.ConclusionA single bout of VR-assisted aerobic exercise more effectively enhances immediate mood in middle-school students with depressive symptoms than traditional cycling, likely owing to stronger modulation of microstate dynamics linked to emotion and attention networks and of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands.",

      "title": "Case Report: Prolonged DAWS in an RLS patient under severe relational stress",
      "content": "BackgroundDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) is a severe condition reported primarily in Parkinson's disease (PD) but increasingly recognized in restless legs syndrome (RLS). While DAWS is classically associated with high-dose dopamine agonists (DAs) in Parkinson's disease, it has also been reported in RLS patients treated with low-dose therapy (\u2264 0.75 mg pramipexole equivalent), although such cases remain rare. While direct evidence is lacking, psychological and relational stressors, in conjunction with prior medication adjustments, could plausibly modulate DAWS severity through a mechanism akin to kindling.Case presentationWe describe the case of a 51-year-old male who developed severe DAWS after withdrawing from low-dose pramipexole (0.26 mg) prescribed for RLS. A 6-month venlafaxine taper, completed 2 weeks before DA tapering, may have increased neurochemical vulnerability. Initial dose reduction caused akathisia, tremors, panic attacks, RLS worsening, and depressive symptoms. After brief reinstatement, abrupt cessation triggered painful electric-like sensations in the lower back and emotional collapse. The patient was transitioned to rotigotine (2 mg/day), together with other psychotropic medications, which provided partial and temporary relief. Symptoms relapsed during tapering, with marked worsening occurring in parallel with episodes of severe relational stress within a close personal connection. Clinical assessments explored these interactions as potential psychological stressors, as reported by the patient. Given the temporal association between these stressors and symptom relapses, relational factors may have contributed to the severity and recurrence of DAWS episodes. At 13 months after complete DA discontinuation, the patient has regained nearly full functionality, although episodes of marked fatigue and significant bedtime RLS persists.Discussion and conclusionThis case illustrates that DAWS can occur in RLS patients even at low DA doses, with atypical symptoms possibly involving autonomic and central sensitization. Relational stress may significantly exacerbate symptom severity, potentially leading to profound neurological destabilization through mechanisms such as cross-system hypersensitivity or a kindling-like process, as suggested by existing literature. This factor may need to be systematically assessed in DAWS management. As a rare patient-authored account, this report contributes to the understanding of DAWS in non-PD populations and highlights the need for longitudinal research to guide safer withdrawal protocols and integrated care.",

      "title": "The correlation between brain structure, function, and cognitive changes in patients with active-stage ulcerative colitis",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) frequently exhibit emotional disturbances and cognitive deficits. However, the neurobiological basis of these manifestations remains poorly understood. This study investigates neurostructural and functional alterations in UC patients using multimodal MRI to identify potential neural correlates.MethodsWe enrolled 45 active-stage UC patients and 48 healthy controls, all of whom underwent structural MRI, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), neurocognitive testing, and clinical assessments. Regional neural activity was evaluated using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), while gray matter volume (GMV) was analyzed to assess structural differences. Brain regions showing significant abnormalities were further examined for correlations with cognitive performance and clinical scale results.ResultsCompared to the healthy control group, the UC patient group exhibited higher scores in PSQI, PSS, SAS, and SDS. Furthermore, the UC patient group displayed varying degrees of impairment in attention, working memory, and executive function. The GMV of the bilateral thalamus in UC patients decreased, while the fALFF values in bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left lingual gyrus increased. Conversely, the fALFF values in multiple brain regions, including bilateral frontal lobes, the right temporal lobe, and the right inferior parietal lobule, were decreased. Multiple brain regions with reduced activity in the bilateral frontal lobes are closely related to emotions and executive control, while the increased activity in the bilateral PCG is strongly correlated with stress and anxiety. The reduction GMV in bilateral thalamic is associated with working memory and attention.ConclusionCognitive impairment and emotional abnormalities in UC are associated with the functional activity and structure of multiple brain regions, particularly in the bilateral frontal lobes, PCG and thalamus. These findings provide potential neuroimaging evidence for the activation of the gut-brain axis due to chronic inflammation, and that certain brain regions may be considered as key targets for predicting cognitive impairment for UC patients.",

      "content": "BackgroundDepression is a highly prevalent non-motor symptom in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) that can manifest several years prior to the clinical diagnosis of PD. The study was aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and related risk factors of depression in prodromal PD (pPD) subjects.MethodsA total of 47 pPD participants from community population of East China and 39 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the study. The pPD people were divided into two groups (pPD with depression and pPD without depression) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria. The severity of depression was assessed via the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24), and the clinical features of depression were assessed by calculating seven factors of the HAMD-24. Comparisons between the two pPD subgroups were conducted to evaluate the clinical characteristics of depression in the prodromal phase of PD. Risk factors for depression in prodromal PD were analyzed by multivariate Logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of depression in prodromal PD was 25.53%. pPD group with depression (dpPD) had significantly less years of education and higher HAMD overall scores, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores, PD non-motor questionnaire scores compared with pPD without depression (ndpPD). The dpPD group obtained significantly higher scores than the ndpPD group across several domains, including anxiety/somatization, cognitive impairment, day/night changes, retardation, and despair. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that anxiety was an independent risk factor for depression in pPD.ConclusionDepression is common in prodromal PD and exhibit a multifaceted nature. pPD subjects with depression are vulnerable to comorbid with other non-motor symptoms. Anxiety is an established risk factor for ndPD, which indicates the critical value of early mood management in early disease intervention.",

      "title": "LLM-based feature selection and counterfactual explanations applied to functional connectivity analysis in schizophrenia",
      "content": "IntroductionSchizophrenia (SZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder whose neural mechanisms are still unclear. Functional connectivity (FC) provides a unique perspective for understanding its pathology, but its high-dimensional nature poses significant challenges for feature selection and model interpretation. Traditional feature selection methods, while predictive, lack the integration of prior neuroscience knowledge, resulting in limited clinical relevance.MethodsTo address this, we propose an innovative framework that combines feature selection guided by a large language model (LLM) with counterfactual explanation. This framework leverages brain disease knowledge encoded by the LLM to guide dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional FC, ensuring that selected features are both statistically significant and biologically plausible. Counterfactual explanations are then used to generate causal intervention examples, which are then translated by the LLM into intuitive explanations in natural language, providing understandable and actionable clinical insights for individual patients or physicians.ResultsWe validate our approach on five real-world SZ datasets and demonstrate that it not only improves model classification performance but also provides new insights into SZ analysis.DiscussionThe LLM-based FC analysis method proposed in this study demonstrates good feature selection and interpretability on multiple SZ datasets. Its main advantage is its ability to effectively screen key FC features for brain regions. However, this method has some limitations, such as being difficult to directly apply clinically due to data heterogeneity, being unable to accurately locate individual FC abnormalities, and the hyperparameters for counterfactual generation not yet being optimized.",

Animals were randomly divided into Sham, MCAO/R, and Res groups. Neurological function was evaluated 24\u202fh after reperfusion. Cerebral infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The serum levels of M1/M2 polarization markers, including the enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase-1 (Arg-1), as well as the cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis (non-specific neuronal apoptosis) was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining method. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we focused on the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP-1 (Epac-1) and its downstream effector Ras-related protein 1 (Rap-1), which are known regulators of neuroinflammation. The expression levels of the exchange proteins directly activated by Epac-1 and Rap-1 in ischemic brain tissue were detected using Western blotting.ResultsRelative to the Sham group, the MCAO/R group exhibited significantly larger infarct volumes and higher neurological deficit scores, together with increased serum iNOS and IL-12 and decreased IL-10 and Arg-1 (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The apoptosis of neuronal cells increases while the expressions of Epac-1 and Rap-1 proteins decrease (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Res treatment significantly reduced infarct size and neurological deficits; lowered serum iNOS and IL-12; raised IL-10 and Arg-1; and improved Epac-1 and Rap-1 expression compared with the MCAO/R group (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionRes exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, potentially by modulating microglial polarization toward the M2 phenotype via the Epac-1/Rap-1 signaling pathway, thereby suppressing inflammation and mitigating neuronal damage.",

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) were used to assess VBM grey matter volume (GMV) and FC. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). CSF pressure, protein levels, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) were measured. Statistical analyses included group comparisons and multivariable regression adjusted for age, gender, and hypertension.ResultsHSE patients exhibited significant GMV reductions in the right hippocampal gyrus, left precuneus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Enhanced FC was observed between the left hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while weakened connectivity was noted between the left precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and mPFC in controls. Cognitive scores (MoCA) were lower in HSE patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and positively correlated with GMV and FC metrics (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Elevated CSF pressure, protein, and proinflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-6) were negatively associated with cerebral metrics (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A significant interaction between IL-6 and cerebral metrics further influenced cognitive outcomes (p\u2009<\u20090.05).ConclusionHSE is associated with distinct microstructural and functional connectivity changes that are correlated with cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest a potential interaction between IL-6 levels, cerebral alterations, and cognitive dysfunction, which may inform the exploration of neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers in personalized therapeutic strategies. However, these represent observational associations, and further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and establish causal relationships.",

      "title": "Ferroptosis in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: molecular mechanisms and advances in therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by the continuous decline of cognitive functions. Its pathogenesis involves complex, multidimensional interactions among various molecular pathways. In recent years, ferroptosis, a regulated form of iron-dependent cell death, has emerged as a crucial contributor to AD progression. Ferroptosis is defined by the accumulation of lipid peroxides and inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and is typically initiated in the context of disrupted iron homeostasis, aberrant lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. This review comprehensively delineates the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated iron metabolism in AD and proposes an integrative \u201ciron\u2013lipid\u2013energy\u2013inflammation\u201d axis as a pathological framework. Particular attention is given to the GPX4 signaling pathway as a central hub linking lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and immune responses. Moreover, ferroptosis can propagate through intercellular mechanisms involving the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), dysregulation of immune checkpoints, and exosome-mediated signaling, collectively driving microglial activation, T-cell infiltration, and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, culminating in systemic immune imbalance. We further evaluate multiple therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis, including iron chelators, antioxidants, GPX4 activators, and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Based on emerging evidence, we propose a precision medicine approach that incorporates ferroptosis subtyping, multi-omics analysis, and targeted delivery systems. Ferroptosis represents a promising frontier for early diagnosis and intervention in AD, potentially enabling the development of causality-oriented, mechanism-based therapies.",

      "title": "Optimal interphase delay in biphasic current pulses facilitates neural circuit activation induced by microstimulation in the mouse visual cortex",
      "content": "Cathodic-first biphasic current pulses are commonly employed in intracortical microstimulation. Due to the intricate arrangement of axons, somata, and dendrites in the cerebral cortex, membrane polarizations induced by the cathodic and subsequent anodic phases of biphasic pulses may interact in a location-, magnitude-, and timing-dependent manner. Introducing an interphase delay between the two phases has been proposed to mitigate counteracting interactions between these membrane polarizations. Previous clinical studies on visual prostheses have demonstrated that such a delay lowers the stimulus threshold required for percept induction. However, despite this functional outcome, direct physiological observations of cathodic\u2013anodic interactions in cortical circuit activation remain limited. Here, we employed voltage-sensitive dye imaging in mouse brain slices to visualize membrane excitation elicited by biphasic current pulses with varying interphase delays. The results demonstrated that an optimal interphase delay nonlinearly facilitated cortical circuit activation in response to both single and repetitive pulses. At 10 \u03bcA/phase and 200 \u03bcs/phase, the biphasic pulse elicited larger excitation with a 500\u2013600-\u03bcs interphase delay than with shorter or longer delays or the cathodic monophasic pulse. At 20 \u03bcA/phase, the cathodic monophasic pulse and biphasic pulses with interphase delays > 800 \u03bcs elicited larger excitation than all other conditions. Pharmacological experiments suggested that trans-synaptic excitation contributes to this facilitative effect. These findings provide evidence that an optimally timed cathodic\u2013anodic interaction enhances cortical circuit activation, beyond simply negating opposing phase effects. Such timing optimization of stimulus pulses may improve neural recruitment efficiency while minimizing charge delivery, offering insights for intracortical prosthetic design.",

      "content": "IntroductionWhite matter tract segmentation is critical for mapping brain connectivity in both clinical and research settings. Recent deep learning methods have enabled direct voxel-wise segmentation from diffusion MRI (dMRI), bypassing tractography. However, most approaches rely on a limited number of peaks extracted from the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) at each voxel, which discards important orientation information, particularly in problematic regions with complex fiber configurations such as crossing fibers and bottlenecks.MethodsIn this work, we introduce FODSeg, a voxel-based segmentation method that utilizes the complete fODF representation for each voxel, capturing the full angular structure of white matter orientation. Additionally, we reformulate tract segmentation as a singleclass problem, training one model per tract to reduce label conflicts inherent in multi-class approaches. This combination allows FODSeg to better distinguish tracts with similar local orientations and improves robustness in regions with structural ambiguity. We evaluate FODSeg on the Human Connectome Project dataset across all 72 white matter tracts using six segmentation accuracy metrics.ResultsFODSeg achieves higher Dice scores and lower volumetric overreach values in 70% of the tracts while maintaining high specificity. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of FODSeg over existing segmentation approaches. Notably, our method shows significant improvements in anatomically challenging bottleneck regions, reducing false positives and improving tract-specific precision.DiscussionOverall, FODSeg advances white matter tract segmentation by leveraging the full richness of the fODF signal while improving accuracy, specificity, and anatomical consistency.",

      "title": "Neural basis of intensity-dependent brain activity in response to mechanical stimulation and the level of pain sensitivity",
      "content": "IntroductionPain perception greatly varies among individuals and represents a major clinical challenge. Current pain assessment relies on subjective reports; although straightforward, these cannot distinguish the diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of pain. Elucidating brain functional mechanisms using fMRI is crucial for realizing more objective pain assessment. Most studies have focused on thermal stimuli or psychological evaluations, and no studies have focused on differences in sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify regional differences in brain activation during mechanical stimulation at different intensities using fMRI and to clarify brain activation patterns associated with differences in pain sensitivity between the low- and high-threshold groups.MethodsWe enrolled 52 healthy adults. After measuring mechanical tactile and pain thresholds, fMRI was performed during mechanical stimulation at three intensities (60, 100, and 180\u202fg). Regions of brain activation were identified for each stimulus intensity in all participants and for the high- and low-threshold groups, using the 100-g stimulus as the cutoff value, based on mechanical pain thresholds.ResultsNotable results regarding the change in stimulus intensity are that significant activation was observed in the anterior insular cortex at 60\u202fg; anterior insular cortex, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum at 100\u202fg; and cerebellum, angular gyrus, and thalamus at 180\u202fg of stimulus intensity. Notable results regarding the level of pain sensitivity are that, when classified into the low- (n\u202f=\u202f24) and high-threshold (n\u202f=\u202f28) groups, activation in the low-threshold group was limited to the somatosensory cortex and its related regions. However, the high-threshold group exhibited activation in the anterior insular cortex, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, in addition to the somatosensory cortex.ConclusionThe expansion of brain activation with increasing stimulus intensity suggests the involvement of higher-order central processing, such as attention and response preparation, in noxious stimulus processing. Additionally, differences in pain thresholds may reflect variations in the mode of neural response; the high-threshold group exhibited activation in the frontoparietal network, associated with cognitive control. These findings provide a neurobiological basis for psychological interventions and may serve as a foundation for developing objective biomarkers and advancing personalized pain treatment strategies.",

      "content": "IntroductionPoor sleep quality affects 50\u201363% of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, exacerbating disease burden and reducing quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among disease severity, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality in ALS, with a focus on the mediating effects of depression.MethodsOur study enrolled 408 ALS patients. Disease severity was assessed using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), sleep quality via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and psychological status using the Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) scales. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlations, multivariate regression, and mediation analysis (Hayes\u2019 PROCESS macro).ResultsPoor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) was observed in 54.4% of patients. Multivariate analysis found ALSFRS-R (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.135, p\u202f=\u202f0.042) and HAMD (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.270, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) correlated with sleep quality. Initial mediation analysis using the full ALSFRS-R and PSQI scales was not significant. Aimed to further explore the correlation, we derived specific subscales ALSFRS-R\u2019 (motor/respiratory components) and PSQI\u2019 (sleep efficiency/ daytime dysfunction), which more correlated with each other. Mediation analysis of these subscales revealed that depressive symptoms accounted for 36.3% of the indirect effect between ALSFRS-R\u2019 and PSQI\u2019.DiscussionOur cross-sectional exploratory study suggests that depression may partly mediate the relationship between motor dysfunction and poor sleep quality in patients with ALS. Although our mediation analysis suggested a potential association, further longitudinal cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings. The potential mediating role of depression underscores the need for an integrated clinical management approach addressing not only motor symptoms but psychological well-being as well.",
