      "title": "Distributed activity in the human posterior putamen distinguishes goal-directed from habitual control in humans",
      "content": "There is considerable variability across individuals in the behavioral expression of goal-directed and habitual control, and yet little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomical basis of such differences. Here, we aimed to determine whether distinct patterns of brain activity during initial learning of instrumental actions can indicate whether an individual subsequently utilizes a goal-directed or habitual behavioral strategy. We applied multivariate pattern analyses to a large fMRI dataset composed of 108 participants performing an instrumental action-learning task. Region-of-interest (ROI) and whole-brain searchlight analyses with cross-validation indicate that distributed activation patterns in the left posterior putamen during training distinguish goal-directed from habitual participants, ascertained via subsequent administration of an outcome devaluation test. This finding was further replicated and generalized to two fully held-out samples: an additional cohort of healthy participants (n = 38) and a separate group of psychiatric patients with variable diagnoses (n = 55). These findings reveal that it is possible to predict an individual's overall behavioral strategy from circumscribed activity in the human brain, while specifically implicating the posterior putamen in the implementation of distinct behavioral control strategies.",

      "title": "Susceptibility to Task-irrelevant Auditory Distractors in Relation to Visual Working Memory in Children With and Without ADHD",
      "content": "Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children and is often associated with increased distractibility. Previous research has reported that susceptibility to task-irrelevant visual distractions is associated with visual working memory (WM) capacity. However, how neural responses to task-irrelevant auditory distractors are related to visual WM capacity in children with and without ADHD remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 72 children with ADHD and 88 typically developing (TD) children across two experiments, during which they performed visual tasks of varying difficulty while task-irrelevant auditory distractors were presented. The mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude was measured as a neural index of susceptibility to auditory distractors, and the K score was assessed as a behavioral indicator of visual WM capacity. Results: TD children showed opposite patterns across the two experiments: under low audiovisual competition, those with higher visual working memory capacity were more susceptible to task-irrelevant sounds, whereas under high competition, children with lower capacity showed greater susceptibility to distraction. In contrast, children with ADHD showed a stable association, with lower visual WM capacity consistently predicting higher susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distractors regardless of competition level. Conclusions: These findings provide novel evidence that susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distraction is closely related to visual WM capacity in both children with and without ADHD, but the patterns of this relationship differ between typical and atypical neurodevelopment and are modulated by audiovisual competition.",

      "title": "Environmental dynamics shape human learning: change points versus random walks",
      "content": "Adaptive learning requires interpreting prediction errors in light of environmental dynamics. However, environments may not only differ in terms of when changes occur, but also how they occur: some nonstationary processes in nature exhibit slow drifts over time, while others show more abrupt changes. This raises the question as to whether humans can adapt their learning to reflect the generative structure of their environment. Here, we compared how humans learn in two canonical nonstationary environments: abrupt change points versus gradual random walks. Using a predictive inference task and a unified Bayesian framework, we show across two behavioral experiments that humans adapt their learning normatively between these two environments. Notably, identical prediction errors were interpreted differently across them. Large prediction errors triggered sharp increases in learning rate under change-point but not random-walk dynamics, where small and large errors were more equally weighted. This matched the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, which itself adopted the appropriate generative model for each environment. In addition, we found that humans could dissociate two latent variables that needed to be jointly inferred: the mean and variance (or stochasticity). This was demonstrated by explicit uncertainty reports that closely tracked the current variance, and only showed sustained changes following change points in variance but not mean. Together, these results show that humans adapt their learning strategy to both how and what aspects of the environment are changing. They establish a unified computational account of adaptive learning across different environmental dynamics.",

      "title": "Regional brain age deviations reveal divergent developmental pathways in youth",
      "content": "Background. Normative modeling of brain development has gained traction for quantifying individual deviations in maturation. The brain age gap (BAG), the difference between predicted age from MRI features and chronological age, offers a potential individualized normative metric of neurodevelopment. However, consistent patterns across psychiatric disorders remain elusive, and no studies have examined whether BAG can predict developmental trajectories within an inclusive continuous model of youth cognition and behavior. Methods. Using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ages 9-15, n=9,074), we built 8 region-specific brain age models using volumes, thicknesses, and surface areas of parcels from the Brainnetome adolescent atlas. We derived psychiatric diagnoses from a parental questionnaire. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess case-control differences and cross-sectional continuous cognitive/behavioral profiles. We modeled cognitive/behavioral trajectories using a multivariate joint latent-class mixed model and assessed the relationship with BAG values using multinomial logistic regression. Results. Children with ADHD showed delayed maturation across multiple regions (Cohen d: -0.12 to -0.08), while subcortical BAG emerged as a transdiagnostic indicator of delayed development (d: -0.07, pfdr = 0.024). Accelerated maturation characterized the high cognition and low symptom profile, while the inverse was found for the low cognition profile. Three developmental trajectories were identified: stable, towards externalizing behaviors, or internalizing behaviors. Widespread accelerated maturation predicted evolution towards internalizing behaviors but was protective against the externalizing trajectory. Conclusions. Integrating BAG with continuous cognitive and behavioral profiles yielded a plausible framework for early identification of atypical trajectories, potentially contributing to personalized medicine in psychiatry.",

      "title": "NDNF+ interneurons have a privileged role in regulating cortical excitability",
      "content": "Cortical processing depends critically on the precise modulation of excitatory activity by a diverse population of GABAergic interneurons. Among these, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor-expressing (NDNF+) interneurons have been proposed to be \"master regulators\" of cortical microcircuits. While their role in coordinating physiological cortical activity is beginning to be understood, their contribution to restraining hyperexcitability during epileptiform activity remains unexplored. To address this, we employed calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in an NDNF-Cre mouse line to investigate how NDNF+ interneurons influence cortical hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures. Our results demonstrate that NDNF+ interneurons are actively recruited during interictal spikes and focal seizures, although more slowly than parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Optogenetic hyperpolarization of NDNF+ interneurons exacerbates epileptic discharges, whereas their depolarization suppresses focal seizures, even when the optogenetic stimulus is delayed by several seconds from seizure onset. This effect is largely mediated by GABAB receptor signalling. Additionally, chemogenetic depolarization of NDNF+ interneurons has robust antiepileptic effects both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish NDNF+ neurons as key regulators of cortical excitability and identify them as promising cellular targets for the development of anti-epileptic therapies.",

      "content": "ObjectivesThe \u201cMOC strategy\u201d is a binaural audio processing method for cochlear implants (CI) inspired by the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. Although the strategy can improve hearing for CI users, it requires a bilateral channel pairing for the contralateral control of the backend compression and, therefore, the same number of frequency channels and electrodes on both sides. This may limit its clinical applicability. As a step to overcome this difficulty, here, we present and test a version of the MOC strategy designed to operate at the front end (FE) rather than the back end of processing, referred to as the MOCFE.DesignThe MOCFE strategy was implemented and tested in combination with a pair of functionally independent bilateral MED-EL FS4 audio processors. The hearing of bilateral CI users was compared for the MOCFE as well as for two reference strategies: the standard FS4 strategy and a backend MOC strategy. The MOCFE and MOC strategies were implemented with fast contralateral inhibition. Measures included (1) speech reception thresholds for sentences in fluctuating and stationary noise, in unilateral and bilateral listening modes, and for three different speech levels; and (2) sound source localization in quiet and in noise. Five bilateral users of MED-EL CIs participated in the evaluations.Results(1) For speech intelligibility in fluctuating noise, the MOCFE was as beneficial (re FS4) as the backend MOC strategy, except for one specific spatial configuration (S\u221260N60), where the MOCFE produced no benefits while the MOC strategy did. (2) Neither the MOCFE nor the MOC strategies improved intelligibility in a stationary noise, possibly because they involved fast rather than slow contralateral inhibition. (3) The binaural MOCFE and MOC strategies tended to improve sound source localization slightly relative to the FS4 strategy.ConclusionThe MOCFE can become a successful alternative to the MOC strategy, as it may be more easily implemented in clinical devices and applied to a broader range of clinical map configurations.",

Analyzing this computationally is hard because:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Orthography vs. Phonetics:</strong> What is written isn't what is pronounced (e.g., &quot;Allahu&quot; has a hidden long vowel).</li> <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> A single meter like <em>Kamil</em> has dozens of valid variations (<em>Zihaf</em>) where letters can be dropped or quieted.</li> <li><strong>LLMs struggle:</strong> Asking ChatGPT to scan a poem usually results in hallucinations because it predicts tokens rather than strictly following the prosodic rules.</li> </ol> <p><strong>The Solution: PyArud</strong></p> <p>I built a deterministic engine that:</p> <p>* <strong>Converts Text:</strong> Uses regex and lookaheads to handle deep phonetic rules (like <em>Iltiqa al-Sakinayn</em> - the meeting of two stills).</p> <p>* <strong>Greedy Matching:</strong> Implements a greedy algorithm to segment verses into their component feet (<em>Tafilas</em>).</p> <p>* <strong>Deep Analysis:</strong> Identifies not just the meter, but the specific defect (<em>Ellah</em>) used in every foot.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <pre><code>from pyarud.processor import ArudhProcessor # A verse from Al-Mutanabbi verse = [(&quot;\u0623\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u064f\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0652\u062f\u0627\u062b\u064e \u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u0630\u064e\u0645\u0651\u0627&quot;, &quot;\u0641\u064e\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0634\u064f\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0644\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0651\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u0627&quot;)] processor = ArudhProcessor() result = processor.process_poem(verse) print(f&quot;Meter: {result['meter']}&quot;) # Output: 'taweel' print(f&quot;Score: {result['verses'][0]['score']}&quot;) # Output: 1.0 </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> Developers building apps for arabic poetry</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong><br /> No alternative solutions exist for this problem</p> <p><strong>What's new in v0.1.3?</strong></p> <p>* <strong>Robustness:</strong> Improved handling of &quot;Solar Lam&quot; and implicit vowels.</p> <p><strong>* Architecture:</strong> A modular pipeline separating linguistic normalization from mathematical pattern matching.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p><strong>* Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/cnemri/pyarud\"><strong>https://github.com/cnemri/pyarud</strong></a></p> <p><strong>* Docs:</strong> <a href=\"https://cnemri.github.io/pyarud\"><strong>https://cnemri.github.io/pyarud</strong></a></p> <p><strong>* PyPI: `pip install pyarud`</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chou404\"> /u/chou404 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8t4a8/i_built_a_deterministic_engine_to_analyze/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8t4a8/i_built_a_deterministic_engine_to_analyze/\">[comments]</a></span>",
