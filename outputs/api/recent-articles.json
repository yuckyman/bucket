      "title": "TRPM2 is a direct pain transducer",
      "content": "Chronic pain results from maladaptive interaction between the immune and nervous systems. TRPM2 channels in immune cells (immune TRPM2) are believed to facilitate chronic pain by indirectly promoting immune-inflammatory responses. Whereas TRPM2 in sensory neurons (neuronal TRPM2) acts as a warmth sensor critical to sense innocuous warm temperatures. However, neuronal TRPM2 mediates the warmth sensitivity of less than 3.5% of sensory neurons. The functions of the vast majority (42%) of TRPM2+ neurons are unknown. Here we show that neuronal TRPM2 functions as a pain sensor responsible for directly transducing acute and chronic pain independently of immune TRPM2. Both chronic arthritis pain and neuropathic pain were markedly reduced in TRPM2-knockout mice, and the pain deficit was recapitulated by sole deletion of neuronal TRPM2. However, immune and inflammatory responses were largely similar between wild-type and neuronal TRPM2-deficient mice. Moreover, antagonizing joint TRPM2 rapidly reversed chronic arthritis pain without affecting joint inflammation. Mechanistically, TRPM2 is activated by PGE2 and IgG immune complex (IgG-IC) through GalphaoA and FcgRI coupling, respectively, independently of conventional signalling messengers. Consistently, acute pain induced by PGE2 and IgG-IC was abolished in TRPM2 mutant mice. We conclude that neuronal TRPM2 is a convergent direct pain transducer independently of inflammation, representing an appealing target for alleviating chronic pain.",

      "title": "Clinical profile impacts the replicability of multivariate brain-behavioural associations",
      "content": "Recent work suggests that thousands of individuals are required in multivariate brain-behaviour analyses to obtain consistently replicable results. Some believe, however, that smaller sample sizes may be sufficient if specific subpopulations are targeted. We investigated how sample size and cohort composition influence the replicability of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) results using the UK Biobank (N=40,514). We applied CCA to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) phenotypes and cognitive assessment test scores. We defined four participant cohorts based on clinical profile and found that, across all cohorts, sample sizes of around 500 were needed to obtain replicable canonical correlations and variable loadings. The most targeted cohort required much fewer samples to achieve similar or greater correlations than the other cohorts. Variable loadings were consistent between sample sizes of ~500 to thousands, suggesting that sample sizes in the order of hundreds may be sufficient for obtaining reliable CCA results.",

      "title": "NPS neurons receive extensive input from auditory brainstem nuclei",
      "content": "Neurons that produce NPS send output to brain regions implicated in circadian function and threat responses, but less is known about the afferent control of NPS neurons. In this study, we used a conventional retrograde tracer, cholera toxin beta subunit (CTb), to identify afferents to the rostral-lateral parabrachial region that contains the main concentration of NPS neurons. We then used Cre-dependent rabies retrograde tracing in Nps-2A-Cre mice to identify inputs specifically to NPS neurons. Nps-expressing neurons receive heavy input from auditory brainstem structures, including the inferior colliculus, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, superior olivary complex, and cochlear nucleus. These findings suggest an unexpected role for auditory information in controlling the activity of NPS neurons.",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",
