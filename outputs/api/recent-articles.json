The model classifies each process as \u201cCritical\u201d or \u201cBloatware\u201d. For bloatware it prints a short roast and offers to kill it. BrainKernel (<a href=\"https://github.com/mprajyothreddy/brainkernel\">https://github.com/mprajyothreddy/brainkernel</a>) replaces the usual CPU % sorting with \u201cvibe\u2011based\u201d sorting, shows a live\u2011updating table while staying under 1 % CPU, and can auto\u2011suspend distraction apps (e.g., Steam, games) when they exceed a user\u2011defined threshold. </p> <p>**Target Audience** </p> <p>- Developers who are tired of manually hunting down unknown processes. </p> <p>- Linux and Windows users who want a task manager that explains what a process is doing. </p> <p>- Anyone experimenting with local edge AI integrated into the OS loop. </p> <p>**Comparison** </p> <p>- **vs htop/top:** htop is faster and lighter but assumes you know every process name. BrainKernel adds semantic classification, giving meaning to each PID. </p> <p>- **vs Windows Task Manager:** Windows\u2019 manager is GUI\u2011centric and lacks process explanations. BrainKernel is keyboard\u2011centric, can \u201croast\u201d bloatware for entertainment, and includes a focus/governor mode that can automatically suspend or kill distracting applications.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Turbulent-Spark6633\"> /u/Turbulent-Spark6633 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3oxk3/i_built_a_tui_process_manager_that_uses_a_local/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3oxk3/i_built_a_tui_process_manager_that_uses_a_local/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Snipers under stress: mentally simulated motor actions are resistant to acute stress in police officers",
      "content": "Motor imagery (MI) is a sensorimotor process allowing to mentally simulate a motor action and is widely used to enhance performance in domains such as rehabilitation, sport, and professional training. Although MI is increasingly incorporated into stress-management interventions, the reciprocal relationship, that is, the effect of acute stress on MI remain paradoxically poorly understood, particularly in ecologically valid settings. The present study investigated this issue in professional police officers performing physically and mentally a precise handgun manipulation task under graded stress conditions (psychological stress). Fourteen participants was exposed to controlled, work-related stress scenarios designed to closely reflect real operational demands, while stress markers and temporal features of executed and imagined movements were recorded. Our results clearly indicate that motor imagery was preserved despite significant increases in stress levels, as the temporal characteristics of both executed and imagined movements remained stable across experimental conditions. These findings indicate that MI is resilient to acute psychosocial stress and support its relevance as a reliable training and performance-optimization tool in high-demand occupational settings.",

      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",
