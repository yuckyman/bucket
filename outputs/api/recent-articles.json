      "title": "Dynamic graph neural networks for UAV-based group activity recognition in structured team sports",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we validated our model by testing amblyopic participants and demonstrating that the amblyopic visual system exhibits a larger High-phi transition point, thereby characterizing slower temporal integration. Overall, our results show that the integration of visual motion energy could switch adaptation from priming to aftereffect.",

      "content": "Histopathological image classification (HIC) plays a pivotal role in computer-aided diagnosis, enabling lesion characterization (e.g., tumor grading) and survival outcome prediction. Despite recent advances in HIC, existing methods still face challenges in integrating domain-specific knowledge, addressing class imbalance, and ensuring computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose AMLPF-CLIP, an enhanced CLIP-based framework for HIC featuring three key innovations. First, we...",

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel model, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the...",

This study aimed to identify suitable gymnastics elements for the execution with a head-mounted display (HMD), considering potential performance impacts related to its size, weight, and limited field of view. Twelve basic elements covering the characteristics of the balance beam were...",
