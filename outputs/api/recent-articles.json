      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study used a linear mixed model to explore the relationship between cognitive function and depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients.ParticipantsThe study data were collected from 450 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients who participated in the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Progress Marker Project (PPMI) from 2010 to 2024, including 176 women and 274 men.MeasurementsCognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (Moca), and depression was measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The correlation between cognitive function and depression was determined using a linear mixed model.ResultsAnxiety, daily living ability, and autonomic nervous system function are significant factors affecting both men and women. Women experience a stronger impact of anxiety, daily activity limitations, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction on depression. The longer the duration of the illness, the more severe the depression in women. Moreover, cognitive abilities protect against depression only in women. Women exhibit higher individual heterogeneity in baseline depression and greater variability in the rate of change over time, with those who are more depressed showing a more gradual change.ConclusionIn female Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, there is a negative correlation between cognitive ability and depression, whereas this correlation is not observed in male patients. This study provides new evidence that sex differences influence the relationship between cognitive ability and depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. Future research should consider the role of sex differences in the context of cognitive ability and depression.",

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
      "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

      "content": "Growing evidence highlights a tight interplay linking circadian and sleep\u2013wake disturbances to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. In \u03b1-synucleinopathies, three key points have emerged: (1) circadian and sleep\u2013wake disruptions may increase the risk of neurodegeneration; (2) these alterations reflect widespread dysfunction in neural circuits regulating sleep, wakefulness, and biological rhythms; and (3) the prodromal condition of isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) offers a unique window into early pathological changes, as it is characterized by neurodegeneration in brainstem structures critical for sleep\u2013wake regulation and REM sleep control. Hence, sleep- and circadian-related biomarkers may represent feasible tools for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment across the spectrum of \u03b1-synucleinopathies. However, despite their potential, diagnostic or therapeutic pathways grounded in sleep and circadian biology have yet to be systematically explored or validated, and key questions remain, including the trajectories that characterize the clinical progression from iRBD to overt \u03b1-synucleinopathies. Key challenges include translational barriers, inter-individual variability in biomarker profiles, and the need for longitudinal studies to define clinically actionable thresholds. Against this backdrop, this mini-review synthesizes current evidence on sleep\u2013wake rhythm alterations in iRBD as a prodromal stage of \u03b1-synucleinopathy-driven neurodegeneration. Candidate circadian biomarkers are discussed, including objective parameters from long-term actigraphic monitoring, encompassing rest\u2013activity rhythms modeled with parametric and non-parametric approaches, as well as physiological indicators such as dim light melatonin onset and core body temperature.",

      "title": "Noninvasive MGMT-promotor methylation prediction in high grade gliomas using conventional MRI and deep learning-based segmentations",
      "content": "Background/objectivesHigh grade gliomas (HGG) are aggressive brain tumors, most frequently glioblastoma and astrocytoma grade 4. Methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in HGG is crucial for temozolomide efficacy. As MGMT promoter methylation (MGMTpm) assessment requires tumor tissue, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of interest for non-invasive prediction. We aimed to analyze volumetric data from edema, contrast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, total-tumor and total-tumor/edema ratio for MGMTpm prediction in HGG. Further we assessed overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) between groups and volumes.MethodsSegmentation was performed using deep learning models (DL-models), DeepBraTumIA and Raidionics, on 70 HGG patients (45 males, 32 MGMTpm). Manual segmentation was conducted in 37 for validation of DL-models. Group differences were evaluated using Man-Whitney U tests and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves. Multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression and bootstrapping. Dice coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test evaluated DL-model performance.ResultsMGMTpm tumors displayed significantly larger edema, segmented by DeepBraTumIA (p\u202f=\u202f0.03), and lower total-tumor/edema ratio segmented by both DL-models (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Raidionics segmented total-tumor/edema ratio showed highest univariate predictive ability with area under curve 0.687 (sensitivity 46.2%, specificity 87.5%). Multivariate analysis confirmed this, showing that the ratios from both DL-models were the only ROIs to remain independent, significant predictors (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) after controlling for clinical covariates. The overall multivariate models were significant (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) and improved prediction over baseline. ICC showed interclass correlation of 0.96 (contrast-enhancing tumor), 0.50 (tumor necrosis) and 0.90 (peritumoral edema). Segmentation methods demonstrated 83\u201391% median overlap in contrast-enhancing tumor, 67\u201380% in necrosis and 80\u201384% in edema regions. Significant OS and PFS differences were observed, notably being longer in MGMTpm tumors and lower tumor volumes.ConclusionThis study suggests that significant radiological differences in MGMTpm can be found using deep learning models, primarily in tumor edema volume. MGMTpm status and region of interest volumes impact OS and PFS. Future studies should incorporate other molecular imaging sequences for methylation prediction.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.
