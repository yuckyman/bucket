      "title": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of a de novo C9ORF72 knock-in isogenic iPSC cell bank to model ALS and FTD",
      "content": "Background: The pathogenic G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Studies focused on delineating the underlying perturbed mechanisms resulting from this genetic mutation are often confounded by the heterogeneity present in current disease models, such as patient-derived iPSC lines, with estimations of between 5-46% of the variation in iPSC cell phenotypes resulting from inter-individual differences. Isogenic models, in which the pathogenic mutation is introduced into a defined genetic background, offer a powerful approach to isolating mutation-specific effects and enable high-resolution comparison across distinct ALS/FTD-associated mutations. Such models are essential for uncovering convergent disease mechanisms and improving reproducibility in ALS/FTD research. Methods: A two-step scarless CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy was used to generate isogenic human iPSC lines carrying a de novo knock-in of a disease-length G4C2 repeat expansion in theC9ORF72 locus. The resulting lines underwent thorough quality control and were differentiated into lower motor neurons and assessed for the presence of key ALS/FTD pathologies, including changes to C9ORF72 mRNA and protein expression, RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins. Results: Two C9ORF72 knock-in iPSC lines were generated with 631 and 600 G4C2 repeats, alongside an isogenic genome editing control line. The C9ORF72 G4C2repeat expansion knock-in iPSC lines exhibit both loss-of-function and gain-of-function pathological features characteristic of ALS/FTD. Compared to the parental wild-type KOLF2.1J line and isogenic (wild-type) CRISPR control line, these exhibit a significant reduction in C9ORF72 mRNA and protein levels, the presence of RNA foci accumulation, and a marked increase in poly(GA) and poly(GP) dipeptide repeat protein levels in iPSCs and motor neurons. Conclusions: This is one of the first reports of a successful knock-in of the pathogenic C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansion into a human iPSC line, establishing a genetically defined and physiologically relevant model of ALS/FTD. These isogenic lines recapitulate both key loss- and gain-of-function disease pathologies, providing a crucial complement to existing patient-derived iPSC banks. By eliminating confounding genetic background variability, these cell lines will enable more precise interrogation of C9ORF72-linked pathomechanisms and offer a robust platform for comparative studies across the ALS and FTD spectrum, mechanistic investigations, and future therapeutic targeting with enhanced translational relevance.",

      "title": "Mycophenolate mofetil reduces the branching of microglial processes",
      "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play important roles not only in immune response but also in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural circuit formation. Microglia also surveil the brain environment via elongation and retraction of their processes. Previously, we found that the purine salvage pathway is involved in the regulation of morphology and dynamics of the microglial cell line BV2. Here, we show that intraperitoneal administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, reduces microglial branching during postnatal development. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MMF administration decreases guanosine nucleotides in the brain. Interestingly, despite the essential role of guanosine nucleotides in cellular proliferation, MMF administration did not significantly affect microglial proliferation. On the other hand, MMF administration attenuated the level of GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Rac1 small GTPases. Notably, MMF administration decreased the number of branches, while process length remained unaffected. Since microglial branching affects microglial complexity and diversity, our findings suggest that guanosine nucleotide production is essential for generating proper microglial diversity.",

      "title": "Temporal cueing improves audition with no evidence for attentional tradeoffs",
      "content": "Temporal cues help us focus attention at just the right moment. Whereas visual temporal attention selectively boosts perception at attended times at a cost to other moments, it remains unclear whether auditory temporal attention operates under the same constraints. To address this question, we designed a two-target temporal cueing task where participants discriminated the frequency sweep direction of one of two successive auditory stimuli, separated by 250 ms, while temporal attention was directed to one or both time points. We found that temporal attention improved auditory discrimination only for the first time point and could then remain sustained across the interval, without evidence of attentional tradeoffs across time. Further, manipulating auditory feature uncertainty changed overall performance but did not modulate the impact of temporal attention or yield tradeoffs. Finally, comparison to previous data from a closely matched visual task confirmed that while temporal attention enhanced perception in both vision and audition, only vision shows tradeoffs at this timescale. Altogether the results suggest that the temporal constraints on attention are modality-dependent.",

      "content": "Proprioceptive feedback from muscles is essential for continuous monitoring and precise control of limb movement, yet how such peripheral feedback is integrated into ongoing descending motor cortical dynamics remains largely unclear. Here we used precisely timed optogenetic stimulation of forelimb muscles to manipulate proprioceptive signals during a mouse reach-to-consume task. Mice were able to successfully reach and consume despite muscle stimulation-evoked forelimb deviations. Across the cortex, the caudal forelimb area (CFA) was preferentially activated by muscle-specific proprioceptive inputs and contributed to stabilizing perturbed forelimb movement. CFA extratelencephalic (ET) neurons encoded movement kinematics as well as proprioceptive feedback. At neuron population level, proprioceptive perturbations rapidly deflected CFA ET neural trajectories away from the task-relevant manifold yet exerted only limited effects on evolving task dynamics. These results reveal that descending cortical circuit implements activity subspace separation to encode and integrate distorted proprioceptive feedback while preserving task-relevant output.",

      "title": "Investigating the Effects of APOE Genotype on Intracellular Cholesterol and the Endolysosomal System in the Aging Mouse Brain",
      "content": "Individuals who possess the {epsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) are at a significantly increased risk for developing Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the precise reason for this association is not fully understood. Beyond its effects on amyloid and tau, APOE also influences fundamental cellular processes in the brain, including cholesterol trafficking between cells and within the endolysosomal system, which may be a critical component of the APOE4-associated vulnerability to AD. Here, we examined how APOE genotype, sex, and aging alter intracellular cholesterol processing and the endolysosomal system in the mouse brain. Using the novel cholesterol-binding probe D4H*-mCherry, we quantified intracellular cholesterol levels, the levels of early endosomes (Rab5), late endosomes (CD63), and lysosomes (LAMP1), and the colocalization of cholesterol with these endolysosomal compartments. This analysis was performed in the cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex of young, middle-aged, and old APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 mice. Our analysis revealed region-specific changes in intracellular cholesterol and the endolysosomal system in response to aging, sex, and APOE genotype. Notably, young APOE4 mice showed reduced cholesterol within early and late endosomes, but increased lysosomal abundance, suggesting impaired cholesterol processing. These APOE4-specific effects were less apparent in older animals. These effects were strongly modified by sex, with female APOE4 mice exhibiting elevated lysosomal cholesterol in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at old age, indicating sex-dependent susceptibility. Together, these results reveal that APOE genotype, age, and sex interact to influence endolysosomal cholesterol homeostasis, with female APOE4 mice showing the greatest dysregulation. These findings suggest that early and region-specific endolysosomal defects may contribute to the heightened AD risk associated with APOE4, particularly in females.",

      "title": "Sequence preparation is not always associated with a reaction time cost",
      "content": "The extent to which a sequence of movements is prepared before initiating the first movement is a longstanding question in motor neuroscience. The observation that reaction time (RT) increases for longer sequences has been used as evidence of sequence preparation; reflecting the additional demands of preparing multiple movements before initiating a sequential action. However, many processes contribute to RT, making it unclear whether the observed RT increases specifically reflect sequence preparation. For example, with longer sequences, participants face greater ambiguity in selecting their first movement in the sequence. Here, we test how much of the observed RT increases can be explained by the first-target ambiguity when reaching toward spatial targets. In our paradigm, we independently manipulate: (i) the number of future targets displayed, (ii) the number of targets to be acquired, and (iii) the spatial arrangement of the targets. This approach allows us to vary the demands of sequence preparation and first-target ambiguity, thereby enabling a direct assessment of their respective influence on RT. We report that RT increases with additional sequence elements but that this effect is fully explained by the ambiguity in selecting the first reach target. That is, sequence preparation causes no RT increase. In fact, when first-target ambiguity is eliminated, RT is constant across the number of displayed targets even though kinematic analysis reveals that participants have prepared a sequence. Together, these results indicate that preparing multiple reaches to spatial targets does not impose additional temporal costs relative to preparing a single reach.",

      "content": "Background: Identifying the stimulation brain target is fundamental for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Currently, this process is time-consuming and heavily dependent on the operator s expertise. Objective: This study evaluated a deep learning based approach to structural brain connectivity for improving stimulation site prediction and real time cortical excitability mapping during neuronavigation. Results: Tractography derived connectivity features and distal myographic responses were used to train four neural network models across five subjects. Neural network inputs were incrementally varied using either tractography alone, coil coordinates alone, or hybrid combinations of both using different concatenation regimes. The best performance was observed in two subjects out of 5, where hybrid models integrating coil coordinates and fiber information achieved higher F1 scores and accuracy. Conclusion: Despite these promising results, substantial inter-subject variability was observed. This approach may also be applied to other brain regions to investigate connectivity, and the use of machine learning could be extended to functional domains beyond the motor cortex, including sensory and cognitive areas.",
