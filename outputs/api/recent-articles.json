      "title": "Inhibition of histone lysine demethylase restores learning and memory in aged mice",
      "content": "Chromatin undergoes dramatic changes during the ageing process. In the brain, these chromatin changes are thought to underlie age-associated deficits in the activity-dependent gene transcription necessary for memory consolidation. Here, we show that the levels of a specific histone post-translational modification, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me3) is markedly increased in the hippocampus of aged mice and that the activity-induced increase in H3K4me3 that is observed in response to a learning stimulus in young mice, is severely blunted in the aged hippocampus. H3K4me3 typically marks open, accessible chromatin at the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of actively transcribed genes. We identify altered H3K4me3 peaks at TSSs and show that ca. 90% of the activity-induced H3K4me3 changes at TSSs are either absent or reduced in the aged hippocampus. To understand the biological significance of these age-associated changes, we screened a library of pharmacological compounds for compounds that can alter H3K4me3 levels in hippocampal neurons. We show that treatment of aged mice with one of these, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001, restored normal learning and memory in object location and recognition tasks. Furthermore, we show that ORY-1001 treatment increased long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity deficient in the aged hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting the epigenetic machinery that regulates activity-dependent gene transcription may represent an avenue for treating age-associated cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Closed-loop acoustic stimulation modified by cathodal tDCS is beneficial for retention",
      "content": "We investigated how combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) during slow-wave sleep (SWS) affects memory consolidation and sleep-related neural oscillations. Cathodal tDCS was used to slightly reduce cortical excitability, thereby simulating a shifted brain state during CLAS and allowing us to compare the effects of standard CLAS to CLAS delivered under altered cortical conditions (CmodCLAS). Twenty-three participants [mean age (SD) 21.3 (2.6) years] completed two experimental nights: one with CLAS alone and one with CLAS combined with cathodal tDCS (CmodCLAS). Overnight retention on declarative memory tasks and morning learning performance were assessed. Memory outcomes revealed that CmodCLAS, but not CLAS alone, significantly improved overnight retention on the figural paired-associate task. In the EEG, CmodCLAS shifted the time-locked response to acoustic stimulation toward more negative potential values at the frontal region. CmodCLAS also prolonged slow oscillation (SO) duration at frontal sites while shortening SO duration at occipital sites, an effect not observed during standard CLAS. These findings demonstrate that the baseline level of cortical excitability during sleep modulates both the cognitive and electrophysiological effects of CLAS. They highlight the importance of brain state for non-invasive CLAS during sleep and suggest that CmodCLAS may serve as a useful approach for enhancing prefrontal cortical function during SWS.",

      "title": "A neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal assessments of transplanted human cortical organoids in vivo",
      "content": "Human cortical organoids (hCOs) are three-dimensional neural cell aggregates that recapitulate certain structural and functional aspects of the developing human cortex. Xenotransplantation of hCOs into the rodent brain enables human-centric modeling of neurodevelopmental processes in a physiologically relevant environment. Here, we present a neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal structural and functional assessment of hCO xenografts as they mature in vivo. Single hCOs were implanted into the retrosplenial cortex of adult immunodeficient mice and monitored for up to 8 months. Optical coherence tomography was used for label-free imaging of xenograft vascularization and structure, enabling quantitative assessments of capillary density and graft volume. To probe neuronal activity, human neurons were labeled with a calcium sensor before implantation using either adeno-associated or lentivirus for sparse or dense neuronal labeling, respectively. Fluorescent imaging was conducted using two-photon, widefield, and swept confocally-aligned planar excitation microscopy for single cell, whole-graft, and volumetric calcium imaging, respectively. Results from these modalities indicate an increase in neuronal activity and synchronicity over time during in vivo graft maturation. Further, we chronically implanted surface graphene microelectrode arrays (gMEAs) and performed recordings of xenograft and host local field potential signals simultaneously with 2P calcium imaging, confirming the spatial localization and human origin of electrical signals recorded at the xenograft surface.",

      "title": "Adjacent Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) Regions Participate in Distinct Large-Scale Networks Differentially Recruited for Social and Cognitive Control Functions",
      "content": "Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is heterogenous. In monkeys, side-by-side PFC regions, including within dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), show distinct long-range anatomical projection profiles, raising the possibility that adjacent regions might specialize as a consequence of the distributed networks in which they are embedded. Consistent with this possibility, recent findings in humans provide evidence for PFC regions domain-specialized for scene (spatial) processing and language processing that are adjacent to distinct domain-flexible regions responding to traditional cognitive control demands. Here we tested functional specialization of PFC regions linked to another domain-specialized network recruited by certain forms of social processing (theory-of-mind, ToM, tasks). Using within-individual precision neuroimaging approaches, side-by-side DLPFC regions embedded within parallel distributed networks were identified within the idiosyncratic anatomy of each individual (N=13). Functional responses between these distinct regions revealed a robust functional double dissociation: one DLPFC region was preferentially recruited by ToM tasks and an adjacent DLPFC region by working memory task demands. The region responding to social processing demands was small and its position varied slightly from one person to the next suggesting why it may have been underappreciated in past group-based analyses. These findings add to evidence that PFC features more functional specialization than commonly appreciated and further that the specialization of juxtaposed regions within PFC can be understood by examining the distributed networks within which the regions are embedded.",

      "title": "Anatomical White Matter Tracts Span the Cortical Hierarchy to Support Cognitive Diversity",
      "content": "Long-range white matter (WM) tracts support cognition by enabling communication between distant cortical regions, which are organized along a hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. However, it remains unknown how WM tracts are positioned within the cortical hierarchy to support cognition. Here, we show that WM tracts are differentially positioned in the cortical hierarchy to support specific cognitive functions, and that tracts spanning the hierarchy connect regions with greater cognitive diversity. Moreover, tracts situated within the same hierarchical level connect biologically similar regions, while those crossing the hierarchy bridge distinct biological milieux to support diverse cognitive functions. The placement of tracts in the cortical hierarchy also reflects developmental variation in tract microstructure and individual differences in cognition. Together, these findings provide a framework that moves beyond conventional categories of association or projection tracts and links WM tract anatomy to cortical organization, cognitive function, cortical neurobiology, and neurodevelopment. We anticipate that this cortex-anchored framework for describing WM tracts may aid the interpretation of individual differences in WM structure related to development and behavior.",

      "title": "Integration of gene expression with computational modeling reveals region-specific brain energy metabolism dysregulation in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder with suggested disturbances in multiple neurobiological pathways including brain energy metabolism, which is essential for sustaining precise neuronal signaling. The relationship between gene expression alterations and energy metabolism defects, however, is poorly understood. Here we combined differential expression (DE) analysis with computational modeling to investigate how the expression of cytosolic energy metabolism-associated genes influences the concentrations of key energy metabolites. The DE analysis used human post-mortem RNA sequencing data from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from the Common Mind Consortium. Metabolic simulations were carried out using a biophysical model of brain energy metabolism (Winter et al. 2018). We conducted both population-average and subject-specific simulations and assessed the effects of DE genes individually and collectively.  The DE analysis identified nine genes in the ACC and 24 in the DLPFC. Approximately two thirds of the DE genes were downregulated in schizophrenia in both brain areas. Decreased expression of neuronal  LDHB  in the ACC caused a decrease of pyruvate and an increase of NAD+/NADH ratio. Furthermore, decreased expression of neuronal PFKM in the DLPFC caused an increase of glucose and NAD+/NADH ratio and a decrease of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. These findings provide evidence for region-specific dysregulation of brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia and suggest mechanistic links between gene expression changes and altered levels of key energy metabolites.",
