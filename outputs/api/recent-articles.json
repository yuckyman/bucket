      "content": "ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to quantify Sylvian fissure angle (SFA) development via fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and establish the reference range and growth curve during normal pregnancy.Materials and methodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study collected 324 singleton fetuses at 22\u201338\u202fweeks of gestation (GA), without abnormal signs on MRI or chromosomal defects, from January 2022 to December 2023. Six SFAs were defined and measured: Sylvian fissure plateau angle (SFPA), Sylvian fissure anterior rotation angle (SFARA), and Sylvian fissure posterior rotation angle (SFPRA) in the transthalamic axial plane, and SFPA, Sylvian fissure superior rotation angle (SFSRA), and Sylvian fissure inferior rotation angle (SFIRA) in the third ventricular coronal plane. Then, the correlation between the SFAs and GA was analyzed, and the growth curve model was used. Retrospective cortical malformation cases validated the model. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate interobserver variability of the SFA measurements.ResultsICC for SFA measurements demonstrated good reliability (0.772\u20130.976). The bilateral SFARA and SFSRA were significantly positively associated with GA (r\u202f=\u202f0.914, 0.926, 0.842, 0.836, left to right, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The bilateral SFPRA, SFIRA, and SFPA (both axial and coronal views) were negatively associated with GA (r value range: \u22120.601 to \u22120.145, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For each SFA and GA, the quadratic curve has the best goodness of fit. The model detected cortical malformation (genetically confirmed). Except for the SFARA, all SFAs were statistically different between the two sides.ConclusionThe dynamic development of the fetal SFA can be well evaluated using MRI. The SFA\u2019s reference range will enhance the accuracy of fetal brain assessment and offer a quantitative reference framework for identifying deviations suggestive of cortical malformations.",

      "title": "Rhythm increases perceptual tolerance when measuring electrically evoked compound action potentials in cochlear implant recipients",
      "content": "In cochlear implant (CI) recipients, measurement of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is used in clinical routine to prove the electrode-nerve interface and to support fitting, especially in very young children. To record an ECAP amplitude growth function (AGF), electrical stimuli are presented at increasing intensities up to the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL). However, a continuously monotonically rising sound can quickly be perceived as unpleasant and thus impair the success rate of ECAP threshold determination. The present study investigates whether perceptual and objective parameters, which are involved in ECAP measurements, depend on the type of stimulus presentation. In 27 subjects with a CI (28 implants), stimuli of five different AGF patterns were presented ten times in random order at a medial electrode contact, resulting in a total of 50 AGFs per implant. One pattern (Pclin) in which the stimuli increase strictly monotonically is already implemented in the clinical software (MAESTRO). The present study also employed rhythmic patterns and patterns with pauses. The behavioral threshold (THR), the maximum comfortable level (MCL), the MAL, and objective ECAP threshold were analyzed. ECAP threshold values did not change significantly when different stimulus paradigms were applied. Rhythmic AGF patterns were perceived as less unpleasant and enabled a higher MAL compared to Pclin. This in turn led to improved ECAP threshold determination, with the success rate rising to 86.7%, compared to 79.1% for Pclin.",

      "title": "Effects of fatigue on motor unit characteristics in isometric elbow contractions across age groups",
      "content": "This study aims to investigate the neuromuscular regulation mechanisms in different age groups under conditions of fatigue. A total of 50 participants aged between 10 and 80\u202fyears were recruited and divided into 11 different age groups. Each participant performed a triangular wave isometric contraction before and after fatigue. The convolution kernel compensation algorithm was employed to extract the motor unit (MU) spike trains from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. The extracted features included root mean square, mean power frequency, motor unit action potential (MUAP) peak-to-peak values, MUAP duration, recruitment threshold, derecruitment threshold, discharge frequency, and common neural drive, which were compared across age groups before and after fatigue. Significant variations in fatigue adaptation were observed among age groups, according to the study. Adults tend to recruit larger motor units to compensate for fatigue-induced strength decline. The elderly group\u2019s discharge frequency and MU recruitment threshold, on the other hand, did not significantly change, indicating that their neuromuscular system was less able to adjust to fatigue. The child group may have relied more on discharge frequency modulation during fatigue because they displayed smaller variations in recruitment threshold. At the same time, PCA results showed that fatigue induced a greater reduction in common-drive coherence in children and older adults, suggesting that maintaining coordinated neural drive becomes more challenging during development and aging. This study clarifies the differences in neuromuscular fatigue adaptation mechanisms at different stages of life and reveals the changing patterns of MU regulation strategies across the examined age range. The resulting age-dependent MU patterns provide an important physiological reference for neurological healthcare, facilitating clearer identification and interpretation of deviations associated with neuromuscular and neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Superoxide dismutase is associated with cerebral small vessel disease burden and vascular mild cognitive impairment in elderly patients",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo examine the associations between superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and the burden of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as well as vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), in elderly patients.MethodsIn this study, a cohort of 286 elderly individuals was included. Each participant received a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Plasma SOD levels were evaluated. The cumulative CSVD burden was quantified using an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, based on four key imaging indicators of CSVD: white matter hyperintensity, deep cerebral microbleeds, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia. To evaluate the associations among SOD levels, CSVD burden, and cognitive function, we employed binary logistic regression analysis, tests for trend, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and mediation analysis.ResultsAfter adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of SOD were significantly associated with a reduced risk of VaMCI (OR: 0.919; 95% CI: 0.896\u20130.943; P < 0.001) and a lower likelihood of severe CSVD burden (OR: 0.980; 95% CI: 0.968\u20130.992; P = 0.001) in elderly patients. Compared with the lowest quartile of SOD levels, the OR for VaMCI in the highest quartile of SOD levels was 0.039 (95% CI: 0.016\u20130.100; P for trend < 0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders. For severe CSVD burden, the corresponding OR was 0.442 (95% CI: 0.214\u20130.913; P for trend = 0.011). Mediation analysis revealed that the severe CSVD burden significantly moderated the relationship between SOD levels and VaMCI.ConclusionElevated SOD levels serve as a protective factor against severe CSVD burden and VaMCI in elderly patients. A portion of the protective effect of increased SOD on VaMCI may be attributed to its role in mitigating the severity of CSVD.",

      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

Existing DBS devices often lack suitability for rodent models, which are essential for exploring these mechanisms. The objective of this study is to design a wearable DBS device that enables more effective rodent behavior research.MethodsWe developed a stimulator specifically designed for rodent behavioral research. The device features several key advantages, including low weight (5 g excluding battery), compact size (30 mm \u00d7 38 mm), and extended battery life (\u2265300 hours). Additionally, it integrates low-power Bluetooth, allowing for real-time wireless adjustment of stimulation parameters, such as frequency (80\u2013150 Hz), pulse width (40\u2013340 \u03bcs), and amplitude (2.3\u20133 V).ResultsThe stimulating effect of this device has been verified in a model of mild Parkinson\u2019s disease (mild Parkinsonism) in rats, indicating that the device is effective in regulating the motor functions of rodents with Parkinson\u2019s disease-like conditions.DiscussionThis wearable DBS device shows broad applicability in behavior-based studies and offers a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of various brain nuclei in rodent models.

      "content": "Objective. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of surgical targeting and DBS programming.",

      "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",

      "title": "Temporal properties of direct current sensory block of the rat sciatic nerve using the C-fiber reflex",
      "content": "Objective. Direct current (DC) electrical block of peripheral sensory axons has potential for clinical applications in pain management. The C-fiber reflex (CFR), elicited via noxious stimulation of the foot, is suitable for investigating the activation of unmyelinated C-fiber nerves, the fiber class that is responsible for lingering pain sensations. Approach. In anesthetized rats, the CFR was elicited via electrical stimulation to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and the resulting C-fiber-evoked electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the ipsilateral biceps femoris muscle. A carbon separated interface nerve electrode was used to deliver DC block to arrest action potentials in the sciatic nerve. The efficacy of the block was observed as a reduction/abolition of the magnitude of the EMG in a time window corresponding to the latency of C-fibers activity. Main results. Complete cessation of nerve activity could be achieved instantaneously by applying DC at the \u2018block threshold (BT)\u2019. At amplitudes below the BT, complete block could be induced over a period of seconds to minutes, with lower currents being correlated with longer induction times. When block was applied for prolonged periods of time, block was sustained following the cessation of DC delivery. This \u2018recovery period\u2019 was longer for longer durations of block application. Significance. The CFR is an established method to investigate pharmaceutical pain therapies, yet to date, has not been used to assess electrical block of sensory axons. Therefore, anatomical and electrophysiological methods were used to validate this method. DC nerve block shows promise for clinical pain management applications. Furthermore, the temporal properties described here could be used to reduce overall electrical current delivery and improve safety.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
