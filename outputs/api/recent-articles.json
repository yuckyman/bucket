      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've had decent success with pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3 in the past, and I've never really clicked with Cython for text-processing-heavy work. For my latest project, though, I decided to skip binding frameworks entirely and work directly with Python's C API.</p> <p>For a typical text parsing / templating workload, my reasoning went something like this:</p> <ol> <li>If we care about performance, we want to avoid copying or re-encoding potentially large input strings.</li> <li>If we're processing an opaque syntax tree (or other internal representation) with contextual data in the form of Python objects, we want to avoid data object wrappers or other indirect access to that data.</li> <li>If the result is a potentially large string, we want to avoid copying or re-encoding before handing it back to Python.</li> <li>If we exposing a large syntax tree to Python, we want to avoid indirect access for every node in the tree.</li> </ol> <p>The obvious downside is that we have to deal with manual memory management and Python reference counting. That is what I've been practicing with <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">Nano Template</a>.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">Nano Template</a> is a fast, non-evaluating template engine with syntax that should look familiar if you've used Jinja, Minijinja, or Django templates.</p> <p>Unlike those engines, Nano Template deliberately has a reduced feature set. The idea is to keep application logic out of template text. Instead of manipulating data inside the template, you're expected to prepare it in Python before rendering.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>import nano_template as nt template = nt.parse(&quot;&quot;&quot;\\ {% if page['heading override'] -%} # {{ page['heading override'] }} {% else -%} # Welcome to {{ page.title }}! {% endif %} Hello, {{ you or 'guest' }}. {% for tag in page.tags ~%} - {{ tag.name }} {% endfor -%} &quot;&quot;&quot;) data = { &quot;page&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Demo page&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 42}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;python&quot;}], } } result = template.render(data) print(result) </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Nano Template is for Python developers who want improved performance from a template engine at the expense of features.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>A provisional benchmark shows Nano Template to be about 17 times faster than a pure Python implementation, and about 4 times faster than Minijinja, when measuring parsing and rendering together.</p> <p>For scenarios where you're parsing once and rendering many times, Jinja2 tends to beat Minijinja. Nano Template is still about 2.8 time faster than Jinja2 and bout 7.5 time faster than Minijinja in that scenario.</p> <p>Excluding parsing time and limiting our benchmark fixture to simple variable substitution, Nano Template renders about 10% slower than <code>str.format()</code> (we're using cPython's limited C API, which comes with a performance cost).</p> <pre><code>$ python scripts/benchmark.py (001) 5 rounds with 10000 iterations per round. parse c ext : best = 0.092587s | avg = 0.092743s parse pure py : best = 2.378554s | avg = 2.385293s just render c ext : best = 0.061812s | avg = 0.061850s just render pure py : best = 0.314468s | avg = 0.315076s just render jinja2 : best = 0.170373s | avg = 0.170706s just render minijinja : best = 0.454723s | avg = 0.457256s parse and render ext : best = 0.155797s | avg = 0.156455s parse and render pure py : best = 2.733121s | avg = 2.745028s parse and render jinja2 : &lt;with caching disabled, I got bored waiting&gt; parse and render minijinja : best = 0.705995s | avg = 0.707589s $ python scripts/benchmark_format.py (002) 5 rounds with 1000000 iterations per round. render template : best = 0.413830s | avg = 0.419547s format string : best = 0.375050s | avg = 0.375237s </code></pre> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Jinja or Minijinja are still usually the right choice for a general-purpose template engine. They are well established and plenty fast enough for most use cases (especially if you're parsing once and rendering many times with Jinja).</p> <p>For me, this was mainly a stepping-stone project to get more comfortable with C, the Python C API, and the tooling needed to write and publish safe C extensions. My next project is to rewrite <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest\">Python Pest</a> as a C extension using similar techniques.</p> <p>As always, feedback is most welcome.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template\">https://github.com/jg-rp/nano-template</a><br /> PyPi: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nano-template/\">https://pypi.org/project/nano-template/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hefty-Pianist-1958\"> /u/Hefty-Pianist-1958 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pn51h1/my_first_c_extension/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pn51h1/my_first_c_extension/\">[comments]</a></span>",

We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
