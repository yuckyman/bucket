      "title": "PRO-FitS: a novel phenotypic assay to identify enhancers of proteostasis in C. elegans",
      "content": "The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) continues to rise with the aging of populations worldwide, representing a pressing need for the establishment of therapeutic strategies. Maintaining proteostasis is crucial for healthy aging, as the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a key contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction and disease. This study introduces a novel phenotypic assay using Caenorhabditis elegans to screen for small molecule enhancers of proteostasis, aiming at mitigating the proteotoxic stress associated with NDs. This new methodology- PRO-FitS- uses C. elegans motor activity as a proxy for the PROteome Fitness State upon a noxious protein-denaturating stimulus, while allowing a fast and experimenter-free readout. We demonstrate the efficacy of the assay by validating the role of pharmacological mTOR inhibition and serotonergic signaling activation in reducing heat shock-induced proteotoxic damage at the whole-organism level. PRO-FitS will allow the identification of novel compounds that alleviate protein aggregation disorders, potentially revealing new pathways and cellular targets not previously implicated in proteotoxicity.",

      "title": "Exogenously driven neural reactivation of spatially matching visual working-memory contents",
      "content": "Selective attention is often divided into voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) forms, a distinction extensively studied for attention to external sensory input. In contrast, internal selective attention--directed toward representations held in working memory (WM)--has been considered primarily for voluntary influences. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that task-irrelevant external stimuli can also influence internal selection of feature-matching WM representations involuntarily, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we tested whether an uninformative exogenous spatial retro-cue presented during a WM delay can act as a selective ''ping'' and reactivate spatially matching WM content at the level of its representational category. Male and female human participants memorized complex contents presented at distinct locations, followed by unpredictive and task-irrelevant spatial retro-cues that conveyed no category information. Using temporally resolved multivariate EEG decoding, we observed category-specific reactivation of spatially matching WM representations following these cues, providing direct neural evidence for stimulus-driven, involuntary attentional selection within WM, ahead of the memory test. Moreover, neural responses to the subsequent memory-probe were also modulated by cue congruency, consistent with the notion that exogenous influences begin early during sensory processing while also shaping later decision-related processes. Finally, drift-diffusion model analyses revealed that this involuntary cueing effect was primarily driven by increased evidence accumulation. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which external events can automatically and involuntarily penetrate the internal cognitive workspace.",

      "title": "State-Dependent Dissociation of Shared Input and Directed Information Flow in the Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Understanding how brain state and sensory input shape inter-laminar communication is essential for interpreting cortical population dynamics. Using laminar recordings in macaque V1, we apply reduced-rank regression to quantify low-dimensional predictive subspaces linking Input and Superficial layers. We find that both visual stimulation and internal state (eyes open vs. closed) modulate the structure and efficacy of these subspaces, but through distinct mechanisms. Visual input induces a directional, feedforward pattern from input to superficial layers, while wakefulness-related modulation enhances coordination more symmetrically. Delay analysis and network simulations confirm that structured, layer-specific inputs produce directional prediction, whereas global fluctuations yield undirected co-activation. Importantly, differential structure across layers predicts the emergence of communication asymmetry. These findings dissociate communication from shared modulation, providing a principled framework for interpreting inter-population correlations. Our results generalize to broader cortical circuits, offering insights into when population coupling reflects genuine information flow versus global state dynamics.",

You define rules in YAML or Python and run them against datasets(Parquet, Postgres, SQL SERVER, CSV), and get back violation counts, sampled failing rows, and more.</p> <p>It is designed to avoid unnecessary work. Some checks can be answered from file or database metadata and other are pushed down to SQL. Rules that cannot be validated with SQL or metadata, fall back to in-memory validation using Polars, loading only the required columns.</p> <p>Under the hood it uses DuckDB for SQL pushdown on files.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Kontra is intended for production use in data pipelines and ETL jobs. It acts like a lightweight unit test for data, fast validation and profiling that measures dataset properties with out trying to enforce some policy or make decisions.</p> <p>Its is designed to be built on top of, with structured results that can be consumed by pipelines or automated workflows. It\u00b4s a good fit for anyone who needs fast validation or quick insight into data.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>There are several tools and frameworks for data quality that are often designed as a broader platforms with their own workflows and conventions. Kontra is smaller in scope. It focuses on fast measurement and reporting, with an execution model that separates metadata-based checks, SQL pushdown and in-memory validation.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Saevarl/Kontra\">https://github.com/Saevarl/Kontra</a><br /> PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/kontra/\">https://pypi.org/project/kontra/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Particular_Panda_295\"> /u/Particular_Panda_295 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlzqt2/kontra_a_python_library_for_data_quality/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlzqt2/kontra_a_python_library_for_data_quality/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Hippocampal tangential insertions of high-density silicone probes in head-fixed mice enhance spatial sampling",
      "content": "The hippocampus is a key structure within the medial temporal lobe which plays a central role in the formation and consolidation of declarative memories. Despite technological progress, a full understanding of hippocampal rhythms, neuronal population activity, and the underlying connectivity remain elusive, partly due to its complex morphology in a croissant-like shape which limits coronal and sagittal approaches. To address this limitation, we propose two different tangential insertions of high-density electrode probes aligned to either the dorsal or ventral sections of the hippocampus. Each approach enables the placement of up to 384 recording sites within the hippocampal formation. Both insertions are performed in head-fixed condition, which further allows for detailed monitoring of the animals behavioral states, including spontaneous running and facial movements. The two proposed tangential dorsal and ventral insertions capture almost continuously the physiology of the hippocampus across 3.84 mm of tissue. When placed across the pyramidal layer, such insertions can harness ripple oscillations over 120 channels, corresponding to approximately ~1.2 mm of tissue, with a coverage of 2 channels every 20 micrometer. Furthermore, such insertions enabled us to record up to 400 hippocampal neurons simultaneously from a single probe, endowing us with the capability to capture within a single recording several hundreds of functionally connected neuronal pairs. Lastly, these insertions were performed in head-fixed mice on a running band, which can be combined with high frequency sampling camera, allowing us to precisely monitor facial movements, and their hippocampal correlates. An orthogonal/vertical approach is a more standard way to record electrophysiological activity from most brain regions, including the hippocampus. Vertical insertions thereby miss the antero-posterior axis of the brain in the hippocampus and therefore putative propagating events. Furthermore, vertical insertions have a lower reach in terms of number of channels, single units, and spatial density being recorded, even with multi-shank high-density probes. Tangential insertions therefore substantially increase spatial reach and resolution, which leads to a higher number of cells recorded in a single insertion along the antero-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, compared to freely moving approaches, head-fixed conditions enable precise monitoring of facial movements. Dorsal and ventral head-fixed tangential insertions of Neuropixels probes in the hippocampus increase the resolution and spatial extent of recordings, allowing more precise and extensive monitoring of network activity and its underlying connectivity.",

      "title": "Virtual prototyping of non-invasive spinal cord electrical stimulation targeting upper limb motor function",
      "content": "Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied over the cervical or lumbar spinal cord facilitates motor function after paralysis. However, emerging electrophysiological evidence indicates mechanistic differences between cervical and lumbar tSCS and across different cervical tSCS paradigms. To clarify these discrepancies, we developed and validated a multi-scale, whole-body computational model of tSCS-induced volume conduction, axonal recruitment, and synaptic transmission. Across 24 cervical and four lumbar tSCS paradigms, simulations showed that somatosensory afferents consistently exhibit lower stimulation thresholds than motor efferents. In turn, region-specific synaptic transmission differences may explain electrophysiological discrepancies between cervical and lumbar tSCS. Across cervical tSCS paradigms, substantial volume conduction and axonal recruitment differences were observed that explain electrophysiological discrepancies. Specifically, clinically-prevalent paradigms, including those with anodes placed over the clavicles or iliac crests, engaged peripheral nerves in addition to spinal roots. This effect was amplified by multiphasic waveforms, which introduced recruitment sites near the anodes. By integrating simulations with electrophysiological recordings in 14 able-bodied individuals, we investigated previously unexplored cervical tSCS paradigms on their capacity to recruit somatosensory afferents relative to motor threshold.",

      "title": "When the brightest is not the best: illuminant estimation from the geometry of specular highlights",
      "content": "Color constancy allows us to perceive stable object colors under different lighting conditions by reducing the impact of lighting. Information about illuminant color could be derived from a white surface or a specular highlight. The 'brightest is white' heuristic has been frequently incorporated in illumination estimation models, to identify illuminant color. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis: we use structured changes in the proximal image to identify highlight regions, even when they are not the brightest elements in the scene. In computer-rendered scenes, we varied the reliability of 'brightest element' and 'highlight geometry' cues, testing their effect on a color constancy task. Each scene had a single spherical surface lit by several point lights with identical spectral properties. The surface had a uniform spectral reflectance but a noise texture that attenuated the reflectance by a variable scale factor. We tested three levels of specularity: zero (matte), low, and mid. Observers watched a 1.5-second animation and responded if color changes were due to illuminant or material changes. Discrimination performance for matte surfaces was nearly at chance level, as predicted. However, as specularity increased, performance improved significantly. Observers outperformed an ideal observer model who relied solely on the brightest element. Notably, when the specular region appeared on a dark part of the texture, observer performance improved even more even though the brightest element heuristic would predict a decrease. When specular geometries were difficult to identify due to phase scrambling, observer performance significantly dropped. These results suggest that we do not simply rely on the brightest element, but rather utilize regularities of diffuse and specular components of the proximal image to solve surface and illuminant ambiguities.",

      "title": "Uncovering Dynamic Neural Information Flow with Continuous-Time Weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks",
      "content": "Understanding how information dynamically flows within neural systems is a crucial problem in neuroscience. Traditional approaches often assume stationary or quasi-stationary functional networks, which fail to capture the time-varying dynamics of interactions among neural variables. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous-Time weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks (CTwDBN), a non-stationary graphical modeling framework for uncovering smoothly time-varying conditional dependencies. Validation on synthetic datasets demonstrated that CTwDBN reliably recovers the structure and dynamics of ground-truth information flow. Application to electrophysiological recordings during a guided saccade task revealed temporal fluctuations in conditional dependencies in the cortical network that persisted an order of magnitude longer than the receptive field dynamics. In the resting-state cortex, CTwDBN revealed persistent fluctuations within a low-dimensional dependency space reflecting canonical anatomical motifs. These results highlight CTwDBN as a versatile analytical framework for capturing dynamic information flow in neural systems with broad applicability to complex biological and artificial systems.",

      "content": "This study presents a stereotactic microbiopsy technique for sampling defined brain regions in living mice, enabling transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses without sacrificing the animal. The method will allow pre-intervention tissue collection, making it possible to separate preexisting molecular differences from experience- or treatment-induced changes. We show that microbiopsies yield sufficient, high-quality RNA and chromatin for sequencing, with minimal tissue damage that largely resolves over time. The procedure uses standard stereotactic equipment and achieves reproducible spatial precision when the syringe is stabilised. This approach provides a practical framework for within-subject molecular comparisons, reducing animal use and enabling longitudinal profiling of the living mouse brain. It establishes a foundation for investigating how baseline molecular states influence later physiological or behavioural outcomes.",

      "title": "The \tC. elegans nervous system reads the internal state of the hydrogen peroxide-detoxification machinery to trigger escape from this common reactive chemical",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the most common reactive chemical threat faced by organisms. Here, we map the neural circuit that drives chemotactic escape from environmental H2O2 in the nematode C. elegans. Twenty-four neuron classes with sensory endings at the mouth and nose of the animal detect H2O2. Their response dynamics encode stimulus intensity and exposure history, and their partial redundancy makes avoidance resilient to the loss of individual inputs. Sensing begins when H2O2 oxidizes the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of the cytosolic peroxiredoxin PRDX-2, which relays this oxidative signal to cysteines on the LITE-1 and GUR-3 ion channels, triggering calcium influx in sensory neurons that drive escape. Most of these neurons release glutamate to drive H2O2-dependent excitation of AIA interneurons, whereas others signal through non-glutamatergic routes, providing multiple routes for signal transmission. Thus, the C. elegans nervous system acts as a hydrogen peroxide sentinel that monitors H2O2-induced changes in the intracellular H2O2-detoxification machinery and relays them to interneurons driving organism-wide escape. This raises the possibility that circuit defects in aging and neurodegenerative disease arise from altered peroxiredoxin-mediated H2O2 signaling rather than primarily from direct macromolecular damage.",

      "title": "Understanding corticosterone fluctuations and HPA-axis regulation in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet expansion in the ATXN3 gene, primarily characterized by motor impairments. However, SCA3/MJD also includes mood-related comorbidities that affect both patients and their caregivers. Current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive care, as no disease-modifying therapies are available. Previously, we have demonstrated decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in post-mortem SCA3 human and mouse brains and elevated peripheral corticosterone (CORT) levels in SCA3 mice at late disease stages. Impaired GR signaling is typically associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, common in stress-related psychiatric diseases. Our study aimed to dissect the HPA-axis (dys)function and the effect of stress exposure on SCA3/MJD progression. Using the CMVMJD135 mouse model, we evaluated HPA-axis regulation in SCA3/MJD by measuring CORT levels throughout disease progression (6 to 34 weeks of age) under basal conditions and after acute stress. At week 35, these mice underwent a dexamethasone injection to challenge the HPA-axis, and the CORT levels were measured at different timepoints to evaluate the axis response. Additionally, we applied a 6-week chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol in another cohort of mice starting at an early symptomatic stage to assess stress effects on the progression of motor impairments. Our findings indicate that serum CORT levels in SCA3 mice begin to rise between 26 to 30 weeks of age, with no impairment in the physiological response to acute stress. SCA3 mice were also able to normalize CORT levels after dexamethasone challenge, suggesting normal HPA-axis function. While CUS exposure had a transient negative impact on the motor phenotype, this effect did not persist throughout disease progression. In conclusion, stressful events, either acute or chronic, do not seem to be major determinants of disease severity in SCA3 mice.",
