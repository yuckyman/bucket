      "title": "A Human Hippocampal Organoid Model with Sustained Neural Stem Cells Reveals State Shifts Under Glucocorticoid Stress",
      "content": "The human hippocampus is a critical brain region for learning, memory, and stress regulation, distinguished by its ability to sustain neurogenesis after birth. This plasticity is driven by hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), which generate new neurons and maintain circuit integrity, but are highly sensitive to environmental and pathological influences. Mechanistic insight into human hippocampal development and neurogenesis remains limited by the absence of physiologically relevant models. Here, we establish an optimized protocol to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hippocampal organoids that recapitulate key features of hippocampal development. These organoids maintain organized NSC niches, support ongoing neurogenesis, and generate hippocampus-specific cell types. Cellular, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses confirm progressive neuronal maturation, synapse formation, and functional activity, highlighting the physiological relevance of the system. Using this model, we modeled excess prenatal glucocorticoid exposure with dexamethasone, which perturbed NSC dynamics by reducing proliferation and inducing a precocious quiescent-like state. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of NSC activation genes and upregulation of quiescence- and autophagy-associated programs, suggesting that glucocorticoid signaling enforces an early transition toward quiescence. These findings reveal a mechanism by which excessive glucocorticoid exposure may impair hippocampal growth. Together, this study introduces a robust human hippocampal organoid platform for dissecting the regulation of hippocampal development and for modeling the impact of environmental stressors on human neurogenesis.",

      "title": "All Memories Are Equal at Night: Sleep Protects Without Preference for Strength",
      "content": "Objectives: Sleep benefits memory, but whether this benefit depends on initial memory strength remains heavily debated. We asked whether overnight sleep preferentially stabilizes weakly vs. strongly encoded declarative items, and whether classical sleep oscillations account for any benefit. Methods: Ninety healthy adults (n=30/group) learned 80 unrelated word pairs; half were presented twice (S-, weak), while the other half was studied three times (S+, strong). Memory retention was tested after (i) 9hrs containing nocturnal sleep (n= 30), (ii) a comparable daytime waking period (n= 30), or (iii) immediately (~40-min) after encoding. Accuracy (cued recall) and reaction times (RT) indexed memory accessibility. In the sleep group, polysomnography was used to quantify slow oscillation (SO) density as well as fast spindle intensity to study potential relations to memory performance. Results: Strongly encoded items (S+) were recalled better than weak items (S-) in all three groups. An interaction indicated that WAKE disproportionately forgot more weak items S- relative to strong S+ items, whereas SLEEP showed no differential benefit for weak versus strong items, with performance more closely resembling that of the immediate recall group. Reaction-time analyses echoed this pattern with WAKE responding more slowly than SLEEP and IMMEDIATE, and there is no RT difference between SLEEP and IMMEDIATE. S+ were retrieved faster than S- (with no group interaction). Finally, classical sleep markers did not account for overnight retention: spindle and slow-oscillation metrics showed no stronger associations on the learning night than on the adaptation night and did not differ by item strength, suggesting largely trait-like rather than state-dependent relationships between these oscillations and declarative memory. Conclusions: Sleep protects declarative memories irrespective of initial strength and matches immediate recall performance. Traditional sleep metrics, such as slow oscillation density and spindle intensity, did not predict overnight retention performance but instead reflected more trait-like relationships.",

      "title": "Inverse Neural-Kinematic Dynamics Revealed by RQA During Motor Skill Learning",
      "content": "Motor skill acquisition involves dynamic co-adaptation of brain and behavior, yet the temporal coupling between neural and kinematic processes during learning remains unclear. Traditional analyses often treat the brain and behavior independently, potentially overlooking their interactive dynamics. In this study, we applied Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), a nonlinear method for assessing temporal structure in complex systems, to both EEG and foot trajectory data collected during a seven-session motor learning task. Twelve healthy adults practiced drawing five shapes with their dominant foot on a digital tablet while EEG was recorded from sensorimotor cortex electrodes. We found a fundamental inverse relationship between neural and behavioral dynamics: as motor performance improved, EEG determinism in the left hemisphere increased by 2.7% (p<0.001), while kinematic determinism decreased by 18.4% (p<0.001), indicating more organized brain activity supporting more flexible movement patterns. EEG laminarity also increased by 1.5% (p<0.001), while kinematic laminarity decreased by 15.2% (p<0.001). Shape-specific analysis revealed that patterns B and M elicited the most pronounced neural-behavioral adaptations. These findings suggest that increasingly structured neural dynamics facilitate adaptive motor execution. Our dual-domain RQA framework offers a powerful tool to quantify learning efficiency and uncover the dynamic coupling between neural reorganization and behavioral adaptation.",

      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

      "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "title": "The time-varying brain: a comprehensive review of dynamic functional connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG",
      "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",
