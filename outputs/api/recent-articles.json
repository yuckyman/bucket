      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Repetition positivity following auditory intensity or frequency changes in young normal-hearing adults",
      "content": "IntroductionGenerative mechanisms of perception such as predictive coding are used to explain how the brain perceives the world; such mechanisms are often experimentally probed using \u201cdeviant\u201d stimuli that violate established patterns (including mismatch negativity), which also elicit responses related to lower-level processes such as stimulus-specific adaptation. However, little is still known about brain responses that indicate the strength of sensory predictions or reinforcement of sensory representations. Repetition positivity (RP) is a positive polarity evoked potential that gradually increases with each repetition of a stimulus, and is thought to reflect progressive strengthening of auditory sensory memory and/or habituation to repetitive stimuli. The aim of this study was to compare RP that follows a change in stimulus frequency with that following a change in stimulus intensity, the latter having not previously been studied.MethodsWe used roving sequences of isochronous 5 kHz pure tones (300 ms duration, 300ms inter-stimulus interval), which changed in frequency by 1 kHz (Experiment 1) or in intensity by 12 dB (Experiment 2) after every 30 stimuli. All changes were roving, such that an increase would be followed by a decrease, and vice versa.ResultsEvent-related potentials recorded with EEG indicated that frequency changes in either direction were followed by RP, whilst only intensity increases were followed by RP, and only a weak visual trend toward RP was apparent for intensity decreases. Observed RP was best explained by a logarithmic function over successive stimuli.ConclusionsRP robustly follows increases, but not necessarily decreases, in stimulus intensity, which appears smaller in amplitude than that elicited by similarly salient frequency changes, and reaches a plateau sooner. These observations offer insight into how intensity is processed similarly yet differently to other sensory attributes in an adaptive or predictive coding framework, and might have future utility in the study of clinical conditions related to aberrant predictive mechanisms.",

      "title": "Peripheral and central auditory dysfunction, cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study",
      "content": "ObjectivesBoth age-related peripheral or central hearing loss, and cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), which are independent association with global and domain-specific cognitive impairment, are common among older adults. Cardiometabolic diseases also are independent risk factors of age-related hearing loss. The first aim of the study was to investigate the independent and joint influence of CMM and low- and high-frequency hearing loss or central auditory processing dysfunction (CAPD) on global and domain-specific cognitive impairment. The second aim was to investigate whether CMM mediate the effects of age-related hearing loss on cognitive performance.MethodsIn total, 508 eligible community-dwelling dementia-free older adult participants agreed to participate and completed a cross-sectional investigation. The averages of thresholds at 0.5, 1, and 2\u202fkHz for low frequency (LPTA) and at 4, 6, and 8\u202fkHz for high frequency (HPTA) were calculated. CAPD was assessed using SNR (signal-to-noise ratio threshold) in a words-in-noise test. Global and domain-specific cognitive performance was measured using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. This study analyzed the independent associations between LPTA, HPTA, CAPD, or CMM and global and domain-specific cognitive performance after adjusting for each other and other confounders. Weighted logistic regression were used to assess the joint effects of CMM and the LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD on cognitive performance. The R package \u201cMediation\u201d was used to examine whether CMM mediated the associations between LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD and cognitive performance.ResultsCMM was independently associated with global cognitive performance in pre-MCI [\u03b2 (95% CI): 0.124 (0.047, 0.202), adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0068], MCI groups [0.131 (0.055, 0.206), adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.068] for total sample, and the sensitivity test (adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0506, and 0.012, respectively) after adjusted for all confounders. CMM in Model 2 was also significantly associated with executive function in the sensitivity test (\u03b2, 0.087; 95% CI, 0.028, 0.145; adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.035). The SNR value and global cognition in Model 2 was significantly associated between the cognitively normal group and the MCI group (adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.044 in total sample, and p\u202f=\u202f0.051 in sensitivity test). HPTA in Model 2 remained independently associated with attention/executive function in the sensitivity test (\u03b2, 0.005; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.008; adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0395). The dose\u2013response relationships between the LPTA, HPTA, or SNR and CMM on global cognition were most significant in the cognitively normal group than in the MCI group. The significant joint effect of CMM and HPTA on executive function also been observed. In the sensitivity test, the indirect mediation effect of HPTA on global cognitive performance in the MCI group vs. the cognitively normal group after adjustments for all confounders through CMM were significant. Approximately 16.172% of the total effect of HPTA on global cognition was explained by the mediation effect through CMM.ConclusionCMM and CAPD were significantly associated with global cognition. CMM and HPTA were significantly associated executive function in the sensitivity test. CMM, and LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD had jointly effects on global cognition. CMM and HPTA had significant joint effect on executive function. CMM might mediate the association between the HPTA and global or executive function in individuals with LPTA \u2264 40\u202fdB HL. These findings indicated that an integrated interventional approach for presbycusis and CMM simultaneously may delay cognitive decline in older adults.",
