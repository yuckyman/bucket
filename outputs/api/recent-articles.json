      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

The aim of this planned project is to investigate the optimal electrode placement and polarity of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to reduce cognitive deficits and substance craving in individuals with SUDs, thereby contributing to improved treatment outcomes, including longer abstinence periods and reduced substance use after...",

      "content": "The ability to accurately perceive one's own bodily signals, such as the heartbeat, plays a vital role in physical and mental health. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this ability, termed interoception, are not fully understood. Converging evidence suggests that cardiac rhythms are linked to frontal brain activity, particularly oscillations in the delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) band, but their causal relationship remained elusive. Here, we identified a frontal network of delta...",

The variations in the results could be attributed to differences in the stimulus parameters. This study aimed to examine the impact of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with different intensities on pain empathy through event-related potentials (ERPs). Thirty-nine participants were recruited for the experiment, and a parallel control design was...",
