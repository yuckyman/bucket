      "content": "Large-scale Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/GPT-4, have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of general domain tasks. Yet, when applied directly to specialized domains like medical imaging, which require in-depth expertise, these models face notable challenges arising from the medical field's inherent complexities and unique characteristics. In this review, we delve into the potential applications of AGI models in medical imaging and healthcare, with a primary focus on LLMs, Large Vision Models, and Large Multimodal Models. We provide a thorough overview of the key features and enabling techniques of LLMs and AGI, and further examine the roadmaps guiding the evolution and implementation of AGI models in the medical sector, summarizing their present applications, potentialities, and associated challenges. In addition, we highlight potential future research directions, offering a holistic view on upcoming ventures. This comprehensive review aims to offer insights into the future implications of AGI in medical imaging, healthcare, and beyond.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "A cytosolic function of DNMT1 controls neuronal morphogenesis via microtubule regulation",
      "content": "Proteins traditionally confined to a single cellular compartment are increasingly recognized to exert non-canonical functions in alternative domains. The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1/STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Affective disorders, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD), exhibit significant mood abnormalities, making rapid diagnosis essential for social stability and healthcare efficiency. Traditional diagnostic solutions, including medical history collection and psychological assessments, often struggle to differentiate their similar clinical presentations, leading to time-consuming, laborious, and a high rate of misdiagnosis. Here, we propose Emoface, an AI-assisted...",

      "content": "Decoding electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of key importance in the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals requires user-specific calibration, which can be time-consuming and limit the application of deep learning approaches, due to general need of large amount of data to properly train these models. In this context, this paper proposes a multidimensional and explainable deep learning framework for fast and...",

      "content": "Age-related decline in motor control, manifesting as impaired posture, gait, and slowed movement execution, significantly diminishes the quality of life in older adults. These functional deficits are associated with alterations in neurophysiological data, which are analyzed using advanced techniques including spectral analysis, complexity measures, and functional connectivity network analysis. These methodologies provide valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning...",
