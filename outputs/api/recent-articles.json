      "title": "Towards Ecologically Valid LLM Benchmarks: Understanding and Designing Domain-Centered Evaluations for Journalism Practitioners",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05501v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Benchmarks play a significant role in how researchers and the public understand generative AI systems. However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals. Our workshop findings surface specific challenges that inform benchmark design opportunities, which we instantiate in a case study that addresses underlying criticisms and specific domain concerns. Through our findings and design case study, this work provides design guidance for developing benchmarks that are better tuned to specific domains.",

      "title": "AI-Enhanced High-Density NIRS Patch for Real-Time Brain Layer Oxygenation Monitoring in Neurological Emergencies",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05612v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.",

To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.05548v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current neuroimaging studies on neurodegenerative diseases and psychological risk factors have been developed predominantly in non Hispanic White cohorts, with other populations markedly underrepresented. In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.",

      "title": "ConnectomeBench: Can LLMs Proofread the Connectome?",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05542v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.05536v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity",

      "title": "Selection and Stability of Functional Connectivity Features for Classification of Brain Disorders",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.05520v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this study, we propose the use of persistent homology- specifically Betti curves for brain age prediction and for distinguishing between healthy and pathological aging. The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.05517v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\\tau \\subsetneq \\sigma$ for which $|\\tau| = i$ and $|\\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.05505v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "title": "A correlation-based tool for quantifying membrane periodic skeleton associated periodicity",
      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",
