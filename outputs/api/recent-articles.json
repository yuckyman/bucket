      "title": "Riemannian Diffusion Kernel-smoothed Continuous Structural Connectivity On Cortical Surface",
      "content": "Atlas-free continuous structural connectivity has garnered increasing attention due to the limitations of atlas-based approaches, including the arbitrary selection of brain atlases and potential information loss. Typically, continuous structural connectivity is represented by a probability density function, with kernel density estimation as a common estimation method. However, constructing an appropriate kernel function on the cortical surface poses significant challenges. Current methods often inflate the cortical surface into a sphere and apply the spherical heat kernel, introducing distortions to density estimation. In this study, we propose a novel approach using the Riemannian diffusion kernel derived from the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the cortical surface to smooth streamline endpoints into a continuous density. Our method inherently accounts for the complex geometry of the cortical surface and exhibits computational efficiency, even with dense tractography datasets. Additionally, we investigate the number of streamlines or fiber tracts required to achieve a reliable continuous representation of structural connectivity. Through simulations and analyses of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we demonstrate the potential of the Riemannian diffusion kernel in enhancing the estimation and analysis of continuous structural connectivity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Electrotactile Stimulation Parameters for Responses Under Cognitive Load",
      "content": "Background: Prosthetic users mainly rely on their vision for feedback during control of the device in absence of the tactile and proprioceptive modalities. Overreliance on vision increases cognitive load during prosthesis use, resulting in reduced control performance. Provision of additional feedback through other modalities could reduce this overreliance on vision and improve closed-loop prosthetic control. Fast and accurate recognition of feedback is particularly important when we consider that both delays and inaccuracies can destabilize closed-loop control environments. Transcutaneous electrotactile stimulation is a promising technology with advantages including non-invasiveness and simplicity. It is not yet clear, however, which parameters influence the speed and accuracy of response to electrotactile stimuli. In this study, we set out to investigate how we can influence response characteristics to an instantaneous change in stimulation intensity by manipulating both stimulus-related and environmental variables. Methods: 20 participants completed a randomized reaction time test to both visual and electrotactile stimulation. Participants were asked to respond to incoming stimuli with a button press on a controller as fast as possible, without discriminating between modality of stimulation. In a second experiment, 20 participants completed an intensity discrimination task for electrotactile stimulation. Participants had to prioritize either speed or accuracy during specific blocks, while cognitive load, magnitude of intensity shift and direction of shift were manipulated. Results: The results of the reaction time experiment confirmed lower average response times for electrotactile stimuli compared to visual stimuli by a median of ~50ms (p=0.008). In the intensity discrimination experiment, increased shift intensities led to increased response accuracies and decreased response times (p<0.001 in both cases). The presence of cognitive load increased average response times (p=0.005), but did not affect response accuracies (p=0.420). Conclusions: The results of the intensity discrimination experiment imply that the magnitude of intensity shift needs to be provided via steps multiple times larger than the just noticeable difference to ensure fast and accurate responses to electrotactile stimulation. Moreover, results from the reaction time experiment confirmed faster average response times for electrotactile stimuli over visual stimuli. We argue that providing electrotactile stimulation using bigger steps in perceived intensity could result in the supplementary feedback making closed-loop control of prosthetic devices more reliable.",

      "title": "Efficient Working Memory Maintenance via High-Dimensional Rotational Dynamics",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) is fundamental to higher-order cognition, yet the circuit mechanisms through which memoranda are maintained in neural activity after removal of sensory input remain subject to vigorous debate. Prominent theories propose that stimuli are encoded in either stable and persistent activity patterns configured through attractor mechanisms or dynamic and time-varying activity patterns brought about through functionally-feedforward network architectures. However, cortical circuits exhibit heterogeneous responses during WM tasks that are challenging to reconcile with either hypothesis. We hypothesised that these complex response dynamics could emerge from an optimally noise-robust and energetically efficient solution to WM tasks. We show that, in contrast to previous theories, networks optimised for efficient WM encoding exhibit high-dimensional rotational dynamics. We find direct evidence for these rotational dynamics in large-scale recordings from monkey prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the complex and dynamic response properties of WM circuits emerge from efficient coding principles.",

      "title": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates Resting Brain Hemodynamics and Autonomic Function: A Multimodal fNIRS-HRV Study",
      "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that can influence brain activity and physiological function. We conducted a sham-controlled multimodal study to examine the effects of low-intensity (0.375 mA) bifrontal tDCS at rest in healthy adult males. The tDCS, with the anode placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cathode over the right DLPFC, was applied for twelve minutes, and outcomes were measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for cortical hemodynamics and connectivity, heart rate variability (HRV), photoplethysmography (PPG) for autonomic function, and subjective surveys for emotional stress. The results showed that, compared to sham, active tDCS produced a decrease in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration in the left DLPFC during stimulation, indicating reduced cortical oxygenation in the stimulated region. Functional connectivity analysis of fNIRS signals further revealed altered network connectivity, including modulation of intra- and inter-frontal connections, in the tDCS condition relative to sham. Concurrently, tDCS induced an increase in HRV indices such as RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, SD1 and SD2, reflecting enhanced parasympathetic activity and autonomic regulation. Participants in the active tDCS group also reported selective reductions in both state and trait anger after stimulation, whereas the sham group showed minimal changes in mood. These findings demonstrate that even at a subthreshold intensity, bifrontal tDCS at rest engaged neurovascular and neurovisceral mechanisms, coupling changes in prefrontal cortical activity with autonomic outflow and mood. This study provides new evidence of cortical-autonomic coupling during neuromodulation and suggests that low-intensity frontal tDCS may promote a calm physiological and emotional state. The results have implications for future research on brain stimulation in emotion regulation and for developing neuromodulation-based interventions to improve autonomic balance and mood in both healthy individuals and clinical populations.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",
