      "title": "Activity-dependent control of axonal amphisome trafficking governs norepinephrine release in vivo",
      "content": "The postmitotic nature, exceptional longevity, and elaborate cytoarchitecture of neurons exert extraordinary demands on proteostasis and autophagy regulation. Amphisomes are organelles of the autophagy pathway that result from the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes. Previous work suggests that neuronal amphisomes also serve as signalling platforms, though their physiological relevance in vivo remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate dynamic trafficking of amphisomes within the long-range, highly branched axons of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) neurons. Using in vivo photoconversion, we show that amphisomes originating in distal axons can traverse the entire axonal length to reach the soma. Two-photon imaging of LC-NE projections to the prefrontal cortex revealed that velocity and directionality of trafficking are tightly regulated by LC activity states, behavioural context, and autocrine norepinephrine signalling. Activation of Gi-coupled receptor signalling unifies directionality of transport, enhances somatic cargo delivery, whereas prolonged distal immobilization correlates with increased norepinephrine release, consistent with a signalling function. Together, these findings establish LC amphisomes as dual-function organelles that integrate degradative transport with activity-dependent signalling in vivo.",

      "title": "Quantifying Rhythmic and Arrhythmic Components of Brain Activity",
      "content": "Brain activity comprises both rhythmic (periodic) and arrhythmic (aperiodic) components. These signal elements vary across healthy aging, and disease, and may make distinct contributions to conscious perception. Despite pioneering techniques to parameterize rhythmic and arrhythmic neural components based on power spectra, the methodology for quantifying rhythmic activity remains in its infancy. Variation in analytical choices for isolating brain rhythms from background arrhythmic activity makes interpreting findings across studies difficult. Whether current approaches can accurately recover the independent contribution of these neural signal elements remains to be established. Here, using simulation and parameter recovery approaches, we show that standard analytic methods for quantifying rhythmic activity conflate these two neurophysiological components, yielding spurious correlations between spectral model parameters. We propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations and demonstrate effective separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in simulated neural time series. We validate these methods using resting-state recordings from a large cohort. Our recommendations for spectral parameterization enable the robust independent quantification of rhythmic and arrhythmic signal components for cognitive neuroscience.",

      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",
