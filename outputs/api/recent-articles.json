      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has shown therapeutic potential for ischemic stroke, but the neural oscillatory mechanisms of its therapeutic effects remain incompletely elucidated. Based on the rat model and clinical stroke patients, this paper combines multiple indicators such as electroencephalography (EEG) relative power (RP), Lempel-Ziv complexity and sample entropy to investigate the mechanism by which tDCS modulates neural oscillations in ischemic stroke. The results indicated that tDCS substantially reduced the RP of the \u03b4 frequency band, enhanced the normal oscillation of the \u03b1 frequency band, and improved the complexity index of the EEG signals. These findings suggest that tDCS could facilitate the recovery following ischemic stroke through the modulation of EEG rhythms.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "VCAP-102 Achieves Exceptional BBB Penetration in Marmosets After Ten Years of AAV Capsid Evaluation",
      "content": "Efficient passage of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for achieving broad central nervous system transduction following systemic delivery. Since PHP.B was reported in 2016 to exhibit high BBB permeability in C57BL/6J mice, many BBB-penetrant capsids have been developed, yet their performance often varies substantially across species. From 2016 to 2025, we produced each newly reported BBB-penetrant capsid as its sequence became available and evaluated it under standardized intravenous administration conditions in marmosets. This included PHP.B, PHP.eB, AAV-F, CAP-B22, CAP-B10, CPP.16, CAP-Mac, and BR1N. Although several of these capsids have been reported to penetrate the marmoset BBB, none reproduced these effects under our unified evaluation conditions. We also pursued several directed-evolution approaches to engineer AAV9-based variants with improved BBB permeability; however, none surpassed AAV9. In 2025, VCAP-102 was reported as an AAV9-derived capsid with BBB permeability in mice and non-human primates. When evaluated using our standardized framework, VCAP-102 consistently mediated markedly stronger and more widespread whole-brain transduction than AAV9 across all three animals tested. These findings provide a decade-long, systematic assessment of BBB-penetrant AAV capsids in marmosets and identify VCAP-102 as a highly promising candidate for future systemically delivered AAV-based gene therapies.",

      "title": "Stress Coping Style Alters Functional Brain Network Activity to Acute Stressor",
      "content": "Consistent individual differences in behavior (e.g., personality types, stress coping styles) are a common occurrence across animal taxa. One hypothesis poses that the resulting constraints for within-individual behavioral variation may also lead to constraints for the evolution of behavior. With stress coping styles seen across taxa, it suggests a common underlying proximate mechanism. In this study we investigated neural activity patterns across the brain by quantifying immediate early gene expression in individuals with alternative stress coping styles in response to an acute stressor in zebrafish (Danio rerio). While immediate early gene expression levels of individual brain regions in the aversive brain network were similar across groups, functional network activity differed. There were several differences across groups including interactions between the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal homologs. One brain area that had many different connections across groups was the central gray. There were many differences involving central gray activity between proactive and reactive fish at baseline suggesting that baseline activity may prime for the reaction to stress. Collectively, baseline brain activity can predict behaviors, suggesting that these differences in brain interactions at baseline may be important for biasing behavioral responses to stressors that characterizes a stress coping style.",

      "title": "Multiscale characterisation of the human claustrum from histology to MRI",
      "content": "Though linked to an unusually broad array of functions, the human claustrum's complex morphology has hindered in vivo study, resulting in a small MRI literature marked by implausibly large discrepancies in reported characteristics. We constructed the first three-dimensional histological \"gold standard\" claustrum model, and systematically evaluated in vivo 7-Tesla MRI datasets against it and downsampled derivatives. MRI showed resolution-dependent differences rather than contrast limitations, transforming the claustrum's intricate sheet into an artefactually thickened ribbon. However, submillimetre MRI reliably recovered the dorsal \"core\" that contains most claustral volume and density and houses major corticoclaustral connectivity. At 0.5mm resolution, extension into the temporal lobe, including irregular ventral \"puddles\", was partially recovered, with uncertainty reflecting boundary imprecision rather than anatomical loss. Our results refute the view that the claustrum is inaccessible in the living human brain, define practical measurement limits, and provide a foundation for future functional investigations.",

      "title": "Tissue-to-Bytes: A Catalytic Digital Twin Platform for Consortium-Scale Integration of Single-Cell Omics Data in BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network",
      "content": "The NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and data scientists to create reference brain cell atlases to be used by the research community as a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of human brain function and disorders. Coordinated sharing and management of the scarce human brain tissue, across lifespans and among the eleven participating BICAN centers and laboratories with anatomical precision, is a formidable undertaking. Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIPM provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone. The NIMP digital twin paradigm not only serves BICAN; it provides a blueprint for future-proof data coordination at consortium scale.",

      "content": "While Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically triggers cognitive decline, some individuals with significant AD pathology maintain normal cognition into late life. Understanding the neuronal underpinnings of such cognitive resilience would propel the development of interventions for delaying dementia. To this end, we used cognitive testing to identify a subset of cognitively resilient 13-month-old TgF344-AD rats (established AD) and their non-transgenic littermates, followed by Neuropixels recording from 8500 neurons during repeated somatosensory stimulation. Cognitively resilient TgF344-AD rats recruited fewer neurons yet displayed more stable neuronal representations during repeated stimulations in cortical excitatory and hippocampal inhibitory ensembles, with reduced excitatory spike burstiness during network activation and a distinct pattern of functional synaptic connectivity. These associations existed independently of amyloid and tau levels. For the first time, our study revealed neuronal population-level hallmarks of maintained cognition that may serve as a novel neurophysiological biomarker of cognitive resilience and a target for stabilizing cognition.",

      "title": "Genetic Targeting and Conductance-Based Modeling Reveal Novel Diversity Within Mouse Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons",
      "content": "Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit auditory signals from the cochlea to the brain and are divided into two main types: type I and type II, distinguished by their anatomy and connectivity. However, the function of type II SGNs remains poorly understood due to their scarcity and lack of clear physiological markers. In this study, we use two Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter mouse lines to enhance the identification and targeting of type II SGNs for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We reveal a set of distinguishing biophysical features, most notably, the presence of an inactivating potassium current and weaker voltage-gated sodium currents, that clearly separate type II SGNs from their type I counterparts. Additionally, we uncover greater-than-expected heterogeneity among type II SGNs, including variation in size, excitability, and ion channel expression. These features suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of type II SGNs, with potential differences in function. We find that most type II SGNs are relatively inexcitable and incapable of sustained firing. Instead, they appear to be better suited to integrating sustained signals, potentially supporting roles in detecting cochlear damage or modulating efferent feedback. Additionally, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that removing the inactivation component of the inactivating potassium current specific to type II SGNs allowed repetitive spiking to similar levels seen in type I SGNs, suggesting a crucial role for the current in stifling type II SGN activity. Together, our findings define biophysical signatures that distinguish SGN types and subtypes, offering new insight into their contributions to normal hearing and cochlear pathology.",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "Attentional responses to the color exposure sequence of landscape paintings: evidence from fNIRS and eye-tracking",
      "content": "IntroductionColor is a critical determinant of esthetic experience, shaping both immersion and cognitive responses. However, the extent to which the sequence of color exposure modulates the interplay between neural activation and ocular behavior remains insufficiently understood.MethodsTen chromatic landscape paintings were collected and converted into achromatic versions, yielding a total of 20 visual stimuli. Participants were assigned to two conditions: Condition A (achromatic to chromatic) and Condition B (chromatic to achromatic). Visual attention and prefrontal activation were assessed using eye-tracking techniques and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.ResultsAnalyses revealed significantly greater neural activation in Condition A within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.006), left orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043), and right orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043). Eye-tracking metrics indicated longer Total duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.015), Maximum duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.036), and Total duration of whole fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.025) under Condition A. Subjective evaluations also showed significant differences, with higher ratings for Match (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.005) and Feel (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.029).DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that color stimuli exert a decisive influence not only on subjective immersion but also on objective neurocognitive processes. The study extends the scientific foundation of empirical esthetics and offers novel implications for the design of museum and exhibition environments.",

      "title": "Preliminary ERP evidence of the impact of loneliness on Stroop interference for socio-emotional stimuli",
      "content": "Growing evidence highlights the adverse clinical effects and societal implications of loneliness, i.e., the negative feeling associated with a perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social connections. To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",
