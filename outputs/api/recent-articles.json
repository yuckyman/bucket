      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

      "content": "<p>Google just published details about its Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), an open standard aimed at making shopping work natively with AI agents instead of websites. The idea is to standardize the entire commerce flow\u2014product discovery, pricing, checkout, payment, and post-purchase\u2014so an AI agent can complete purchases directly without custom integrations for every merchant. Merchants remain the seller of record, but expose capabilities through a common protocol, letting agents compare options and execute checkout across many stores. If this takes off, it weakens marketplace lock-in (including Amazon\u2019s) by shifting discovery and checkout out of proprietary UIs and into AI-driven intent flows, similar to how open web protocols reduced the power of early internet portals.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586413\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586413</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "Alterations of brain network topology and structural-functional connectivity coupling in noise-induced hearing loss based on macroscopic scale",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the changes in the global attributes of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) graph theory, as well as the coupling topological structure of the whole brain SC-FC in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).Methods57 NIHL patients and 55 health controls (HCs) were included; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, clinical data (scales, laboratory indicators) were collected. The graph theory network analysis of SC and FC, the whole-brain SC-FC coupling were performed, and a correlation analysis was employed to analyze the results in relation to the clinical data.ResultsFor FC, there was no significant difference in the global indices directly between groups (P > 0.05, FDR corrected). For SC, the normalized clustering coefficient (\u03b3) and small-worldness (\u03c3) of the NIHL were higher than those of the HCs (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). There was no significant difference in the SC-FC coupling strength of whole brain between two groups (P > 0.05). The graph attribute indices and coupling values of NIHL were correlated to varying degrees with the results of anxiety scale, coagulation, inflammation and biochemical indices (P < 0.05).ConclusionThe brain network topology structure of NIHL patients is abnormal, but the SC-FC coupling strength does not change significantly. This may provide a basis for understanding the theoretical mechanism of brain neural function remodeling and for future more detailed and diverse studies.",
