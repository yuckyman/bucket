      "title": "Mesa 3.4.0: Agent-based modeling; now with universal time tracking and improved reproducibility!",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! Mesa 3.4.0 is here with major improvements to time tracking, batch run reproducibility, and a strengthened deprecation policy. We've also migrated to our new mesa organization on GitHub and now require Python 3.12+. This release includes numerous visualization enhancements, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0\"><strong>https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0</strong></a></li> </ul> <h1>What's Agent-Based Modeling?</h1> <p>Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual &quot;agents&quot; (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.</p> <h1>What's Mesa?</h1> <p>Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.</p> <h1>What's new in Mesa 3.4.0?</h1> <h1>Universal simulation time with model.time</h1> <p>Mesa now provides a single source of truth for simulation time through the <code>model.time</code> attribute. Previously, time was fragmented across different components - simple models used <code>model.steps</code> as a proxy, while discrete event simulations stored time in <code>simulator.time</code>. Now all models have a consistent <code>model.time</code> attribute that automatically increments with each step and works seamlessly with discrete event simulators.</p> <p>It also allows us to simplify our data collection and experimentation control in future releases, and better integrate it with our full discrete-event simulation.</p> <h1>Improved batch run reproducibility</h1> <p>The <code>batch_run</code> function now offers explicit control over random seeds across replications through the new <code>rng</code> parameter. Previously, using <code>iterations</code> with a fixed seed caused all iterations to use identical seeds, producing duplicate results instead of independent replications. The new approach gives you complete control over reproducibility by accepting either a single seed value or an iterable of seed values.</p> <h1>Other improvements</h1> <p>This release includes significant visualization enhancements (support for <code>AgentPortrayalStyle</code> in Altair components, improved property layer styling), a strengthened deprecation policy with formal guarantees, removal of the experimental cell space module in favor of the stable <code>mesa.discrete_space</code> module, and numerous bug fixes.</p> <p>We welcome 10 new contributors to the Mesa project in this release! Thank you to everyone who contributed bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature enhancements.</p> <h1>Mesa 4</h1> <p>We're already planning the future with Mesa 4.0, and focusing on two key areas: <strong>Fundamentals</strong> (unified time and event scheduling, coherent spatial modeling, clean-sheet experimentation and data collection, stable visualization) and <strong>Extendability</strong> (powerful agent behavior frameworks, ML/RL/AI integration, and an extensible module system). We aim to make Mesa not just a toolkit but a comprehensive platform where researchers can model complex systems as naturally as they think about them.

As an input it accepts SMILES notation. Chemical syntax validity is enforced during training and inference using SELFIES encoding. I also made an optional GUI to interact with the model using NiceGUI.</p> <p>Currently, it might seem like a glorified substructure search, however it is able to generate molecules which may not actually exist (yet?) while respecting chemical syntax and including the input structure in the generated structure. I have listed some possible use-cases and further improvements in the github README.</p> <h1>Target audience</h1> <ul> <li>People who find it intriguing to generate random, cool, possibly unsynthesisable molecules.</li> <li>Chemists</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I have not found many projects which uses a GRU and have a GUI to interact with the model. Transformers, LSTM are likely better for such uses-cases but may require more data and computational resources, and many projects exist which have demonstrated their capabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thecrypticcode\"> /u/thecrypticcode </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.
