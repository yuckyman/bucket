      "title": "Neural Dynamics of Multiattribute Decision Making Under Choice Overload",
      "content": "The present study examines the neural mechanisms of value-based multiattribute decision making through the lens of choice overload during consumer choice. Two behavioral experiments established that choice sets of a moderate size with nine options were perceived as most optimal compared to choice sets with three and 24 options, and options chosen from the largest set size were judged to be the least satisfying. A functional MRI study then examined how the brain responds to choice sets varying in size and complexity by manipulating the number of options presented as well as the presence of asymmetrically dominated decoy alternatives during a simulated online shopping task. Results showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity followed an inverse U-shape as a function of choice set size, peaking for moderately sized choice sets. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) exhibited a linear trend with choice set size. Trials containing decoy options elicited greater activation of the anterior insula (AIns) and DLPFC. Computational modeling of choice behavior revealed a greater tendency to utilize a simplifying lexicographic decision strategy as decision difficulty increased, and individual differences in decision strategies were reflected in activity of the ACC and AIns. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates effort, control, and strategy during complex value-based decisions.",

      "title": "CUSP: Complex Spike Sorting from Multi-electrode Array Recordings with U-net Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction",
      "content": "Background: Complex spikes (CSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells convey unique signals complementary to Simple spike (SS) action potentials, but are infrequent and variable in waveform. Their variability and low spike counts, combined with recording artifacts such as electrode drift, make automated detection challenging. New Method: We introduce CUSP (CS sorting via U-net Sequence Prediction), a fully automated deep learning framework for CS sorting in high-density multi-electrode array recordings. CUSP uses a U-Net architecture with hybrid self-attention inception blocks to integrate local field potential and action potential signals and outputs CS event probabilities in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Detected events are clustered and paired with concurrently detected SSs to reconstruct the complete Purkinje cell activity. Results: Trained on cerebellar neuropixels recordings in rhesus macaques, CUSP achieves human-expert performance (F1 = 0.83 +/- 0.03) and even captures valid CS events overlooked during manual annotation. Comparison with Existing Methods: CUSP outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art CS and SS sorting algorithms on CS detection. It remains robust to waveform variability, spikelet composition, and electrode drift, enabling accurate CS tracking in long-term recordings. In contrast, existing methods often show false-positive biases or degrade under drift. Conclusions: CUSP provides a scalable, robust framework for analyzing burst-like or dynamically complex spike patterns. Its generalizability makes it valuable for large-scale cerebellar datasets and other neural systems, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells, where complex bursts are critical for computation. By combining expert-level accuracy with automation, CUSP offers a broadly applicable solution for studying information coding across circuits.",

      "title": "A dopamine circuit regulates locomotor initiation and persistence in Drosophila",
      "content": "Decisions to initiate or terminate locomotion reflect the commitment of an animal to expend energy and thus must be appropriately regulated. Dopaminergic system has been implicated in locomotor regulation but how it controls these decisions remains unclear. Here we show that a dopamine circuit in Drosophila mushroom body regulates cue-induced locomotor initiation and termination by integrating locomotor history and current motivation. This circuit consists of the locomotor-initiator mushroom body output neurons, MBON09, and the locomotor-terminator MBON21. Previous locomotor initiation by default suppresses the propensity of future initiation through depression of MBON09 activity by locomotion-sensitive dopamine afferents, preventing redundant action. Locomotor persistence is promoted through combined inhibition of MBON21 by MBON09 and by distinct dopamine afferents that receive fluctuating motivational signals. Persistent locomotion under high motivational state, in turn, causes dopamine-dependent MBON09 facilitation, reinvigorating locomotor initiation program. Our results revealed a dopaminergic mechanism to transform recent behavior and current motivation into a moment-by-moment internal state that in turn regulates locomotor decisions.",

      "title": "Separable neurocomputational mechanisms underlying multisensory learning",
      "content": "Efficient control of behavior requires multisensory learning from information distributed across senses. However, most neurocomputational studies have focused on unisensory signals. Here, we identify distinct but interacting neurocomputational mechanisms that support learning of multisensory associations. We designed a task in which behaviorally relevant information was available only from combinations of visual cues with either auditory or tactile cues. In 58 participants undergoing fMRI, we dissociated three processes: multisensory statistical learning (SL), modeled as stimulus-locked Shannon surprise; reinforcement learning (RL), modeled as feedback-locked signed reward prediction errors (RPEs); and feedback-locked unsigned RPEs (uRPEs), reflecting surprise about reward outcomes. Behaviorally, response times scaled with Shannon surprise (SL) while accuracy improved with feedback (RL). Model-based fMRI revealed dissociable but complementary networks: RPEs engaged ventral striatum, vmPFC, and left angular gyrus; surprise recruited bilateral angular gyrus, dlPFC, and precuneus; and uRPEs involved insula, dorsomedial prefrontal, and lateral frontoparietal cortices. Several of these regions are not typically implicated in unisensory studies, suggesting specialization for multisensory learning. All three networks were modality-general, i.e., they showed comparable strength for audiovisual and visuotactile learning. Notably, left angular gyrus tracked both Shannon surprise and RPE, identifying it as a potential hub for integrating structural and value information. These findings reveal that the brain engages distinct but complementary systems for structure-based, reward-based, and outcome-surprise computations. By combining behavioral modeling and fMRI with a novel task design, we provide a principled framework for dissecting the neurocomputational architecture of multisensory learning.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in B2 SINE RNA Expression and its Role in Hippocampal Development",
      "content": "Once dismissed as \"junk\", transposable elements (TE) have recently gained recognition for their regulatory roles, notably in the brain and in development. The brain is hormone-responsive and the hippocampus in particular is sensitive to circulating gonadal hormones. While transcriptionally active, TE function remains poorly understood, especially in the brain. We and others have shown that one particular TE RNA, B2 SINE ncRNA, is a regulator in the rodent hippocampus, especially after a psychologically stressful event like acute restraint stress. It is unknown, however, if B2 SINE ncRNA is necessary for the proper development of hippocampal neurons, and furthermore, if there is a sex difference in this development. This work investigates the difference in expression of B2 SINE RNA across sexes and its role in the development of primary hippocampal neurons. We utilized pooled locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs to knock down the expression of B2 SINE RNA and treated primary hippocampal neurons with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test if there is a difference in dendritic complexity. We used Sholl analysis to quantify the branching, number of tips, and Sholl mean. We found a sex difference in both B2 SINE, higher in males compared to females, and B-actin, lower in males compared to females. Additionally, knocking down B2 SINE RNA results in a reduction of dendritic complexity in male but not in female neurons. Taken together, this work suggests that B2 SINE RNA is expressed differentially and plays an important role in the proper development of hippocampal neurons in a sex dependent manner. Our findings support the identification of a sex-specific biomarker that may enable individualized treatment of conditions influenced by sex. This is the first evidence of the role a transposable element's RNA has in the regulation of the development of neurons and the first to show that differential regulation by sex.",

      "title": "Machine-Learning Classification of Motor Unit Types in the Adult Mouse",
      "content": "The diversity of motor units arises from differences in the contractile properties of muscle fibers and the intrinsic electrical properties of their motoneurons. In mice, however, this relationship has not been quantitatively defined, and conventional classification often relies on subjective thresholds. Here, we combined in vivo intracellular recordings with supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods to test whether motoneuron electrophysiology can predict the physiological identity of mouse motor units. Unbiased clustering identified four groups corresponding to slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), intermediate (FI), and fast fatigable (FF) types. A multinomial logistic regression model performed well, with most errors occurring between FI and FF types, which showed substantial overlap. Reducing the task to three classes improved accuracy. Feature selection revealed that four electrophysiological properties (input conductance, rheobase, AHP duration, maximal frequency) were sufficient for high predictive performance. Overall, this study provides a quantitative description of mouse motor-unit properties and a framework for incorporating motor-unit diversity into future investigations of neuromuscular physiology and disease.",

      "title": "Perceiving Instability: How Expectations Bias Sensorimotor Processing in Balance Control",
      "content": "Maintaining balance requires rapid integration of sensory input with top-down sensorimotor predictions. Predictive coding frameworks posit that mismatches between the two (prediction errors) drive perceptual inference. Although these frameworks have helped explain perception in unisensory domains (e.g., vision, touch), it remains unclear whether such mechanisms govern perception in fast-acting sensorimotor systems like human balance. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and discrete postural perturbations, we independently manipulated expectations and sensory input by priming healthy adult participants to expect either small or large perturbations, while occasionally delivering expectancy-violating perturbations (i.e., perturbations were smaller or larger than expected). Subjective perception of instability was shaped by expectation alone, regardless of actual sensory input (i.e., perturbation magnitude). Similarly, both anticipatory pre-perturbation beta-band suppression and post-perturbation sensorimotor gamma increases were sensitive to expected perturbation magnitude. In contrast, both the balance N1 (a well-established stimulus-evoked cortical potential) and the objective postural responses of instability tracked actual perturbation magnitude alone. Crucially, neither perception, nor any of these early (commonly analysed) neural or behavioural markers, encoded prediction errors. These findings suggest that two distinct systems exist: one that is sensitive to top-down expectations and another that is driven by sensory input, independent of expectation or mismatches. These findings challenge the centrality of prediction error as a driver of perception in fast sensorimotor systems such as postural control, and offer insight into conditions marked by distorted bodily awareness during balance.",

      "title": "Auditory Cortical Gradients Integrate Bottom-Up and Top-Down Structure During Natural Sound Categorisation",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain organises natural categories is a central challenge in neuroscience. While prior work has shown that categories can be decoded from distributed activity patterns in auditory cortex, it remains unclear how these categories are globally arranged relative to one another, and how low-level acoustic and higher-level semantic structure jointly shape this organisation. Here, we addressed these questions by deriving low-dimensional functional gradients from high-depth functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (three participants, ~4.7 hours each) acquired during a category-specific one-back task. These gradients captured the principal axes of population activity in auditory cortex. Gradient-based models of the auditory cortex explained category structure more accurately than region-of-interest or whole-brain approaches, revealing that category information is distributed across multiple continuous axes rather than aligned with any single organisational dimension. Projecting acoustic (gammatone filter-bank) and behavioural similarity spaces directly into a shared framework with the fMRI functional axes showed that both contribute to the brain's category geometry, with acoustic structure exerting a somewhat stronger influence. However, representational relationships varied across category pairs: some reflected primarily acoustic similarity, others semantic distinctions, and many a combination of both. This pairwise heterogeneity shows how auditory cortex may integrate multiple representational dimensions that define higher-level categories.",

In this study, we leverage mouse models, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, behavioral assays, and bioinformatic approaches to demonstrate that astrocyte activity and astrocyte-mediated mouse behavior depends on the highly conserved and selective RNA turnover pathway-nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). Conditional deletion of the core NMD gene, Upf2, in mature astrocytes leads to enhanced basal Ca2+ signaling coupled with synapse dysfunction and elevated anxiety. Restoring basal Ca2+ signaling in NMD-deficient astrocytes rescued synaptic transmission and minimized anxiety-associated behavior. Molecular bioinformatic analysis identified specific NMD target transcripts in astrocytes as candidates influencing calcium signaling pathways and neuro-glia interactions that support brain function. Our study is the first to demonstrate functional roles for NMD in astrocytes.",

      "title": "Cell-autonomous mitochondrial calcium flux governs oligodendrocyte regeneration",
      "content": "Oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells drive central nervous system remyelination, yet the intrinsic mechanisms that define their regenerative potential remain unclear. We identify spontaneous, cell-autonomous intracellular Ca2+ signaling as a critical mechanism regulating OL regeneration following demyelination. Longitudinal in vivo imaging and ex vivo recordings reveal that Ca2+ signaling arises intrinsically within OL lineage cells after demyelination, and occurs independently from neuronal or behavioral activity. Mechanistically, mitochondrial Ca2+ flux sustains intracellular Ca2+ signals in oligodendroglia, and its in vivo disruption impairs oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, differentiation, and repopulation at the lesion site. Conversely, enhancing oligodendroglial Ca2+ signaling in vivo using chemogenetics stimulates lineage expansion and differentiation. In primary human OPC cultures, modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux similarly reduces proliferation, indicating a conserved role for this pathway across species. These findings identify mitochondrial Ca2+ flux as a central driver of the oligodendroglial regeneration and a potential therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases.",
