      "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
      "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

      "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

      "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
      "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

      "title": "Measurement of Airborne Ultrasound Focus on Skin Surface Using Thermal Imaging",
      "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

      "title": "TexSenseGAN: A User-Guided System for Optimizing Texture-Related Vibrotactile Feedback Using Generative Adversarial Network",
      "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

      "title": "Enhancing Human Navigation Ability Using Force-Feedback From a Lower-Limb Exoskeleton",
      "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

      "title": "Molecular Deconstruction of the Medullary Raphe Magnus in the rat: Transcriptional Responses to Repeated Seizures",
      "content": "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of death in patients with epilepsy and is thought to result from dysfunctional and/or failure of cardiorespiratory control systems. Post-mortem brainstem tissue analyses in human SUDEP cases point to reductions in markers of the brainstem serotonin (5-HT) system, which is known as a brainstem center that provides excitatory neuromodulation. We have previously shown in a knockout rat model (SSkcnj16-/- rats) that repeated seizures led to progressively greater ventilatory inhibition in the post-seizure period, seizure-associated mortality, and reduced brainstem 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) particularly within the Raphe Magnus (RMg). Here, we account for the cellular constituency and local transcriptional responses to repeated seizures in male SSkcnj16-/- rats that experienced daily seizures for 3, 5, 7, or 10 consecutive days using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) from brainstem tissue biopsies including the RMg (-12.12 mm to -10.30 mm caudal to Bregma) two hours post-seizure. Unbiased cluster analysis identified 18 cell major clusters that were by identified by the expression of known gene markers, with most cells being oligodendrocytes. However, local RMg neurons showed the greatest numbers of differentially expressed genes with seizures compared to all other cell types. Further re-clustering of neuronal cell types yielded 14 distinct RMg neuron subpopulations, including 5 types of GABAergic neurons, 2 glutamatergic clusters, and 2 groups of 5-HT neurons which all had unique expression profiles. Nearly all DEGs across neuronal subtypes were increased following seizures, and a large fraction of which were common across seizure days and across neuron type suggesting uniformity in cellular response to seizures in this region. These studies provide foundational information regarding the cellular constituency of the RMg region in the rat, and altered neuronal function following repeated seizures in the absence of changes in other cell types in this key region of cardiorespiratory control.",

      "title": "Temporal Interference Stimulation Can Enhance or Disrupt Human Memory Encoding as a Function of Brain Location and Frequency",
      "content": "Visual memory relies on synchronized interactions and rhythms between the medial temporal lobes and neocortical brain regions. Non-invasive manipulation of memory-related brain regions, specifically deeper temporal lobe regions, has been limited by the lack of precision of non-invasive neuromodulation; when targeting deeper structures, the cortex is always stimulated, never deeper structures in isolation. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation, a novel non-invasive technique, uses high-frequency carrier fields to deliver targeted, physiologically relevant neuromodulation via amplitude-modulated envelopes at specific brain regions. Here, we investigate TI s impact on figure memory encoding in 70 healthy participants using the Rey-Osterrieth and Taylor Complex Figure tasks, with TI applied in several brain regions independently and simultaneously; allowing investigation of combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical brain regions. Interestingly, higher frequency TI envelopes (130 Hz offset) targeting bilateral hippocampi and temporal cortices significantly impair recall (p = 6.54e-04), while lower frequency TI envelopes (5 Hz offset) targeting only the bilateral hippocampi significantly enhance recall (p = 0.0447). Stimulation using other combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical regions showed no effect, underscoring the critical role of frequency and focality of non-invasive brain stimulation and correct target selection. Finally, functional MRI reveals strong differences between the effects of 130 Hz and 5 Hz envelopes, specifically in hippocampal BOLD signals, brain connectivity, default mode, and attentional networks. These findings demonstrate TI s ability to bidirectionally modulate memory encoding through precise frequency and target tuning, offering a powerful tool for cognitive neuroscience and potential therapeutic applications for memory disorders.",

      "title": "Dynamic and context-dependent modulation of proprioceptive input in primate primary motor cortex",
      "content": "During voluntary movement, somatosensory input is attenuated -sensory gating - which may prevent the CNS from being overwhelmed by predictable afferent feedback not essential for motor control. In the cerebral cortex, sensory gating has been demonstrated in primary (S1) and higher-order sensory areas. The primary motor cortex (M1) is the major cortical output relay to the spinal cord and muscles, and proprioceptive feedback is crucial for shaping motor output, much as in S1. However, whether proprioceptive signals to M1 are attenuated during movement, and if so, why, remains unclear. We recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in M1 of two monkeys performing a wrist task while electrically stimulating muscle and cutaneous afferents innervating forearm extensors and adjacent skin. Both local field potentials and single-neuron recordings revealed significant suppression of muscle-evoked SEPs during Active movement and Static hold phases, providing direct evidence that proprioceptive input to M1 is generally gated during motor execution, as previously reported for cutaneous input. Yet, amidst this suppression, SEPs in a subset of M1 neurons were preserved during Static hold, especially those evoked by antagonist muscle afferents. Because monkeys had to maintain precise joint angles for stable posture, these results suggest that proprioceptive signals from antagonist muscles - likely reflecting spindle activity in lengthening muscles - escape attenuation to provide information essential for joint angle control. Overall, our findings demonstrate that while proprioceptive input to M1 is broadly suppressed during motor output, specific afferent signals from antagonist muscles are selectively maintained in a context-dependent manner to support posture control.",

      "title": "Single nucleus multiomic atlas of human dorsal root ganglia reveals the contribution of non-neuronal cell types to pain",
      "content": "Sensory neurons residing in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) transmit sensory information such as pain, itch, touch, pressure and bodily position to the central nervous system. The activity of sensory neurons is regulated by non-neuronal cell types in the DRG, including satellite glial cells (SGCs) and fibroblasts. Dysregulated gene expression in DRG cells contributes to sensory nervous system disorders such as chronic pain and itch. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of these conditions requires dissecting transcriptional regulation in human DRG (hDRG). In this study, we profiled transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes from postmortem hDRG samples at single-cell level. We demonstrate that sequencing depth significantly impacts downstream analysis, with deeper sequencing yielding more detected cells and features, improved data integration, refined clustering and annotation, and more accurate scientific interpretations. We identified nine major cell types, defined their molecular signatures, and mapped cis-regulatory landscapes. Integration of gene expression with chromatin accessibility enabled peak-gene association and transcriptional network analyses, revealing transcription factors, their target genes, and their regulatory elements. This approach uncovered cell types, genes, and cis-regulatory regions potentially driving pain conditions. Our unbiased genome-wide analysis confirmed known pain-related genes and highlighted novel candidates. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms and candidate cell types involved in pain. Importantly, our results demonstrate that non-neuronal cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and SGCs, play critical roles in pain pathogenesis and should be investigated as therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Transmitted alpha-synuclein extracellular vesicles downregulate axonal flux of retrograde carriers in recipient neurons",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a cytosolic protein located in nerve terminals and is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-syn can be transmitted from neuron to neuron via exosomal release, thereby contributing to the propagation of alpha-syn pathology. However, the mechanism by which alpha-syn-containing exosomes perturb the function of recipient neurons is currently unknown. Retrograde axonal transport of carriers emanating from the presynapse is essential for neuronal survival. To determine the effect of transmitted alpha-syn on neuronal retrograde trafficking, we used conditioned medium from alpha-syn transfected donor hippocampal neurons, applied to naive (non-transfected) recipient neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers. Time-lapse imaging of retrograde carriers containing cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was then performed in these recipient neurons. Here, we show that conditioned medium from alpha-synWT-GFP transfected donor neurons significantly downregulated the frequency of retrograde CTB carriers when applied to recipient neurons. This effect was abolished by (i) inhibiting endocytosis in recipient neurons, (ii) blocking exosomal release from donor cells via an Hsp90-dependent mechanism, or (iii) by using conditioned medium from neurons transfected with a Parkinson's mutant (alpha-synA30P-GFP). Whilst transmitted, alpha-synWT-mEos2, alpha-synA30P-mEos2, and mEos2 alone were detected in recipient neurons using single-molecule imaging. Interestingly, alpha-synWT-mEos2 exhibited lower mobility and periodic (190 nm) immobilizations along the axon. Our data suggest that the downregulation of vesicular trafficking by transmitted alpha-syn does not rely on the specific release nor uptake of exosomal alpha-syn but probably depends on its interaction with endogenous alpha-syn following endocytosis in recipient neurons. The transmitted alpha-syn-containing extracellular vesicles therefore control essential axonal trafficking in recipient neurons, an effect lost with the Parkinson's disease mutant alpha-synA30P.",
