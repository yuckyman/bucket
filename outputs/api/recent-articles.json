However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "title": "Optimal configuration of on-scalp OPMs with fixed channel counts",
      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: These results provide vital insights for technology developers about the perceived utility of smartphone apps for people with low vision or blindness during navigation. Our results highlight the importance of built-in accessibility features for users with visual impairments. As additional technology-based solutions are developed, it is essential that blind and low vision users, including rehabilitation professionals, are meaningfully included within design.",
