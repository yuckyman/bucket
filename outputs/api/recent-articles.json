      "title": "Feasibility of decoding cerebellar movement-related potentials for brain-computer interface applications",
      "content": "Objective. In brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, signals are conventionally acquired from the cerebrum, and only a subset of the complex interactions that occur in several areas of the brain are collected. One area that has not been investigated for BCI application is the cerebellum, despite its involvement in movement and executive function. The present study aimed to determine the features of movement-related cerebellar electrocerebellography (ECeG) that are most useful for decoding, and how performance compares with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cerebrum. Approach. ECeG and EEG data were collected from six healthy adults to identify useful movement-related features from both cerebrum and cerebellum. Electromyography was used to capture the movements from the muscles. Decoding was conducted in binary movement vs. rest and movement vs. movement systems using support vector machines. Decoding performance was compared between cerebral, cerebellar, a combination of both, and temporal groups. Re-referencing techniques were applied to compensate for possible common reference artefacts or volume conduction effects. Main results. Movement-related features were decoded from over the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Classification accuracies were similar in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, when classifying movement vs. rest (cerebrum: 0.78 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and movement vs. movement states (cerebrum: 0.76 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.71 \u00b1 0.02). The delta band (1\u20133 Hz) was the most useful feature for decoding. Significance. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ECeG is a feasible source of movement related signals for implementing a BCI. The present study also demonstrated that the ECeG closely resembled the EEG signals and represents an alternate approach for BCI where the signal from the cerebrum is unreliable either due to disease or injury.",

      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",
