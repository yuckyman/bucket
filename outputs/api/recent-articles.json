      "title": "Ocular diagnostics and occipital neurovascular coupling in ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma",
      "content": "IntroductionThe relationship between glaucoma and neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex has yet to be fully explored and understood. This study employs the time-domain (TD) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to noninvasively monitor the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in the visual cortex.Methods203 eyes (104 subjects, 46 females, 58 males): 44 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 38 with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 54 with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 67 without abnormal/pathologic condition, were analyzed. All subjects had a complete eye examination, including Goldmann tonometry, computerized visual field optical coherence tomography, pattern electroretinogram, and visual evoked potentials. Visual cortex HRF was assessed by TD-fNIRS using a standard stimulation protocol (reversed checkerboard at 10\u202fHz). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to obtain groups (clusters) of eyes based on the respective TD-fNIRS parameters. The relationships between the clusters and the diagnostic groups were assessed by comparing the distributions of the former ones among healthy, hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes.ResultsWe found six clusters of eyes, five representing eyes with consistent measurements of HRF amplitudes across acquisition channels (left/right hemisphere) and repeated stimuli, distinguished by distinct magnitudes of neurovascular coupling. The sixth cluster included all the cases of incoherent HRF patterns. Evidence of a different distribution between glaucomatous and healthy eyes was found (p\u202f=\u202f0.0009), suggesting that high levels of neurovascular coupling are less likely to be observed in NTG and OAG groups.ConclusionOccipital TD-fNIRS could be fruitfully implemented in a clinical setting to provide significant and easy-to-get insights on neurovascular dynamics, supporting the differential diagnosis of glaucomatous patients. Our findings highlight the importance of the underappreciated correlates between glaucoma and overall neurologic status.",

      "content": "IntroductionMotor imagery (MI) classification and sleep apnea (SA) detection are two critical tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) and biomedical signal analysis. Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

      "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",

      "title": "The interaction of regulated forms of cell death in the pathogenesis of severe facial paralysis and potential therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Neuronal cell death plays a central role in the pathogenesis of facial paralysis. In the constructed severe facial paralysis model, axonal damage becomes the key factor triggering retrograde neuronal degeneration, resulting in a large number of neuronal deaths, which seriously affects the function of the facial nerve. The basic fibroblast growth factor exhibits strong neuroprotective ability and can significantly reduce the neuronal mortality rate, providing a strong guarantee for neuronal survival. Viral infection is also an important pathogenic factor that cannot be ignored. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 can trigger neuroinflammation through the immune response, further exacerbating nerve damage. However, recent studies have also brought hope. Neural reconstruction techniques, targeted drugs, and stem cell therapies hold potential value in promoting the recovery of damaged neural functions. These research results reveal that multiple factors affect the survival and function of neurons in facial paralysis through different pathways, laying a theoretical foundation for targeted treatment against neuronal death. In the future, based on these mechanisms, developing new therapies will bring new treatment opportunities for patients with severe facial paralysis, potentially improving their prognosis and significantly enhancing their quality of life, with important clinical value.",
