      "title": "Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network",
      "content": "Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.",

      "title": "Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research",
      "content": "Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.",

      "title": "Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day",
      "content": "Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 +/- 3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 +/- 1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Structural basis of CO2 valence coding in Drosophila",
      "content": "In the olfactory system, glomerular sensory channels of single receptor identity support reliable odor recognition for appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors. For many olfactory stimuli, the assigned sensory value is innate but weighted by the internal state and previous experiences. How context-dependent modulation of innate valence coding supports distinct behavioral responses is poorly understood. Here we show that CO2 sensory information in Drosophila, intrinsically aversive but modified by attractive food signals, diverges from the canonical glomerular channel already in the antennal lobe via the polarized local interneuron LN23. LN23 relays sensory input via an extraglomerular CO2 pathway and manipulation of LN23 activity revealed a dominant role in CO2-induced avoidance behavior. The extraglomerular CO2 pathway projects to the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) adjacent to the canonical Lateral Horn (LH) olfactory processing center and segregates into anatomically distinct valence channels. Connectome data together with functional characterization showed the convergence of parallel CO2 channels onto two interconnected 3rd order neurons which integrate additional sensory modalities via distinct mechanisms: while the glomerular CO2 pathway converge with food relay neurons onto separated dendritic domains of the PD5 interneuron in the LH, the extraglomerular pathways integrating CO2 information with antennal humidity and temperature modalities establish antagonistic inputs onto the PLP interneuron PV9. This early anatomical divergence of a defined olfactory channel followed by separated multimodal integration provides a structural basis for context-dependent valence coding and appropriate behavioral responses.",

      "content": "Choice-related neural activity, reflecting trial-by-trial correlation with subjects perceptual choice, is commonly observed in sensory cortices and has been implied in sensory readout. Recent studies suggest an alternative source from motor-reporting, yet its precise nature remain elusive due to limitations in conventional experimental paradigms. Here we quantitatively identified motor component by training macaques to discriminate visual motion directions via making saccade to spatial-independent, colored choice targets appeared under two contexts: at stimulus onset, or after its offset. Neural recordings in visual areas MT/MST revealed a dominant motor-related choice signal when the saccade goal was known in advance; this signal vanished with delayed target onset. By comparing with downstream sensory-motor transformation areas and employing a recurrent network model, we demonstrated that this motor component reflected feedback. Our work clarifies that a major portion of \"decision\" activity in sensory neurons is attributable to motor-reporting processes, highlighting the profound influence of behavioral context.",

Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.
