      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

If all goes well, we'll release pandas 3.0.0 in a few weeks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Release candidate: <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases/tag/v3.0.0rc0\">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases/tag/v3.0.0rc0</a></li> <li>Full release notes: <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html\">https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html</a></li> <li>Tracking issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57064\">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57064</a></li> </ul> <p>A very concise, incomplete list of changes:</p> <h4>String Data Type by Default</h4> <p>Previously, pandas represented text columns using NumPy's generic &quot;object&quot; dtype. Starting with pandas 3.0, string columns now use a dedicated &quot;str&quot; dtype (backed by PyArrow when available). This means:</p> <ul> <li>String columns are inferred as dtype &quot;str&quot; instead of &quot;object&quot;</li> <li>The str dtype only holds strings or missing values (stricter than object)</li> <li>Missing values are always NaN with consistent semantics</li> <li>Better performance and memory efficiency</li> </ul> <h4>Copy-on-Write Behavior</h4> <p>All indexing operations now consistently behave as if they return copies. This eliminates the confusing &quot;view vs copy&quot; distinction from earlier versions:</p> <ul> <li>Any subset of a DataFrame or Series always behaves like a copy</li> <li>The only way to modify an object is to directly modify that object itself</li> <li>&quot;Chained assignment&quot; no longer works (and the SettingWithCopyWarning is removed)</li> <li>Under the hood, pandas uses views for performance but copies when needed</li> </ul> <h4>Python and Dependency Updates</h4> <ul> <li>Minimum Python version: 3.11</li> <li>Minimum NumPy version: 1.26.0</li> <li>pytz is now optional (uses zoneinfo from standard library by default)</li> <li>Many optional dependencies updated to recent versions</li> </ul> <h4>Datetime Resolution Inference</h4> <p>When creating datetime objects from strings or Python datetime objects, pandas now infers the appropriate time resolution (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds) instead of always defaulting to nanoseconds. This matches the behavior of scalar Timestamp objects.</p> <h4>Offset Aliases Renamed</h4> <p>Frequency aliases have been updated for clarity:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;M&quot; \u2192 &quot;ME&quot; (MonthEnd)</li> <li>&quot;Q&quot; \u2192 &quot;QE&quot; (QuarterEnd)</li> <li>&quot;Y&quot; \u2192 &quot;YE&quot; (YearEnd)</li> <li>Similar changes for business variants</li> </ul> <h4>Deprecation Policy Changes</h4> <p>Pandas now uses a 3-stage deprecation policy: DeprecationWarning initially, then FutureWarning in the last minor version before removal, and finally removal in the next major release. This gives downstream packages more time to adapt.</p> <h4>Notable Removals</h4> <p>Many previously deprecated features have been removed, including:</p> <ul> <li>DataFrame.applymap (use map instead)</li> <li>Series.view and Series.ravel</li> <li>Automatic dtype inference in various contexts</li> <li>Support for Python 2 pickle files</li> <li>ArrayManager</li> <li>Various deprecated parameters across multiple methods</li> </ul> <p>Install with:</p> <p><code>Python pip install --upgrade --pre pandas </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdb5u2/pandas_30_release_candidate_tagged/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdb5u2/pandas_30_release_candidate_tagged/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Directed cortico-limbic dialogue in the human brain",
      "content": "How can one trace the brain's orderly directed signals amid a tangle of nerve fibers? Because direct access to actual brain signaling is rare in humans, the precise wiring diagrams for cortico-limbic communication during sleep and wake remain essentially unmapped, hampering progress in neuroscience. Now, a unique neurosurgical window on the human brain allows for electrically mapping cortical connections at the hospital, but studies so far have relied on average signals, masking the dynamic nature of signal flow across brain regions. To causally estimate signaling dynamics, we repeatedly probed cortico-limbic networks with short-lived electrical pulses over days and assessed the variable fate of each transmitted signal on a single-trial basis. In the resulting openly available dataset, we characterized signaling probabilities and directionality across thousands local and long-range cortico-limbic connections over days. Challenging established views, we found that limbic structures send twice as many signals as they receive, in both wakefulness and sleep. Our findings provide a fundamental framework for causally interpreting signal flow in the brain and formulating therapeutic strategies for brain networks disorders.",

      "content": "The dorsal root ganglion (DRG), a key site for the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, was examined for sex-dependent phenotypes in sensory neurons, satellite glial cells (SGCs), and local macrophages following traumatic nerve injury and during natural pain resolution. Systematic analysis of 7,495 DRG immunofluorescence images and 62 transcriptomes revealed pronounced sex-specific, multicellular DRG phenotypes, especially during pain resolution. System parameters, including tissue size and neuron density also showed sex-dependent differences. Neuropathic pain resolved without tissue or sensory neuron loss. After injury, macrophages invaded the space between sensory neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs); this was partially reversed during pain resolution, particularly in males. In females, immune-related gene expression and macrophage phenotypes persisted longer, while SGC activation and contact to sensory neurons was more persistent in males. During resolution, synaptic and excitability-related processes were pronounced in both sexes. However, while injury responses were largely shared between sexes, the resolution phase displayed distinctly sex-specific molecular and cellular signatures.",

      "title": "Ventral Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Regulate Decision-Making or Motor Impulsivity Differentially across Learning and Biological Sex",
      "content": "<p>Dopaminergic transmission within the ventral striatum is broadly implicated in risk/reward decision-making and impulse control, and the rat gambling task (rGT) measures both behaviors concurrently. While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviors uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the relative importance of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary as learning progresses; the former should dominate while rats learn the probabilistic contingencies of the task, whereas suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is established and exploited. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically influence reinforcement learning by modulating dopamine (DA) release and gating periods of DA-facilitated neuroplasticity. We therefore hypothesized that ventral striatal CINs (vsCINs) could influence reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or stable performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics in Sprague Dawley rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), we found support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of vsCINs once behavior was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting vsCINs during task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity but instead decreased and increased risky choice, respectively. Notably, the former effect was only observed in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing testable predictions regarding acetylcholine&ndash;DA interactions that may explain sex differences.</p>",

      "title": "Orofacial Movements: Individuality and Stereotypy When Mice Move a Single Whisker to Touch",
      "content": "<p>A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch behavior are unknown. Here we trained five head-fixed male and 11 female mice in a go-cue task to move a whisker to touch a sensor. Our analysis of orofacial movements shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e., whether go-cue triggered movement had begun or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude, and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task&mdash;to touch the sensor within 2&nbsp;s&mdash;how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.</p>",
