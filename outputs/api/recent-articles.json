      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Coordinated infraslow cortical oscillations of neuromodulators during NREM sleep",
      "content": "Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators regulate brain states through diverse mechanisms, yet how their activities are coordinated during sleep remains unresolved. Using in vivo fiber photometry in adult mice expressing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, combined with EEG/EMG recordings, we investigated the temporal organization of multiple neuromodulators during sleep in barrel cortex, with norepinephrine (NE) as a reference signal. All five neuromodulators examined, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and NE, exhibited synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations during NREM sleep. Optogenetic suppression of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons abolished NE oscillations and selectively reduced acetylcholine fluctuations in barrel cortex, whereas targeted inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons attenuated REM-associated acetylcholine elevations without disrupting NREM-related oscillations or NE dynamics. The synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations spanning multiple neuromodulators reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for organizing sleep architecture.",

      "title": "Constitutive DREADD signalling modulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell bioelectrical membrane properties and fate",
      "content": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are small cells in the central nervous system that proliferate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life, allowing for myelin plasticity and repair. G protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors can regulate OPC fate, but the role of individual G protein families is unclear. Here, we use chemogenetics to directly investigate the role of Gq and Gi proteins in OPC fate. We find that expressing the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) hM3Dq or hM4Di in OPCs without activating them with designer agonists induces constitutive G protein signalling, which alters bioelectrical membrane properties such as voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors in OPCs. Further, we find that hM3Dq or hM4Di expression alone modulates OPC fate, increasing or decreasing differentiation, respectively, suggesting that directly targeting G protein signalling can be used to bidirectionally regulate differentiation. Importantly, our data raise a note of caution regarding the use of DREADDs in both excitable and non-excitable small cells.",

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.
