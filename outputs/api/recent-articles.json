      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve tried both Windsurf and Sweep AI on a mid-sized Python codebase. Windsurf is honestly impressive when it comes to reasoning through changes and suggesting higher-level approaches, but I\u2019ve noticed I still have to carefully review everything once multiple modules are involved. It\u2019s powerful, but it can drift if I\u2019m not very explicit.</p> <p>Sweep AI, on the other hand, feels slower and more conservative, but I\u2019ve started trusting it more for refactors that touch several files. It seems to respect how the project is structured instead of trying to be too clever, which has mattered more as the codebase grows.</p> <p>Do you prefer faster, more ambitious tools, or ones that are less exciting but easier to trust long-term?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Doug24\"> /u/Doug24 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvl8lv/windsurf_plugin_vs_sweep_ai_for_larger_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvl8lv/windsurf_plugin_vs_sweep_ai_for_larger_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store. </p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> </p> <p>TidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders. </p> <p><em>The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.</em> </p> <p>This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules. </p> <p>The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.</p> <p>Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool. </p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases. </p> <p>Check out the app at: <a href=\"https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit\">TidyBit GitHub Repository</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swaroop_34\"> /u/swaroop_34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I developed a Python library called typed-pytest during the Christmas holiday. It's now available on PyPI (v0.1.0 - early beta).</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>typed-pytest is a type-safe mocking library for pytest. When you use MagicMock(MyClass) in pytest, your IDE loses all autocomplete - you can't see the original class methods, and mock assertions like assert_called_once_with() have no type hints.</p> <p>typed-pytest fixes this by providing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Full IDE autocomplete for both original class methods and mock assertion methods</strong></li> <li><strong>Lint-time typo detection - misspelled method names are caught by mypy/pyright before tests run</strong></li> <li><strong>Type-checked mock properties - return_value, side_effect, call_count are properly typed</strong></li> <li><strong>Stub generator CLI - generates project-specific type stubs for your classes</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>from typed_pytest_stubs import typed_mock, UserService mock = typed_mock(UserService) mock.get_usr # \u274c Caught by type checker: &quot;get_usr&quot; is not a known member mock.get_user.assert_called_once_with(1) # \u2705 Autocomplete + type-checked! </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>Python developers who use pytest with mocks and want better IDE support and type safety. Especially useful for those practicing TDD or working with AI coding assistants where fast feedback on syntax errors is important.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>The standard unittest.mock.MagicMock provides no type information - your IDE treats everything as Any. Some developers use cast() to recover the original type, but then you lose access to mock-specific methods like assert_called_with().</p> <p>typed-pytest gives you both: original class signatures AND mock method type hints, all with full IDE autocomplete.</p> <p>Check out the project at: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest\">https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest</a></p> <p><strong>Still early beta - feedback, contributions, and \u2b50 are all appreciated!</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kr_roach\"> /u/kr_roach </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

      "title": "Dysregulated Microglial Synaptic Engulfment in Diffuse Midline Glioma",
      "content": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a near-universally lethal form of pediatric high-grade glioma, driven by neuronal activity-regulated paracrine signaling and synaptic integration of malignant cells into neural circuits. In turn, DMG increases neuronal excitability, augmenting neuron-to-glioma signaling. In the healthy brain, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity. However, the role of microglia in promoting tumor-associated hyperexcitable neural networks in glioma remains unknown. Here, we investigate the activity-regulated engulfment of neuronal synapses by microglia in both healthy and glioma-bearing mice, and further explore how glioma cells alter microglia-mediated circuit refinement, contributing to pathogenic neuronal hyperexcitability. Microglia-mediated circuit refinement in the glioma microenvironment was characterized through synaptic engulfment analysis of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses by microglia in healthy mice and patient-derived DMG xenograft models, paired with optogenetic stimulation in the neocortex. We found that glutamatergic neuronal activity in the healthy brain increased excitatory synaptic engulfment by microglia in a previously unappreciated negative feedback mechanism that may guard against hyperexcitability. In contrast, this activity-regulated increase in excitatory synaptic engulfment was abrogated in DMG-infiltrated brains. Instead, inhibitory synaptic engulfment was significantly increased in DMG in response to glutamatergic neuronal activity. Together, these dysregulated synaptic engulfment mechanisms may create imbalance in the excitatory to inhibitory (E:I) synapse ratio predicted to increase neuronal excitability. Complementary single-nuclei sequencing studies revealed concordant tumor-specific, activity-regulated changes in microglia-neuron signaling showing reduced expression of excitatory synaptic refinement gene programs in microglia, potentially mediating the aberrant synaptic engulfment observed in DMG. These findings reveal novel cancer-neuron-immune interactions in DMG and provide an opportunity to potentially modulate tumor-associated neuronal hyperexcitability by targeting aberrant microglial synaptic engulfment.",

      "content": "Awake mouse fMRI is a powerful tool for both neuroscience and translational research. To minimize head motion during scanning, habituation under physical restraint is commonly used. However, it remains unclear how stress levels and head motion evolve during habituation, particularly within the MRI environment. To address this, we repeatedly measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in three groups of mice - controls, mice habituated outside the MRI magnet, and mice habituated within the fMRI environment - and acquired longitudinal resting-state fMRI data daily during an eight-day habituation period and again 15 days post-habituation at 15.2 T. We found that CORT levels initially increased by approximately twofold and gradually decreased during habituation outside the magnet, whereas in mice habituated within the fMRI environment, CORT levels increased two- to fourfold and remained elevated throughout the habituation period. One week after habituation, CORT levels returned to baseline in both groups. Throughout all resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, head motion and functional connectivity remained stable, likely due to the well-designed restraint cradle that permitted paw movement. These results suggest that additional habituation days do not further reduce stress, provided that head motion remains within acceptable limits.",

      "title": "Environmental Conflict Modulates Pavlovian Bias",
      "content": "Pavlovian avoidance enables rapid defensive responding but can undermine goal directed behaviour when it overrides instrumental control, a tendency amplified in anxiety. Whether such biases can be flexibly and rapidly modulated by environmental structure remains unknown. Here we show that global conflict in the environment can suppress Pavlovian avoidance and enhance instrumental choice, particularly in individuals high in trait anxiety. One hundred and sixteen participants completed a sequential approach avoidance task in which three options differed in reward-punishment conflict, and blocks varied the frequency of high conflict encounters. In low conflict environments, participants exhibited pronounced and misplaced avoidance of objectively safe, no conflict options indicating that choices are not determined by local contingencies alone but are tuned to broader environmental context. Interestingly, increasing environmental conflict reduced this maladaptive avoidance: approach to safe options increased, and reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling revealed higher reward sensitivity and drift rates alongside reduced lapse and Pavlovian bias parameters. These effects were strongest in high anxious individuals, whose behaviour shifted markedly toward that of low anxious peers. Crucially, benefits depended on the frequency of conflict encounters and were not elicited by cue outcome reversals or increased punishment probability alone. Furthermore, a modified Go/NoGo task replicated global conflict dependent improvements on Pavlovian incongruent trials. Together, these results demonstrate that global environmental conflict can rapidly recalibrate the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental systems, attenuating maladaptive avoidance and disproportionately aiding anxious individuals. We propose that conflict driven arousal dynamics, plausibly mediated by LC-NE mechanisms, promote this adaptive reconfiguration of defensive and goal directed control.",
