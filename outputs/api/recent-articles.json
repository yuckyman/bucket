      "title": "Impaired gephyrin G-domain trimerization and phase separation in a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy",
      "content": "Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder is frequently linked to genetic variants in synaptic proteins. Here, we describe a de novo pathogenic missense variant in the gephyrin G-domain (G134R) identified in an epileptic patient with developmental delay and seizures. Functional analyses reveal that G134R disrupts higher-order oligomerization, leading to impaired liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and synaptic clustering. Recombinant G134R-gephyrin variant forms lower oligomers with reduced molybdenum cofactor (Moco) synthesis. In non-neuronal cells, G134R fails to oligomerize beyond dimers and loses Moco synthesis function. In neurons, G134R is unable to form synaptic clusters and exerts a dominant-negative effect on WT-gephyrin, severely disrupting inhibitory synapse formation. Our findings highlight a critical role for the G-domain in gephyrin self-assembly and LLPS, shifting the focus from the E-domain-centric view of gephyrin function and providing a novel molecular mechanism for epilepsy linked to G-domain mutations.",

      "title": "Emotional modulation of visual cortical reactivation during true and false memories",
      "content": "Previous research revealed that memory retrieval is associated with a reactivation of sensory cortices reflecting the content of the memory. Further, such reactivation is stronger when retrieval is cued with emotional information as compared with neutral information. However, past studies focused on correct retrieval, and it remains unknown whether a similar reactivation occurs during memory errors, and whether this is enhanced in emotional contexts. Here, we hypothesized that emotion may influence memory errors due to an increase of sensory cortical reactivation at the cost of recovering episodic details (i.e. leading to incorrect retrieval of non-specific associations shared with other cues). We compared brain activations during successful memory retrieval and memory errors in 18 healthy participants who encoded unique negative or neutral scenes paired with one of four associated faces, shared with other trials. Participants were tested the next day with a scene-cued associative retrieval test, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results from a face-responsive region of interest in fusiform cortex (unlike a control place-responsive region in parahippocampal cortex) showed stronger activation for both Hits ('Old' | Target) and False Alarms ('Old' | Foil), as compared with Misses ('New' | Target) and Correct Rejections ('New' | Foil). The emotional content of scene cues did not modulate activation patterns during correct retrieval but produced specific effects on Misattribution errors (incorrect 'Old' | Target, i.e., retrieval of an incorrect face cued by a previously seen scene). Specifically, Misattributions were accompanied by increased fusiform activation comparable to Hits when cued by negative scenes, but low fusiform activation similar to Misses when cued by neutral scenes. Unlike Misattributions, however, Hits cued by emotional information recruited a distinctive network previously linked to personal episodic memories, including medial prefrontal, cingulate, and hippocampal regions, together with enhanced functional coupling between the latter and fusiform cortex. No implicit effect of previous face exposure was observed in the fusiform during Misses, regardless of emotion context. Our results suggest that the reactivation of sensory areas follows subjective memory experience during retrieval, and that emotion can enhance such mechanism when the cue is recognized but detailed episodic memory mediated by fronto-hippocampal circuits is absent, leading to the retrieval of inappropriate associations and false memories.",

      "title": "Selective Age-Related Changes in Brain Network Connectivity During Young Adulthood: Sensory Networks Decrease While Hub Networks Remain Stable",
      "content": "Young adulthood (ages 22-35 years) represents an important period for brain development, yet mechanisms underlying age-related connectivity changes remain poorly understood. We examined developmental trajectories in 66 healthy young adults (22 per age group: 22-25, 26-30, 31-35 years) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the Human Connectome Project. Contrary to expectations of global increases, we found selective age-related changes: sensory networks (visual and auditory) showed significant decreases in connectivity with age (visual: slope = -0.0133, p = 0.038; auditory: slope = -0.0184, p = 0.012), while hub networks (default mode and frontoparietal) and other networks remained stable (all p > 0.15). Network coupling analysis revealed a mechanistic explanation: sensory networks decouple from hub networks with age (DMN-AUD: change = -0.77; DMN-VIS: change = -0.56), while sensory networks show increased coupling with each other (VIS-AUD: +0.18). This decoupling explains why only sensory networks show age-related changes, as they become independent from hub networks during young adulthood. Importantly, total IQ showed no significant association with network connectivity (all |r| < 0.10, all p > 0.43), strengthening the developmental interpretation. Machine learning revealed the somatomotor network was most predictive of age. All effects remained consistent after controlling for head motion and across sexes. These results demonstrate selective, network-specific developmental trajectories during young adulthood, with sensory networks becoming independent from hub networks and showing age-related decreases, while hub networks maintain stability.",

      "title": "Cortical responses to balance perturbations persist without active postural control",
      "content": "Standing balance relies on rapid reflexes as well as longer-latency subcortical and cortical processes to generate corrective responses to postural disturbances. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies consistently identify two perturbation-evoked markers of cortical activity, the balance N1 and midfrontal theta power, associated with changes in body orientation and corrective actions. It remains unclear, however, whether these markers depend on the nervous system's active control of posture or reflect a more general evaluation of unexpected sensory input. We tested this by measuring cortical and muscle activity during support-surface perturbations while systematically manipulating whether participants actively controlled posture. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), participants experienced identical perturbations while either actively balancing or being passively moved through equivalent motion. Despite large reductions in balance-correcting muscle activity during passive trials (~30-60%), N1 and theta responses persisted with only modest amplitude reductions (~10%). In Experiment 2 (n = 16), we created passive conditions increasingly removed from balance by varying sensory feedback (footplate + whole-body vs footplate-only motion) and motor engagement (isometric contraction vs. relaxed posture). Relaxed postures markedly suppressed muscle responses, yet cortical responses persisted, showing only modest modulation with sensory feedback (larger during footplate-only rotations) and no dependence on motor engagement. Together, these results indicate that N1 and midfrontal theta are not dependent on active postural control and persist even without matching sensory feedback or motor engagement. Rather than reflecting the generation or scaling of corrective actions, they index the early detection and evaluation of unexpected sensory events, consistent with prediction error or surprise processing.",

      "title": "Focal brain stimulation sites that modify autonomic arousal map to a convergent brain circuit and potential therapeutic target",
      "content": "Causal modulation of autonomic outflow could yield new therapeutic targets for autonomic hyperactivation. We employed three natural experiments in which different brain regions were targeted using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n=139 sites, n=14 individuals), deep brain stimulation (n=392 sites, n=58 individuals), or low-intensity focused ultrasound (n=46 sites, n=23 individuals) with subsequent autonomic measurements. Using a human connectome database (n=1000) as a wiring diagram, we identified a convergent brain circuit that, when focally modulated, transiently reduces autonomic arousal. This circuit significantly resembled previously reported causal circuits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. In independent datasets, TMS to the autonomic arousal circuit reduced laboratory startle in healthy volunteers (n=28), lesions to this circuit reduced exaggerated startle in PTSD (n=193), and TMS to this circuit reduced anxiety-related autonomic symptoms in patients with clinically significant anxiety (n=30). Thus, the convergent circuit may serve as a potential neuromodulation target for autonomic hyperactivation.",

      "title": "Energetic implications of fMRI-based nodal complex network metrics: a complex picture unfolds across diverse brain states",
      "content": "Functional MRI-based graph theory has provided profound insights into the brain's functional organization, yet the neuroenergetic meaning of widely used graph-theoretical metrics remains poorly understood. Although resting-state research suggests a positive coupling between network topology and glucose metabolism, it remains unclear whether this relationship reflects a general principle of brain organization or a state-specific phenomenon. Here, we test the neuroenergetic interpretability of nodal graph-theoretical metrics by linking complex network topology to cerebral glucose consumption across diverse brain states. Leveraging simultaneous functional PET-MRI, we directly compare state-dependent fluctuations in glucose consumption and network topology during sensory, cognitive, and arousal conditions. We further assess metabolic-topological couplings in disease through a meta-analysis of resting-state FDG-PET and fMRI studies involving Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Our results show that nodal graph-theoretical metrics exhibit state- and network-dependent metabolic associations, with coupling patterns diverging across experimental and disease contexts. Notably, frontoparietal and attentional networks show more conserved metabolic-topological coupling than other large-scale networks across states. These findings underscore a dynamic, complex interplay between metabolic demand and complex network organization, highlighting the need for a nuanced interpretation of the energetic underpinnings of nodal graph-theoretical metrics in health and disease.",
