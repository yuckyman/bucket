      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Structural MRI provides a noninvasive window into brain morphology, yet the reproducibility and interpretability of morphometric analyses remain limited by inconsistent preprocessing, variable spatial alignment, and heterogeneous feature construction. We introduce MORPH2DIAG, a fully automated, atlas-free morphometric pipeline that integrates standardized preprocessing, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, data-driven subtyping, and machine- and deep-learning classification within a single, modular framework. The pipeline performs intensity normalization, morphological cleanup, PCA-informed affine alignment, isotropic rescaling, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) segmentation to generate quantitative gray-matter (GM), white-matter (WM), and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) maps. Global tissue fractions were used to derive latent neuroanatomical subtypes via unsupervised K-means clustering, revealing progressive GM--CSF gradients consistent with patterns commonly observed along normative-to-atrophic structural continua observed in neurodegeneration. To capture finer-grained spatial heterogeneity, a voxel-wise K-means parcellation yielded parcel-level intensity means and variances that served as regional morphometric descriptors. These global and parcel-level features were integrated into a unified evaluation suite comparing classical machine learning models (Random Forests, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with lean, deep, and hybrid multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) trained using focal loss, label smoothing, stochastic weight averaging, and nested cross-validation with PCA-based dimensionality reduction. Across methods, the hybrid MLP achieved the highest macro-F1 and balanced accuracy, demonstrating strong discriminative performance for the discovered morphometric subtypes. Collectively, MORPH2DIAG establishes a fully automated, atlas-free framework that unites unsupervised structural subtype discovery with interpretable machine and deep learning, providing a reproducible foundation for MRI-based morphometric profiling and automated detection of neurodegenerative-like patterns.",

      "title": "The cost of dual-task walking: cognitive demands restrict visual search and gait planning",
      "content": "Adaptive walking relies on proactive visual search to plan foot placement and maintain stability. This study examined how cognitive load and task complexity affect gaze behaviour and gait biomechanics during a precision target-stepping task in healthy young adults. We also quantified the frequency of cross-stepping during the experimental task. Twenty-three participants (18-23 years) walked along an L-shaped pathway containing raised stepping targets under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Targets had four different layouts to create high and low difficulty conditions. Eye movements were recorded using mobile eye-tracking, and gait kinematics were captured via motion capture. Compared with ST, DT walking produced slower walking speeds, longer stance times, and reduced velocity between stepping targets, indicating a more inefficient gait strategy. Eye-tracking analyses revealed fewer and shorter fixations on task-relevant targets and a greater number of fixations directed toward task-irrelevant areas under DT conditions. In DT, saccadic amplitudes were reduced despite increased outside fixations, suggesting a breakdown in visual exploration between proximal and distal regions of the walkway. Cross-stepping was more frequent in ST conditions than in DT. These findings indicate that increased cognitive load compromises proactive visual search, likely through working-memory and attentional limitations that disrupt feedforward gait planning. Contrary to expectation, cross-stepping occurred more often during ST than DT walking, suggesting that in this population cross-stepping may not be a maladaptive strategy. Overall, these results highlight the cognitive demands of adaptive walking even in young, low-risk individuals and underscore the importance of preserving visual-motor coordination under cognitive stress.",

      "title": "A Load-Induced Energetic Tipping Point Explains Selective Vulnerability of Substantia Nigra Neurons",
      "content": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease, while closely related neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are comparatively spared. Although mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and -synuclein aggregation have each been implicated, none alone explains why anatomically similar populations exhibit such different fates. Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures only mitochondrial functional capacity, energetic reserve, and the combined load from axonal arborization and calcium handling. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals that increasing structural load deforms the energetic landscape until a saddle-node bifurcation emerges, producing coexisting healthy-energy and collapsed-energy states. SNc-like neurons, which bear extreme axonal and calcium-handling demands, reside inside this bistable regime, operating near a separatrix that renders them vulnerable to even modest metabolic perturbations. In contrast, VTA-like neurons lie outside the bistable window and robustly return to their high-energy state following similar disturbances. The model reproduces hallmark features of Parkinsonian degeneration - long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility - using only the geometry of load-dependent energy regulation. These findings suggest that selective SNc vulnerability arises not from unique molecular defects, but from the fundamental dynamical structure imposed by their extraordinary anatomical and physiological load.",

      "title": "Selective distractor representations resolve multidimensional interference",
      "content": "How can humans manage multiple sources of information competing for attention? To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of this reactive suppression, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Behavioral and neural effects converged to show that dimension-specific interference and adaptation are associated with the speed of visual integration of each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process.",

      "title": "Order code in the olfactory system.",
      "content": "The ability to recognize odor identity across a wide range of concentrations is essential for natural olfactory behaviors However how odor identity is represented in the early olfactory system remains an open question One theory proposes that glomeruli in the olfactory bulb along with their associated odorant receptors ORs are activated by odorants in a temporal order that conveys information about odor identity This order code is relatively robust to concentration changes as the rank order of glomerular activation by a given odorant remains similar across concentrations Alternatively the primacy coding theory suggests that odor identity is defined by the most sensitive ORs those that respond first collectively referred to as the primacy set To test these theories we measured glomerular responses to a large set of odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb using calcium imaging We found that receptor affinities can be embedded in a lowdimensional space D 10 with minimal loss of information Within this space we identified two clusters of glomeruli with distinct tuning properties that form independent odor representations These clusters may correspond to the two phylogenetic classes of ORs as revealed by both their functional characteristics and anatomical locations In the OR affinity space odorants evoke orderly activation waves whose directions can be used to define odor identities in the order coding model Finally we compared the order code and primacy model in predicting odor identity both across concentrations and across animals Despite containing less information overall the primacy model performed comparably to the order code We confirmed the primacy models prediction that each receptor tends to contribute to the primacy set of at least one odorant Analysis of binary odor mixtures revealed that mixture responses lie along geodesic lines connecting their component odors Together these findings suggest that odor information in the olfactory bulb may be represented through two complementary coding strategies the primacy and order codes.",
