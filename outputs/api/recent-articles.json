      "title": "Catestatin ameliorates tauopathy and amyloidogenesis via adrenergic inhibition",
      "content": "Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are characterized by Tau aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation and progressive cognitive decline. Although metabolic dysregulation and neuropeptide imbalance have been linked to these disorders, the functional consequences of such imbalance and its potential for therapeutic reversal remain poorly understood. Our previous work identified chromogranin A, which encodes a pro-hormone for several metabolic peptides, as a key regulator of Tau pathology. Here, we investigate Catestatin, a chromogranin A derived peptide that is a potent inhibitor of catecholamine release and has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower peripheral blood pressure. We report significant reductions in CST levels in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, as well as in the frontal cortex of CBD and the basal ganglia of PSP. Supplementing CST in cortical neuronal cultures and organotypic slice cultures decreased Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. In vivo, CST administration in PS19 Tauopathy mice reduced pathological Tau species, attenuated gliosis, and improved cognitive function. CST treatment also lowered amyloid plaque burden and neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Mechanistically, CST decreased epinephrine levels in both PS19 and 5XFAD mice and suppressed downstream protein kinase A hyperactivation in PS19 and OTSC. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized neuropeptidergic mechanism linking CST deficiency to elevated adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and PKA stress signaling and Tauopathy driven neurodegeneration, suggesting CST replacement as a promising therapeutic approach.",
