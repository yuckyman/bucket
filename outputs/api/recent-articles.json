      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Loss of the Parkinson's disease-associated protein DJ-1 impacts dopamine metabolism in astrocytes",
      "content": "The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the contribution of glial cells to this vulnerability is not fully understood. Studies in rodent models suggest that astrocytes can take up and metabolize dopamine (DA), potentially protecting neurons by detoxifying reactive DA metabolites via glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2) release. However, these mechanisms remain underexplored in human systems, particularly in the context of PD. Here, we used CRISPR-engineered iPSC-derived human astrocytes with a PD-linked DJ-1 mutation and isogenic controls to investigate astrocytic DA metabolism. Upon DA exposure, control astrocytes upregulated quinone-reducing enzymes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and GSTM2, whereas DJ-1 mutant astrocytes failed to adaptively respond. In addition, only control astrocytes presented with increased DA quinone products upon DA exposure, not DJ-1 mutants. These results demonstrate astrocytic DA handling being disrupted in DJ-1-linked PD, implicating astroglial dysfunction as an important contributor to PD pathogenesis and potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

      "title": "Ultra-High Field 31P functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Reveals NAD+ Dynamics in Brain Energy Metabolism during Visual Stimulation.",
      "content": "We investigated dynamic changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism in the human occipital lobe using ultra-high field 31P functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) at 7 Tesla. Twenty-five healthy volunteers (mean age 24 {+/-} 4 years, 10 female) performed a visual task alternating between fixation and flashing checkerboard stimuli. 31P MRS spectra were acquired from a visual cortex voxel functionally localized by prior fMRI. Linear mixed-effects modelling revealed a significant reduction in NAD+; concentrations during the first stimulation block, while no significant change was observed during the second block. No significant changes were observed for other high-energy phosphate metabolites (ATP, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate), indicating specificity in the NAD+; response. Exploratory analyses, dividing the blocks in two halves, suggested further reductions in NAD+; and tNAD in the second halves of both stimulation blocks, though these trends were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRS at 7T to detect stimulus-induced dynamics in cerebral NAD+; metabolism in vivo, providing insights into the interplay between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation during neural activation.",
