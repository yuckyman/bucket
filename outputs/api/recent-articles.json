      "title": "Sequential development of task representation from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex supports goal-directed spatial navigation",
      "content": "Successful goal-directed navigation requires the coordination between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. However, it is not fully confirmed that the medial prefrontal cortex learns its spatial code from the hippocampus. To test this, we examined spatial representations of the intermediate hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex while rats learned a spatial navigation task. Rats performed a goal-directed spatial navigation task in 2D VR to find an unmarked goal zone, and we discovered robust directional tuning of single neurons in both regions. Neural manifold analysis further confirmed population-level directional tuning in both regions, with manifolds having ring-like geometry. We found that this ring-like structure evolved after learning, in a way that the hippocampal-prefrontal manifolds converged to a shared geometry. Furthermore, this evolution of ring-like structure was preceded by the hippocampus at the trial level. It was further verified that the evolution of the ring-like structure is linked to phase locking to the hippocampal theta rhythm, particularly in the prefrontal manifolds. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spatial representations of the hippocampal-prefrontal network become aligned after learning, and also highlight the information flow from the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex during this geometry synchronization.",

      "title": "A Dual Inhibitory Network in the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus Delineated by Pallidal and Intra-Reticular Inhibition",
      "content": "Long described as an inhibitory \"guardian of the gateway,\" the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) shapes which thalamic signals reach the cortex during attention, arousal, and sensory processing. However, how the inhibitory wiring within TRN supports this flexible gating--from modality-specific tuning to global control--remains poorly defined. Using cell type-specific optogenetic input mapping and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mice, we dissect inhibitory connectivity in TRN from two major GABAergic sources: the TRN itself and the external globus pallidus (GPe). All recorded TRN neurons received inhibition from the GPe, whereas a subset also received intra-TRN inhibition. Intra-TRN inhibition arose predominantly from somatostatin-expressing onto parvalbumin-expressing TRN neurons (SOM[-&gt;]PV), revealing subtype-specific connectivity recruited by thalamic excitation to form a feedforward motif. These findings delineate a dual inhibitory architecture: local intra-TRN circuits provide spatially selective inhibition, whereas pallidal inputs deliver diffuse inhibition. These complementary mechanisms may support both modality-specific gating and global state-dependent control of thalamic output.",

      "title": "Evolution towards higher unitary conductance in mammals makes BK channels more efficient and precise",
      "content": "The large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, known as the BK channel, play an essential role in neuronal firing and is characterized by a very large ~250pS unitary conductance in mammals. However, this high unitary conductance is not consistent across all species with invertebrates demonstrating a much lower unitary conductance. We explored the calcium activation properties of BK channels of different unitary conductance in computational models and found that mammalian channels are more efficiently activated by calcium and produce a stronger potassium current compared to the channels of lower unitary conductance found in invertebrates. The lower unitary conductance channels display fierce competition for the available calcium, which results in low activation and weaker current. Due to these properties, mammalian BK channels are more suitable to repolarize sodium action potentials, which enables more precise spike timing, and may explain why evolution appears to have favored a trend towards very high unitary conductance in mammalian BK channels. This may be an essential component of the more advanced brain functions achieved by these species compared to invertebrates.",

      "title": "HCN channel currents underlie distinct neurophysiology of mediodorsal thalamus subnuclei",
      "content": "The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a hub coordinating cortical and subcortical brain regions to support execu-tive and social/emotional functioning. MD can be subdivided into medial (M), central (C), and lateral (L) based on synaptic coupling, molecular identity, and physiology. Recently, we identified differential intrinsic properties be-tween thalamocortical M and L neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). L neurons projecting to mPFC showed increased hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channel activity compared with M neurons, which caused L neurons to have lower cellular resistance and shorter time windows for integration of inputs. In addition to their role in synaptic integration, HCN channels are critical for thalamic rhythm generation. In this study, we used a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and in situ hybridization to investigate how differences in HCN impact intrinsic oscillatory dynamics in M, C, and L neurons. We found that HCN current (Ih) differed across MD subnuclei with C > L >> M. Clustering neurons based on HCN properties was sufficient to classify subnuclei with >95% accuracy, highlighting the differences in HCN function between sub-nuclei. Greater HCN activity in MD neurons was associated with decreased input resistance, decreased action potential firing, and higher resonant frequency. These findings provide an ionic basis for differences in cellular resonance across MD subnuclei, with implications for thalamic rhythm generation and information processing.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
      "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

      "content": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique based on electromagnetic induction, modulates cortical excitability by inducing currents with a magnetic field. TMS has demonstrated significant clinical potential in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, conventional TMS targeting methods that rely on anatomical landmarks do not adequately account for individual differences in brain structure and functional networks, leading to considerable variability in treatment responses. In recent years, advances in neuroimaging techniques\u2013such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\u2013together with the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in big data analysis, have provided novel approaches for precise TMS targeting and individualized treatment. This review summarizes the latest developments in the integration of multimodal neuroimaging and AI technologies for precision neuromodulation with TMS. It focuses on critical issues such as imaging resolution, AI model generalizability, real-time feedback modulation, as well as data privacy and ethical considerations. Future prospects including closed-loop TMS control systems, cross-modal data fusion, and AI-assisted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are also discussed. Overall, AI-driven personalized TMS strategies hold promise for markedly enhancing treatment precision and clinical efficacy, thereby offering new theoretical and practical guidance for individualized treatment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Street dancing enhances cognitive reserve in young females: an fNIRS study",
      "content": "IntroductionWith the accelerating aging population, cognitive decline and dementia pose major public health challenges. Early intervention is crucial for mitigating these risks. Dance, with its high cognitive demands and multitasking coordination, has shown benefits for cognitive function. However, evidence on the effects of street dance on prefrontal cortex activation and executive function is limited. This study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore how street dance impacts prefrontal activation and executive function, offering insights into early prevention of cognitive decline.MethodsA total of 28 healthy female college students were recruited and randomly assigned to a street dance intervention group (n\u202f=\u202f14) or a control group (n\u202f=\u202f14). The study was conducted between March and September 2024 at a university in Southwest China. The intervention group participated in an 18-week street dance program, three times per week, with each session lasting 80\u202fmin. The control group maintained their usual routines without structured physical activity. fNIRS was used pre- and post-intervention to assess changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO\u2082) levels in the prefrontal cortex during the 2-back, Stroop, and More-Odd Shifting tasks.ResultsTwo-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant Group \u00d7 Time interaction effects in multiple prefrontal regions across the three tasks. In the 2-back task, the street dance group showed significant increases in HbO\u2082 in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, accompanied by improvements in accuracy and faster reaction times. In the Stroop task, HbO\u2082 significantly increased in the right frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, reflecting enhanced inhibitory control. In the More-Odd Shifting task, significant activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus, together with improved task-switching accuracy and reduced reaction times.ConclusionThe 18-week street dance intervention effectively improved working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, contributing to enhanced cognitive reserve. As a physical activity combining rhythm and coordination, street dance offers a promising early intervention strategy for delaying cognitive decline and reducing dementia risk.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier ChiCTR2400083689.",

      "content": "IntroductionBased on tens of neuroimaging studies and a meta-analysis, we know that music expertise is associated with increases in brain volume and activity in structures related to audition, action, and various cognitive functions. What is less known is how music expertise affects the brain\u2019s functional connectivity during music listening.MethodsA novel algorithm, Leading Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis, was used to extract the specific dynamic patterns and the corresponding transition process during a naturalistic free-listening paradigm between 18 musicians and 18 non-musicians.ResultsWe found a brain state involving the frontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortex, associated with higher cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and reward, to be more recurrent in musicians during music listening compared to non-musicians. Transition processes revealed heightened engagement in areas linked to auditory processing, somatosensory integration, cognitive function, and emotional regulation in musicians. This enhanced dynamic connectivity might be linked to musicians\u2019 ability to integrate complex auditory stimuli and derive emotional meaning from them. Non-musicians, conversely, showed a tendency to engage more with the default mode network during music listening, possibly in relation to self-relevant mental processes and connection with personal experiences while being absorbed with the music.DiscussionThese findings highlight how music expertise shapes functional connectivity dynamics, musicians enhancing sensorimotor-cognitive integration and non-musicians relying on emotion and personal engagement.",

      "title": "Emerging roles of primary cilia in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons, for which effective disease-modifying therapies remain elusive. Primary cilia are solitary microtubule-based organelles critical for signal transduction and have recently been implicated in ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we provide a basic overview of the structure, dynamics, and functions of primary cilia, particularly in the brain. We highlight accumulating evidence from ALS models showing altered ciliary structure and function and explore how mutations in ALS-associated genes such as NEK1, C21orf2, and C9orf72 disrupt ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling. Moreover, we examine the interplays between primary cilia dysfunction and known ALS-related mechanisms, including loss of proteostasis, abnormal RNA metabolism, microtubule dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, the evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship in which ciliary impairment and ALS pathomechanisms reinforce one another in a vicious cycle. We further discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ciliary function, as well as the potential for primary cilia as novel clinical applications. Our review highlights primary cilia as a previously underappreciated yet potentially important component of ALS biology, offering novel insights into disease mechanisms and future therapeutic development.",

      "title": "Motor unit number estimation based on convolutional neural network",
      "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",
