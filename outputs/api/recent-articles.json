      "title": "Improved Estimation of Correlation Accuracy for Machine Learning Brain-Phenotype Associations",
      "content": "Machine learning is used in neuroscience to examine brain-phenotype associations and facilitate individual prediction from high-dimensional brain imaging. For continuous phenotypes, Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted phenotype is used to quantify model accuracy in testing data. However, recent research suggests millions of samples may be needed to reliably estimate the maximum achievable predictive accuracy (MAPA). We formally define the MAPA and show that the Pearson estimator is biased for this quantity and its confidence intervals fail to capture the target. We develop a semiparametric (double machine learning) one-step estimator that more accurately estimates the MAPA and yields valid confidence intervals across flexible machine learning settings. Analyzing data from the Reproducible Brain Charts dataset, we show that this estimator has smaller bias when estimating brain-phenotype associations of neuroimaging data with age and psychopathology phenotypes. We show that MAPA for psychopathology factor scores using machine learning models built on structural and functional imaging measures is not better than using demographic and nuisance covariates alone.",

      "title": "ACSS2 mediates prenatal alcohol exposure-related morphological and behavioral phenotypes",
      "content": "The metabolic enzyme Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 (ACSS2) recently emerged as an unexpected regulator of molecular and behavioral changes associated with alcohol use. Its role during prenatal exposure, however, remains unknown. Here, we use a combination of proteomic, genomic and behavioral approaches to establish ACSS2 as a key mediator of prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes. We define the developmental window during which ACSS2 translocates to nuclei in the mouse brain, and show that alcohol-derived acetate is incorporated into fetal brain histone acetylation in utero. Using genetically engineered mice not expressing ACSS2, we demonstrate that loss of this enzyme attenuates chronic prenatal alcohol exposure-induced craniofacial abnormalities, motor function deficits, cognitive impairments as well as associated chromatin and gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus and the cerebellar vermis. Our results outline a previously unknown mechanism underlying prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes regulated by ACSS2, which will inform the development of future therapeutic interventions.",
