      "title": "An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.",

      "title": "Combine Virtual Reality and Machine-Learning to Identify the Presence of Dyslexia: A Cross-Linguistic Approach",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.04510v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.",

      "title": "Conversational AI increases political knowledge as effectively as self-directed internet search",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05219v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05145v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.",

In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.",

      "title": "Evaluating Idle Animation Believability: a User Perspective",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.",

SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models, evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect (Cliff's $\\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04705v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.",

      "content": "Skilled movement often requires flexibly combining multiple subskills, each requiring dedicated control strategies and underlying computations. How the motor system achieves such versatility remains unclear. Using high-density Neuropixels recordings from primary motor cortex (M1) in macaques performing a challenging force-tracking task, we reveal that M1 activity is much higher-dimensional, and far more flexible, than traditionally assumed. Although our task employed only a single external degree of freedom, neural dynamics reflected transitions amongst many dimensions and multiple distinct computations. Different behavioral control strategies were associated with distinct neural locations and dimensions, sometimes used compositionally. Groups of population-level factors became active when a particular form of dynamics was needed, and remained silent otherwise. Neural activity was thus dominated by the engaged subskill, and could be very different even for matched motor output. These findings challenge prevailing views of M1, and reveal an unexpectedly flexible and high-dimensional neural system underlying skilled motor behavior.",

      "content": "Stress is a major risk factor for depression and exerts complex effects on brain function and behavior. In this study, we examined the neural mechanisms of stress responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with particular focus on neuron/astrocyte interactions. Using dual-color fiber photometry, we simultaneously monitored neuronal and astrocytic activity during acute and chronic stress. Acute stressors, including tail pinch and immobilization, evoked coordinated increases in both neuronal and astrocytic activity. In contrast, prolonged exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) produced heightened neuronal activity alongside astrocytic dysfunction. Notably, UCMS disrupted the correlation between neuronal and astrocytic signals, pointing to impaired cellular crosstalk. These findings highlight a critical role of disrupted neuron/astrocyte interactions in shaping maladaptive stress responses and suggest a potential mechanism contributing to stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Developmental excitation-inhibition imbalance permanently reprograms autism-relevant social brain circuits",
      "content": "An influential theory proposes that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition (E:I) plays a central role in the etiology of autism and related developmental disorders. However, controversy exists as to whether this imbalance is a direct causal mechanism for autism, or a compensatory response to other primary etiological factors. Using chemogenetic manipulations in neonatal mice, we show that a transient E:I imbalance during development is sufficient to permanently reprogram autism-relevant social brain circuits. Chemogenetically manipulated mice exhibit lifelong impairments in sociability, persistent dysregulation of multiple autism-risk synaptic genes, and sustained cortical hyperexcitability in adulthood. Importantly, these social impairments are robustly rescued by pharmacological inhibition of neuronal excitability. Developmental E:I imbalance also disrupts functional connectivity in social brain regions enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes, suggesting a convergence of transcriptional and circuit-level pathology. Finally, multivariate modelling shows that behavioral dysfunction in chemogenetically manipulated animals closely associates with disrupted connectivity between prefrontal and mesolimbic dopaminergic regions. Collectively, our findings reconcile conflicting theories in the field and point to activity-dependent transcriptional remodeling as a foundational mechanism by which transient E:I imbalance during development can cause lasting, autism-relevant circuit dysfunction.",

      "title": "Astrocytes mobilize a broader repertoire of lysosomal repair mechanisms than neurons",
      "content": "Lysosomal damage impairs proteostasis and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, yet cell-type-specific differences in lysosomal repair remain unclear. Using a neuron-astrocyte coculture system, we compared responses to lysosomal injury induced by a lysosomotropic methyl ester. Both neurons and astrocytes showed lysosomal damage, marked by galectin-3 recruitment to lumenal lysosomal beta-galactosides, elevated lysosomal pH, and engagement of lysophagy receptors TAX1BP1 and p62. However, astrocytes showed a preferential recruitment of ESCRT repair machinery to damaged lysosomes. Additionally, the lysosomal membrane reformation pathway regulated by the RAB7-GAP, TBC1D15, was more robustly activated in astrocytes. By contrast, the PITT pathway, mediating lipid transfer between the ER and damaged lysosomes, was engaged in both cell types. Our data reveal a divergence in how neurons and astrocytes mobilize repair pathways to manage lysosomal damage. These data may reflect differences in lysosomal resilience between astrocytes and neurons and inform therapeutic strategies to correct lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Reading and speech recognition rely on multi-level processing that builds from basic visual or sound features to complete word representations, yet details of these processing hierarchies (in particular those for spoken words) are still poorly understood. We re-analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data provided in the Mother Of all Unification Studies (MOUS) open-science dataset by using parametric regressions of word frequency and sublexical unit (bigram or syllable) frequency during reading and speech listening tasks in order to elucidate lexical processing hierarchies in the visual and auditory modalities. We first validated our approach in the written word domain, where the technique identified significant correlations for word frequency in the left mid-fusiform cortex (at the location of the Visual Word Form Area) with a left occipital region tracking bigram frequency, compatible with prior reports. During listening, low-frequency spoken words elicited greater responses in a left mid-superior temporal region consistent with the recently-described Auditory Word Form Area (AWFA), while a more posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus was sensitive to syllable frequency. Activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with both written and spoken word frequency. These findings demonstrate parallel hierarchical organizations in the anteroventral visual and auditory streams, with modality-specific lexica and upstream sublexical representations that converge in higher-order language areas.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

      "title": "Imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning for sparse badminton strikes via dynamic trajectory generation",
      "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

      "title": "Ineffectiveness of pioglitazone in cognitive impairment induced by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil via oxidative stress and neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Research objectiveChemotherapy is frequently linked to enduring cognitive impairments in individuals who have survived cancer. The cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) regimen is a standard protocol in cancer treatment. Pioglitazone (PGZ), an oral medication used to treat diabetes, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects against certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PGZ in mitigating cognitive dysfunction caused by CMF.Materials and methodsForty male rats were allocated into four distinct groups: control, CMF-treated, PGZ-treated, and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ-treated, to evaluate survival rates, body weights, and cognitive performance using the Y-maze, novel object recognition test (NORT), and fear conditioning memory assessments. Furthermore, the investigation included an analysis of mitochondrial complex I activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) within the hippocampus.ResultsThe CMF and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ groups exhibited decreased survival rates (50 and 40%, respectively) and reductions in body weight (16 and 11%, respectively). The Y-maze showed fewer entries and less time in the novel arm, but total entries were unchanged. The NORT revealed less exploration of the novel object in both CMF and CMF\u202f+\u202fPGZ groups. In fear conditioning, both groups showed reduced freezing time versus control, indicating memory impairment. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I activity was diminished, and levels of ROS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were elevated in CMF; however, co-treatment with PGZ did not ameliorate these alterations.ConclusionThe CMF treatment resulted in cognitive dysfunction, and the addition of PGZ did not alleviate this neurotoxicity.",

      "content": "BackgroundChronic post-burn pruritus (CPBP) refers to a highly prevalent as well as debilitating problem after burn injuries, substantially impairing patients\u2019 quality of life. Nevertheless, the precise pathological mechanisms underlying CPBP remain elusive. The present study seeks to investigate microstructural changes in gray matter among individuals with CPBP and to evaluate associations between these changes and clinical scale scores via voxel-based morphometry (VBM).Materials and methodsWe recruited 20 people having CPBP and 20 healthy controls (HCs) who were of the same sex and age. T1-weighted imaging in three dimensions (3D-T1WI) was performed on each participant. Using VBM, volumes of gray matter in each region were measured. Volume differences between groups were measured, and it was methodically examined how the volume in particular brain regions correlated with clinical markers.ResultsWe found no discernible age difference between the groups (P > 0.05). Compared with HCs, patients with CPBP showed reduced gray matter volume across multiple brain regions (P < 0.05). These regions encompassed the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, right medial frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left fusiform gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, right medial frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed a negative relationship between the individuals\u2019 Self-Rating Depression Scale scores and the gray matter volume in the right superior temporal gyrus in patients with CPBP (r = \u22120.632, P = 0.003).ConclusionThe frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions all exhibit a marked reduction in volume in response to CPBP.",
