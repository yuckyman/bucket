      "title": "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Biological Sex Differences in Sleep Spindles and Slow Wave Activity in Adults with and without Insomnia",
      "content": "Mounting evidence shows sex-based differences in sleep experiences and outcomes, including the prevalence of insomnia disorder. However, the impact of biological sex on brain oscillations during sleep remains poorly understood, especially in the context of insomnia disorder. This is a notable gap, given that neurophysiological aspects of sleep are associated with brain health and overall sleep quality. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed data from studies reporting spindle and slow wave activity in adults with and without insomnia disorder. We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, with thirteen studies of normal sleepers (N= 668) reporting sufficient data for random-effects meta-analyses. Compared with males, female normal sleepers had higher spindle density, sigma and delta power. Most studies recruited individuals with primary insomnia, and data pooling for insomnia and mixed groups was not possible due to insufficient statistical reporting. Moreover, group-by-sex interactions were limited, inconsistent, and varied across studies and sample characteristics. Further research is needed to explore sex-specific differences in sleep microarchitecture and their role in normal sleep and the manifestation of insomnia disorder.",

      "title": "Geometric structure of features underlies human VTC object recognition.",
      "content": "The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) plays a crucial role in human object recognition. Within VTC neural space, object-specific domains align with domain-general features, e.g. face- and scene-domain align with the feature distribution of animacy, generating a hierarchical knowledge structure for categorization. However, the neural process of integrating information from VTC to distinguish different objects remains unclear. Here, we employed a combination of ANN modeling, functional MRI, and MEG to investigate how VTC features affect object manifold separability. The representational geometry analysis shows that domain-general features in VTC form a unique structure, different from ANN, to assist object classification. Moreover, VTC dynamically adjusts the geometrical relationship of these features during object recognition, influencing the geometrical properties of object manifolds and, consequently, their separability. These findings advance our understanding of the neural computation involved in VTC object recognition, revealing how downstream neurons can flexibly access category information in diverse recognition tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) promotes myelin repair and plasticity in the mouse motor cortex",
      "content": "Cortical myelin loss and oligodendroglial dysfunction, hallmarks of numerous neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, compromise executive, sensory, and cognitive functions by altering circuit activity and integrity. Promoting cortical myelin repair therefore represents a critical therapeutic goal. In this frame, modulation of neuronal activity through non-invasive brain stimulation may represent a promising non-pharmacological approach to support remyelination. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS) in a mouse model of unilateral myelin injury in the motor cortex. A-tDCS was delivered over the contralateral uninjured cortex during a bilateral motor task (locomotion), to enhance the physiological activity of interhemispheric M1-M1 projections and indirectly stimulate the lesioned cortex. When applied during the late phase of demyelination and the onset of repair, A-tDCS accelerated remyelination and increased oligodendroglial survival and maturation in the lesioned cortex, compared with unstimulated controls. Increased myelin was also detected in the directly stimulated uninjured cortex despite unchanged oligodendroglial cell numbers, suggesting de novo myelin formation or remodeling of existing internodes. These structural changes were accompanied by preservation of interhemispheric M1-M1 functional connectivity upon injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that A-tDCS promotes cortical myelin repair in vivo, supporting its therapeutic potential for disorders characterized by myelin damage. Notably, the observed effects of tDCS on myelin plasticity in the uninjured cortex - reported here for the first time - reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying tDCS-mediated neuromodulation.",

      "content": "Bioluminescent calcium sensors have unique uses in neuroscience and neuroengineering, enabling noninvasive imaging of neuronal activity and contactless activation of opsin-expressing neurons. However, the speed, range, and robustness of non-invasive imaging and rewiring or neuronal activity are limited by the radiance and dynamic range of existing bioluminescent calcium sensors. Here, we report the stepwise engineering of improved cyan-excitable red fluorescent proteins (mCyRFP4 and dCyRFP4), an improved red bioluminescent protein based on NanoLuc and CyRFP4 (Antares3), and an improved bioluminescent calcium sensor based on Antares3 (CaMBI3). Antares3 is 3-fold brighter than its predecessor, while CaMBI3 responds with an overall dynamic range of 24-fold, enabling high-sensitivity detection of calcium dynamics in muscle and neuronal tissues in vivo. Finally, a CaMBI3 variant and a red-shifted opsin ChRmine enabled red photon-assisted synaptic transmission in C. elegans. CaMBI3 thus facilitates genetically targeted non-invasive imaging and rewiring of neural activity in living animals.",

      "title": "Temporal sequence geometry enables odor recognition and generalization",
      "content": "Animals encode sensory stimuli with precisely timed neural activity across modalities. For example, mice can rapidly recognize odors, independent of their concentration, using information relayed from their olfactory bulbs by complex spatiotemporal patterns of mitral and tufted cell (MTC) activity. Yet, it remains unknown how MTC activity patterns are structured, and what role precisely timed activity sequences play in guiding perception. Here we investigated the geometry of MTC odor tuning and the structure of odor response sequences by performing fast 2-photon calcium imaging of hundreds of MTCs with sub-sniff resolution. We constructed a space of MTC tuning using the pairwise correlations between MTC odor responses averaged over a sniff and discovered that odor specific sequential activity traversed this space in smooth, continuous trajectories. Further, we found that the early but not the later part of sequences carried concentration invariant information about odor identity. Finally, inspired by observation that neighboring MTCs in the tuning space are activated together in time independently of the odors presented, we propose a role of activity sequences in training the piriform cortex to learn perceptually generalizable odor representations. To test these ideas, we constructed and analyzed a computational model for sequence-based unsupervised training of synapses from MTCs to the piriform cortex, which revealed that sequential activity across the entire sniff permits perceptual generalization for novel odors, acting as a scaffold for learning relevant activity manifolds between networks.",

      "content": "Senescence of peripheral sensory neurons has recently been associated with increased nociceptive signalling and pain chronification. Whether this association is found across pain conditions and independent study settings remains to be investigated. In this study, we made use of publicly available whole-genome transcriptome data sets on rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue to investigate pain-related peripheral sensory neuron senescence across pain models and independent study settings. We focused on Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn2a (p16) expression levels as two widely-used senescence markers, and to explore their potential role in peripheral sensory neuron senescence. We found that Cdkn1a but not Cdkn2a RNA is significantly increased across different axotomy- and lesion-based neuropathic pain models, but less consistent in other pain models including inflammatory pain. We observed a sex-dependent effect of Cdkn1a upregulation following nerve injury, with significantly increased Cdkn1a RNA levels in DRG cells from female but not male rats. Lastly, Cdkn1a RNA levels are increased among all DRG neuronal subtypes, seem to reach their maximum three to seven days following nerve injury, and afterwards go back to baseline. These data suggest that Cdkn1a upregulation in DRG neurons is a widespread response to nerve injury that is found across independent study settings.",

      "title": "Cortical cognitive processing explains and predicts superior colliculus signals and timing of gaze shifts to multisensory targets.",
      "content": "When goal-directed movements are aimed toward multimodal stimuli, action planning differs compared to the unimodal case in both the spatial and temporal domains, as reflected in specific trends of behavioral response differences in the two conditions. This has been systematically reported in past behavioral and neurophysiological studies; however, a unified neurocognitive theory is yet to be proposed that explains all these findings together based on cognitive processes during the delay period. In our previous paper (Daemi, Harris, & Crawford, 2016) we modeled causal inference in order to determine the spatial location of the goal for saccade. Here, we extend this framework into 1) the temporal domain, and 2) the domain of neural signals. Specifically, we propose that confidence on selecting a winning plan, relative to other alternatives, should influence the timing of execution of the winning action plan, as reflected in known superior colliculus signals and the generated behavior. To model these concepts, we build upon our previous evidence-accumulation decision-making framework and compute an instantaneous measure of confidence based on the relative saliency of the winning motor plan compared to the alternate plans. A winning plan is only initiated when enough evidence is accumulated in its favor. This is realized by introducing an accumulative measure of confidence that integrates the instantaneous measure through time. A threshold is set on the accumulative confidence and a GO command is released whenever it reaches the threshold. We also formalize the computations of how this model may be neurally implemented in the brain, mainly in the projections between the superior colliculus (SC), the basal ganglia, and the cortex. This model produces simulations that replicate and explain several experimental multisensory observations. In the behavioral domain, our model shows how higher reaction times are predicted for multi-modal targets with higher reliability, or with higher spatial or temporal disparities, due to less confidence on a unique cause. In the neurophysiological domain, our model replicates the principal multisensory behaviors observed in SC neurons: 1) the dependence of SC neuronal activity on the spatial and temporal structure of cross-modal stimuli (i.e., spatial and temporal principles), 2) the inverse relationship between stimulus intensity and the magnitude of the elicited multisensory response (i.e., principle of inverse effectiveness). We have also simulated some novel predictions that could guide new experimental studies. Thus, our model provides a unified viewpoint to explain, for the first time, the effects of both spatial and temporal factors on reaction time variability for multisensory targets, and assigns each of these effects to a unique cognitive function upstream from sensorimotor transformations. Our model proposes cognitive significance for multisensory neural principles in SC, by linking them to how the cortex infers a causal structure and calculates confidence on its inference.",

      "content": "Single-cell sequencing has reshaped the research paradigm of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by revealing the heterogeneous transcriptional states of brain cells. Large single-cell cohort datasets, such as ROSMAP and SEA-AD, provide valuable atlases but primarily focus on RNA expression and chromatin accessibility, often overlooking the roles of RNA secondary structures. Although RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) are increasingly recognized as regulators of neurodegeneration, their interacting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain poorly understood. We analyzed multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets to investigate rG4-associated biological functions across AD-relevant cell types and transcriptional states. We discovered that rG4-binding RBPs (RG4BPs) directly regulate essential glial cell functions, which are frequently impaired in AD. At the transcriptional state level, distinct sets of dysregulated RG4BPs correspond to the impaired state-specific biological features of astrocytes and microglia during AD progression, including a shift from an acute protective state to a chronic stress-associated state. This progressive state transition is accompanied by glial exhaustion and accumulated rG4s, which ultimately compromise glial support functions. We report several RG4BPs that are known regulators, including CIRBP, HSP90AA1, VIM, and PICALM, whose altered expression is associated with either pathological activation or severe functional impairment.

Neuroactive substances like nicotine can disrupt this balance and hyperactivate dopaminergic circuits, with combined effects on behavior and neural activity. We use Drosophila larvae to examine nicotine-induced, linked behavioral changes over multiple time scales by integrating high-resolution locomotor analysis with genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Acute nicotine exposure produces concentration-dependent hyperactivity. Manipulations of the dopaminergic system establish dopamine as the main mediator for motor responses, and further exploration establishes the {gamma} lobe of the mushroom body as a key site for nicotine integration. Experiments with long-term and repetitive nicotine exposure suggest sustained circuit excitability. Finally, nicotine exposure history induces nicotine preference, highlighting experience-dependent plasticity contributing to addiction-like behaviors. These results help establish the Drosophila larva as a model organism to elucidate how neuroactive substances reconfigure neural circuits and behavior.",
