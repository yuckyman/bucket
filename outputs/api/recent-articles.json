      "title": "Patterns of Brain Activation and Hippocampal Functional Connectivity Supporting Verbal Memory in Midlife Women",
      "content": "Women show declines in verbal memory across the menopause transition that may persist into the postmenopause. The goal of the present study was to characterize the patterns of brain activity and hippocampal functional connectivity that support verbal memory performance in midlife postmenopausal women. The study sample included 171 midlife postmenopausal women from the MsBrain I study (mean age = 59.3 years, mean education= 15.7 years, 87.7% white). All participants were cognitively normal, native English speakers, not taking menopausal hormone therapy. Participants completed neuropsychological (California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]) and neuroimaging assessments, including an fMRI task of verbal encoding and recognition. Findings indicated that during verbal encoding, greater activation of bilateral prefrontal and medial temporal regions, as well as the precuneus, cuneus, caudate, and cerebellar regions, was associated with better performance on CVLT measures, including learning, short- and long-delay recall, and semantic clustering. Functional connectivity from both hippocampi to primarily right prefrontal regions during verbal encoding associated with better CVLT performance. In-scanner word recognition accuracy was more strongly associated with activation of parietal and occipital regions, and with functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral parietal and temporal regions. Our findings characterize the patterns underlying verbal memory abilities in midlife postmenopausal women. The patterns identified here may act as a foundation for better interpreting the effects of hormonal changes and menopausal symptoms on cognition at midlife, and for identifying neural targets for pharmacological and lifestyle interventions aimed at sustaining women's memory function.",

      "title": "Single cell transcriptomics reveals enrichment of aggregation-prone alpha-synuclein isoforms across synucleinopathies",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Dysregulated expression of its encoding gene, SNCA, has been identified in association with both PD and DLB in short-read sequencing studies. However, such studies do not capture variation in transcript isoforms expressed. Here we combine for the first time SNCA-targeted long-read multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-Iso-seq) with unbiased short-read single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq for simultaneous characterization of the SNCA transcript isoform landscape and mapping of isoform expression to specific cell types and subtypes in PD, DLB, and control sample cortical tissues. This approach enabled discovery of numerous SNCA transcript isoforms displaying novel splicing patterns and incorporating novel exons. We further identified an abundant class of transcript isoforms encoding a previously unreported a-Syn protein variant (a-Syn-115) and displaying increased proportional detection in excitatory neurons of PD and DLB tissues in comparison to controls. The proportion of these isoforms was found to be especially high within several specific glutamatergic neuron subtypes. In-depth characterization of the predicted structural and biochemical properties of a-Syn-115 using an in silico modeling approach revealed a greater aggregative affinity compared with canonical a-Syn-140, suggesting the potential for increased cytosolic a-Syn-115 abundance to induce aggregation between heterogeneous a-Syn isoforms, potentially driving fibril formation and disease progression. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a-Syn involvement in multiple synucleinopathies and have translational implications for the development of new precision medicine strategies to combat these diseases, indicating the potential for treatments targeting both specific transcript and protein isoforms, as well as disease-driving cell subtypes.",

      "content": "People segment ongoing information into meaningful mental representations known as events. Recent studies have found a spatio-temporal hierarchy in the event structure during movie watching and story listening. How the human brain segments stories while reading remains unclear. We examined event segmentation while reading Harry Potter using publicly available 3T fMRI data. To identify neural events, we employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) within six regions of interest (ROI) in the reading network. The ROIs included the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus orbital (IFGorb), anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and posterior temporal lobe (PTL). These regions are also associated with DMN. The results revealed multiple timescales of events, with the IFG and AG representing shorter events, while the IFGorb, ATL, PTL and MFG represent relatively longer events. Boundaries of longer events were partially aligned within short events, suggesting a nested hierarchical event structure. Further comparisons identified associations between neural events and annotations from humans and ChatGPT (automated and less subjective segmentation) in the inferior frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Notably, the AG (a core region of the DMN and memory processing) and the IFG (relevant for language processing) exhibited stronger alignment with both sets of annotations. The findings suggest an important role of AG and IFG in event segmentation in reading. They also confirm the connection between the reading network and the DMN in event segmentation. This connection seems to be linked to the hierarchical processing of context-dependent semantic information during reading.",

Here, we employed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq), combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), to map the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of adult mouse hippocampus under recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) treatment. We discovered significant lineage-specific remodelling of chromatin accessibility predominantly in newly formed pyramidal neurons, highlighting a robust EPO-driven neurogenic response. Notably, transposable elements (TEs), particularly ancient LINEs and SINEs, emerged as critical cis-regulatory elements extensively bound by key neurogenic transcription factors such as NEUROD1/2, FOXG1, and ASCL1. Integrative analyses revealed that these TE-derived regulatory elements orchestrate gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognised role of TEs as dynamic regulators in EPO-induced hippocampal re-wiring of gene regulatory networks associated with neurogenesis, establishing a valuable epigenomic resource for advancing therapeutic strategies targeting cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "title": "Towards decoding inner speech from EEG and MEG",
      "content": "Despite the prevalence of inner speech in everyday life, research on this has been limited, particularly when it comes to non-invasive methods. This preprint aims to fill this gap by using EEG and MEG to collect data from three different inner speech paradigms, and by conducting an initial decoding analysis. Specifically, we tested silent reading, repetitive inner speech, and generative inner speech tasks. We collect a high number of inner speech trials from a few participants. Besides comparing across recording modalities we also compare across inner speech types. Our aim is to analyse the decodability of inner speech within each task and between tasks by the use of transfer learning. We find that in both EEG and MEG, silent reading can be decoded relatively well with 30-40% accuracy across 5 words. However, the decoding performance of both types of inner speech is mostly at chance level. This prohibited further transfer learning investigations between tasks. While the inner speech results are primarily negative, we believe our exploration of data size and various decoding methods is valuable. The dataset itself is useful for the research community as it contains a much larger number of trials within one participant than any other inner speech dataset. Having multiple sessions also allows for testing across-session performance. Finally, we systematically compare silent reading decoding performance within 3 participants across four non-invasive modalities. These are EEG, 2 types of MEG machines, Elekta and CTF, and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). We also compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of silent reading between these modalities. This is especially aimed at validating OPMs as a new kind of non-invasive brain recording technology. We find comparable performance to EEG, but OPM performance did not reach traditional MEG.",

      "title": "PERINATAL ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANT EXPOSURE ALTERS ADULT HPA AXIS FUNCTION AND AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER IN MICE",
      "content": "Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are ubiquitous flame-retardant additives with endocrine-disrupting properties. Despite increasing evidence that OPFRs impact neurodevelopment, their effects on the neuroendocrine stress response remain poorly understood. To examine their long-term impact on stress regulation, we treated pregnant C57Bl/6J dams to a mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and tricresyl phosphate (TCP; 1 mg/kg each) from gestational day (GD) 7 through postnatal day (PND) 14. Adult offspring (8-9 weeks of age) were then challenged with acute stressors, including 1 h restraint or a 6-day acute variable stress (AVS) paradigm. Perinatal OPFR exposure produced persistent, sex-specific alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress-related neurocircuitry. Following 1 h restraint, OPFR-treated females showed heightened serum corticosterone. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed sex-dependent disruptions in key stress-regulatory pathways after OPFR treatment and 1 h restraint in the hypothalamus (Crhr1, Crhr2, Ptpn5) and pituitary (Crhr1, Pomc, Nr3c1). Females demonstrated more differences in adrenal gene expression related to steroidogenesis (Mc2r, Cyp11b2) and catecholamine biosynthesis (Dbh, Pnmt), with OPFR-treated groups having blunted responses. OPFR AVS females displayed reduced corticosterone and downregulated Pacap/Pac1r expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), accompanied by increased behavioral avoidance and immobility. In males, OPFR exposure led to increased BNST Pacap and Pac1r, expression, along with hyperactivity and avoidance behaviors. Together, these findings demonstrate that early-life OPFR exposure induces lasting, sex-specific dysregulation of the HPA axis and associated stress circuits, highlighting OPFRs as developmental neuroendocrine disruptors with implications for mood and stress-related disorders.",

      "title": "The SNCA A53T mutation sensitizes human neurons and microglia to ferroptosis",
      "content": "The major pathological hallmarks of sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the targeted and progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDA), associated with systemic iron accumulation, a-synuclein (asyn) accumulation and aggregation, and lipid peroxidation amongst other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Therapeutic strategies aimed towards dopamine restoration, asyn removal and iron chelation have provided symptomatic relief but failed to prevent or slow disease progression. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the exact pathways leading to neuronal death in PD. In this study, we investigate ferroptosis, a unique cell death mechanism sharing multiple features with PD pathology, as a relevant pathway with implications in disease pathogenesis. We identified an enrichment of ferroptosis genes dysregulated throughout PD postmortem brain samples and several neuronal and glial PD models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a rapid iPSC-derived synucleinopathy neuronal model harbouring the SNCA A53T mutation and report increased ROS generation, reduced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH), impaired mitophagy and a heightened vulnerability to ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death. Critically, inhibition of the key lipid peroxidation enzyme and driver of ferroptosis, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), rescued synucleinopathy associated pathologies and prevented pathological asyn oligomerisation in SNCA A53T neurons. Furthermore, we report enhanced microglial ferroptosis susceptibility in models of synucleinopathy. In summary, we highlight a new mechanism by which the familial PD-associated SNCA A53T mutation causes cell death and propose 15-LO inhibition as a tractable therapeutic opportunity in PD.",

      "title": "Slow Intrinsic Oscillations in the Ventrolateral Preoptic nucleus",
      "content": "The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) of the hypothalamus plays a major role in the induction and consolidation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. While VLPO neurons are heterogeneous, they often display low-threshold spikes (LTS), a feature that supports rhythmic activity. Nevertheless, rhythmic bursting in these VLPO neurons has never been observed. Here, we report that ~12% of VLPO neurons in a large database of ex vivo patch-clamp recordings display spontaneous rhythmic bursting of action potentials. This activity occurred in putative sleep-promoting neurons, identified by inhibitory responses to noradrenaline (NA), as well as wake-active neurons that were activated by NA. Unsupervised clustering of 24 neurons based on burst properties, electrophysiological, and morphological features revealed three distinct groups: one corresponding to putative sleep-promoting neurons and two wake-active neurons with fast and slow bursting dynamics. Strikingly, membrane potential oscillations persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that rhythmic bursting is driven by intrinsic mechanisms rather than network activity. These findings suggest that rhythmic bursting is an intrinsic and functionally relevant mode of activity in VLPO neurons, which may contribute to sleep regulation.",

      "title": "WFS1E864K in humans and mice causes Wolfram-like syndrome optic atrophy via early axonal mitochondrial dysfunction",
      "content": "Wolfram-like syndrome leads to retinal ganglion cell degeneration and vision loss. Wolfram-like syndrome is primarily caused by variants in the WFS1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein, Wolframin. To date, the disease mechanism remains unclear, and no therapies are available. Here, we generated a mouse model carrying the pathogenic WFS1E864K allele that recapitulated key features of human Wolfram-like syndrome, including bilateral optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber thinning and lamination of the outer plexiform layer. We demonstrated, using the Wfs1E864K mouse model, that alteration of the protein leads to impairments of retinal ganglion cell function, associated with a thinning of the inner retina layer and nerve fibers. These alterations are associated with myelin disorganization, axonal death, mitochondrial alterations in the axons, and impairment of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication in the soma. Our data showed that primary deficits are localized in the optic nerve before progressing towards the retinal ganglion cell soma. RNAseq analysis identified several altered signaling pathways such as in lipid metabolism, glia activation response, metabolic stress, organelle transport and quality control. These findings highlighted the critical role of Wolframin in optic nerve mitochondrial physiology, providing us with a pertinent model to develop novel innovative therapeutic strategies.",
