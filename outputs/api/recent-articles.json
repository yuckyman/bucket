      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

      "content": "Data suggests that the available therapeutic tools are still insufficient to deal with suicidality. Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation techniques (NIBS) have entered the recognized guidelines for therapies in psychiatry due to the advantages related to safety and tolerability. The purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to assess if and how NIBS techniques are used and could be effective in the treatment of suicidal ideation. The search included the Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases....",

Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) and core stability exercises have shown promise in enhancing motor control and biomechanical alignment, but their combined effects on DKV remain unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of active versus sham tDCS combined with core stability exercises on knee kinematic alignment...",

Both Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Non-invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) have shown significant potential in facilitating motor recovery in stroke patients. The combination of BCI and NIBS enhances brain functional reorganization and accelerates motor recovery post-stroke through a real-time feedback mechanism. By modulating neural plasticity, this combined approach can alter the trajectory of motor...",

      "content": "Sexual violence includes a wide variety of behaviors, ranging from harassment to coercion, to rape, to sexual homicide. Although the criminal justice system distinguishes these forms of sexual violence, several studies have suggested that they represent different degrees of severity of an underlying continuum, named the Agonistic Continuum. Such model proposes that sub-categories of sexual violence share a core, unifying construct. The aim of the present study was to develop and test the...",
