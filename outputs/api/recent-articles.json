      "title": "Exploring Implicit Perspectives on Autism in Large Language Models Through Multi-Agent Simulations",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15412v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mental health concerns are rising globally, prompting increased reliance on technology to address the demand-supply gap in mental health services. In particular, mental health chatbots are emerging as a promising solution, but these remain largely untested, raising concerns about safety and potential harms. In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.\n  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.\n  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.\n  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended Reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, provides immersive and interactive experiences across diverse applications, from VR-based education to AR-based assistance and MR-based training. However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.",

Informal texts hide dependencies, while formal systems expose every detail in ways that are not always human-readable. Dependency graphs offer a middle ground by making visible the structure of results, definitions, and proofs. We present KnowTeX, a standalone, user-friendly tool that extends the ideas of Lean's Blueprints, enabling the visualization of conceptual dependencies directly from LaTeX sources. Using a simple \"uses\" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems.",

This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy. We also analyse differences between disability types. These results provide critical insights into the potential of social robots to mitigate accessibility barriers in higher education, while highlighting ethical, social and technical challenges.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diabetes is a significant and continuously rising health challenge in Indonesia. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as \"black boxes,\" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15291v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Independent navigation is a core aspect of maintaining social participation and individual health for vulnerable populations. While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence. Our analysis highlights the importance of dynamic tools in terms of sensory and cognitive needs to meaningfully improve independent travel.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15290v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15530v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15689v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Volitional memory control supports adaptive cognition by enabling intentional Recall of goal-relevant information and Suppression of unwanted memories. While neural mechanisms underlying Recall and Suppression have been studied largely in isolation, less is known about the large-scale brain networks supporting these processes under competing cognitive demands, particularly as a function of subclinical anxiety. Here, we examined control of emotionally valenced memories during directed Recall and Suppression while 47 participants concurrently performed an independent visual working memory task. Cognitive control efficiency was quantified using the Balanced Integration Score (BIS), and seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was used to characterize intrinsic network organization. Dissociable rsFC profiles were associated with memory control efficiency across emotional valences and were selectively moderated by anxiety. More efficient Suppression of positive memories was linked to reduced connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior perceptual-midline regions, as well as diminished hippocampal-frontal pole coupling. In contrast, efficient Suppression of negative memories was associated with increased connectivity between posterior parietal and lateral occipital regions. Anxiety moderated relationships between cognitive efficiency and prefrontal connectivity during Suppression of positive memories and Recall of positive and neutral memories. Direct comparisons further revealed stronger hippocampal-thalamic rsFC during Suppression relative to Recall of positive memories. Together, these findings delineate the functional brain architecture supporting volitional control of emotional memories under cognitive load and demonstrate that anxiety severity selectively shapes these network-level mechanisms across the anxiety continuum.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15462v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Strong, correlated noise in recurrent neural circuits often passes through nonlinear transfer functions, complicating dynamical mean-field analyses of complex phenomena such as transients and bifurcations. We introduce a method that replaces nonlinear functions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise with a Gaussian-equivalent process matched in mean and covariance, and combine this with a lognormal moment closure for expansive nonlinearities to derive a closed dynamical mean-field theory for recurrent neuronal networks. The resulting theory captures order-one transients, fixed points, and noise-induced shifts of bifurcation structure, and outperforms standard linearization-based approximations in the strong-fluctuation regime. More broadly, the approach applies whenever dynamics depend smoothly on OU processes via nonlinear transformations, offering a tractable route to noise-dependent phase diagrams in computational neuroscience models.",

      "title": "A Dual-Head Transformer-State-Space Architecture for Neurocircuit Mechanism Decomposition from fMRI",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15344v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precision psychiatry aspires to elucidate brain-based biomarkers of psychopathology to bolster disease risk assessment and treatment development. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has helped triangulate brain circuits whose functional features are correlated with or even predictive of forms of psychopathology. Yet, fMRI biomarkers to date remain largely descriptive identifiers of where, rather than how, neurobiology is aberrant, limiting their utility for guiding treatment. We present a method for decomposing fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) into constituent biomechanisms - output drive, input responsivity, modulator gating - with clearer alignment to differentiable therapeutic interventions. Neurocircuit mechanism decomposition (NMD) integrates (i) a graph-constrained, lag-aware transformer to estimate directed, pathway-specific routing distributions and drive signals, with (ii) a measurement-aware state-space model (SSM) that models hemodynamic convolution and recovers intrinsic latent dynamics. This dual-head architecture yields interpretable circuit parameters that may provide a more direct bridge from fMRI to treatment strategy selection. We instantiate the model in an anatomically and electrophysiologically well-defined circuit: the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.",

      "title": "Learning Discrete Successor Transitions in Continuous Attractor Networks: Emergence, Limits, and Topological Constraints",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15336v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are a well-established class of models for representing low-dimensional continuous variables such as head direction, spatial position, and phase. In canonical spatial domains, transitions along the attractor manifold are driven by continuous displacement signals, such as angular velocity-provided by sensorimotor systems external to the CAN itself. When such signals are not explicitly provided as dedicated displacement inputs, it remains unclear whether attractor-based circuits can reliably acquire recurrent dynamics that support stable state transitions, or whether alternative predictive strategies dominate.\n  In this work, we present an experimental framework for training CANs to perform successor-like transitions between stable attractor states in the absence of externally provided displacement signals. We compare two recurrent topologies, a circular ring and a folded snake manifold, and systematically vary the temporal regime under which stability is evaluated. We find that, under short evaluation windows, networks consistently converge to impulse-driven associative solutions that achieve high apparent accuracy yet lack persistent attractor dynamics. Only when stability is explicitly enforced over extended free-run periods do genuine attractor-based transition dynamics emerge. This suggests that shortcut solutions are the default outcome of local learning in recurrent networks, while attractor dynamics represent a constrained regime rather than a generic result.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate that topology strictly limits the capacity for learned transitions. While the continuous ring topology achieves perfect stability over long horizons, the folded snake topology hits a geometric limit characterized by failure at manifold discontinuities, which neither curriculum learning nor basal ganglia-inspired gating can fully overcome.",

We investigate the recalibration in EEG networks that causes this change and the track the timeline of changes in the auditory processing pathway. Our results obtained using network analysis, non-stationary time series analysis and multivariate pattern classification show that recalibration takes place early in the auditory processing pathway and the after-effect decays with time after exposure to the illusion.",

Local neural or cognitive functions are represented as sections of a sheaf, while global coherence corresponds to the existence of global sections. Brain pathologies are interpreted as obstructions to such global integration and are classified using tools from sheaf cohomology. The framework builds on the neural manifold program in contemporary neuroscience and on standard results in sheaf theory, and is further interpreted through a Leibnizian lens \\cite{Churchland2012, Leibniz1714, MacLaneMoerdijk, Perich2025}.

      "title": "Large Language Models as Simulative Agents for Neurodivergent Adult Psychometric Profiles",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15319v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adult neurodivergence, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), is marked by substantial symptom overlap that limits the discriminant sensitivity of standard psychometric instruments. While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints.",

      "title": "Beyond the Einstein-Bohr Debate: Cognitive Complementarity and the Emergence of Quantum Intuition",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15314v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent high-precision experimental confirmations of quantum complementarity have revitalized foundational debates about measurement, description, and realism. This article argues that complementarity is most productively interpreted as an epistemic principle--constraining what can be simultaneously accessed and represented--rather than as an ontological claim about quantum reality. Reexamining the Einstein-Bohr debate through this lens reveals a persistent tension between descriptive completeness and contextual meaning, a tension experiments clarify but do not dissolve. Building on this analysis, we introduce cognitive complementarity as a structural principle governing reasoning under non-classical uncertainty, where mutually constraining representations cannot be jointly optimized. Within this framework, we propose quantum intuition as a testable cognitive capacity: the ability to sustain representational plurality, regulate commitment timing, and resolve perspective-incompatibilities in a context-sensitive manner. Formulated as a naturalistic construct grounded in shared informational constraints, quantum intuition offers a principled bridge between quantum measurement theory and cognition. This work reframes the historical debate, extends epistemic lessons from quantum foundations into cognitive science, and outlines empirical pathways for studying decision-making in contexts of irreducible uncertainty.",

      "title": "Mind the Gap: Why Neural Memory Fails Under Semantic Density",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15313v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The brain solves a problem that current AI architectures struggle to manage: storing specific episodic facts without corrupting general semantic knowledge. Neuroscience explains this through Complementary Learning Systems theory - a fast hippocampal system for episodic storage using pattern-separated representations, and a slow neocortical system for extracting statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the 'Stability Gap' in online neural memory: fast-weight mechanisms that write facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), we show collapse occurs with as few as N=5 facts at high density (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 at moderate density - a phenomenon we formalise as the Orthogonality Constraint. This failure persists even with perfect attention and unlimited context, arising from write-time interference when storage and retrieval share the same substrate. We also identify schema drift and version ambiguity as primary failure modes in production systems, observing 40-70% schema consistency and 0-100% clean correction rates. Context-based memory incurs 30-300% cost premium over selective retrieval. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): discrete, typed memory units with controlled vocabularies and explicit version chains. Paired with neural weights, KOs enable a true complementary learning architecture, suggesting reliable AI memory may require this bicameral design.",
