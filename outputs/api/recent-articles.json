      "title": "Microbes in the Moonlight: How the Gut Microbiota Influences Sleep",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02766v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes",

      "title": "A switch in arousal circuit architecture shapes sleep across the lifespan",
      "content": "Sleep is a continuous behavior across the lifespan, yet its features and functions evolve markedly with development. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, early life sleep differs from mature sleep, but it is unknown whether disparate sleep regulatory mechanisms underlie these changes. Here, we identify distinct populations of octopaminergic (OA) neurons that promote arousal in larval and adult flies, thus revealing a developmental switch in sleep-wake circuit architecture. Of eight OA neurons present in the sub-esophageal zone (SEZ) of the nervous system at both life stages, dedicated, non-overlapping subsets drive arousal in larvae versus adults. Morphologic and connectomic analyses show that larval OA arousal neurons project primarily to the ventral nerve cord and lack substantial sensory input, suggesting a circuit logic optimized for internally driven arousal during early development. In contrast, adult OA arousal neurons target higher brain regions involved in cognition and receive rich multimodal sensory input, supporting wakefulness in response to environmental cues. These findings highlight a developmental transition in arousal circuitry that mirrors changing ecological demands, with juvenile systems organized to prioritize growth and feeding, insulated from sensory disturbance, and mature systems supporting sensory-guided behavior. Our results support a model of sleep regulation as a developmentally dynamic process, in which shared neuromodulators like OA operate through distinct cellular substrates tailored to life stage-specific behavioral priorities.",

      "title": "Embodied Navigation: whole-body movement drives path integration in large-scale free-walking virtual reality",
      "content": "Human navigation relies on combining body cues (vestibular and proprioceptive signals) with visual cues such as optic flow. The weighting and integration of these signals during the continuous tracking of walked distances and angles, known as path integration, remain poorly understood. Previous path integration studies have been limited to small spaces (<150 m2) and the influence of complex environments on cue weighting of body and vision cues is still unclear. Here, we conducted the largest-environment free-walking virtual reality navigation study to date in a 45x25 m facility (1,215 m2) using triangle completion tasks in naturalistic environments. We systematically manipulated sensory input across three conditions: natural active walking (full sensory integration), active joystick control (visual cues only), and blindfolded active walking (body cues only). Participants navigated through both sparse fallow land without trees and more complex forest environments with 400 trees. We embedded performance data in a Bayesian cue combination model to analyse the underlying combination mechanism. Our results provide evidence that most participants substantially favour body cues over visual cues in a non-Bayesian combination process, with considerable inter-individual variance in cue dominance strength and side biases. While transitioning from fallow land to forests reduced directional variance, weighting of body and visual information remained constant. These findings advance our understanding of human spatial navigation by demonstrating that body-based cues dominate path integration even in visually rich, large-scale environments, challenging assumptions about optimal Bayesian cue integration in human navigation.",

      "title": "Early Sleep-Dependent Sensory Gating in the Olfactory System",
      "content": "Disconnection from the external world is a defining feature of sleep. Although most models attribute sensory gating to thalamocortical mechanisms, the olfactory system-bypassing the thalamus-offers a unique window into earlier stages of sensory disconnection. Here, we combine chronic and acute recordings in rodents to test whether nasal sensory inputs are internalized during sleep. We show that respiration-locked potentials and gamma activity in the olfactory bulb are strongly modulated by brain state: they diminish during sleep and reappear during wakefulness and cortical activation. This gating occurs independently of respiratory dynamics and arises near the first synapse of the olfactory pathway. Finally, we find that neocortical slow-wave activity correlates with reduced olfactory entrainment, with coupling progressively vanishing as sleep deepens. These findings reveal a sleep-dependent sensory gating mechanism at early stages of a non-thalamic pathway, providing new insights into the neural substrates of sensory disconnection during sleep.",
