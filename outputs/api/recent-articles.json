      "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

      "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
      "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

      "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
      "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

      "title": "Metallothionein III Mediates Ca2+-Dependent Zn2+ Spikes to Inhibit Dendritic Arborization",
      "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Vocal communication is a complex social behavior that entails the integration of auditory perception and vocal production. Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",
