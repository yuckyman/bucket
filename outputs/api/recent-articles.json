      "title": "The Bone Morphogenetic Pathway Controls the Uptake of Infectious Prions",
      "content": "Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders caused by the spread of misfolded prion protein between cells and individuals, yet the paths by which prions colonize cells are undefined. Here we map the determinants of prion uptake with a genome-wide quadruple-guide CRISPR activation screen. Uptake of prions was measured by flow cytometry in PRNP-ablated human SHSY-5Y cells exposed to synthetic ovine prions. We identified 43 genes modulating prion uptake, 6 of which belonged to the core components of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling axis. Prion internalization was increased by overexpression of BMP receptors (BMPR1B, BMPR2, ACVRL1) and the Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD1 and SMAD5) intracellular BMP effectors, whereas the inhibitory SMAD6 reduced it. The internalization of other proteopathic seeds (-synuclein, tau K18, amyloid-{beta}) and other endocytic probes (transferrin, dextran, E. coli bioparticles) was unaffected. Transcriptional profiles of a panel of persistently prion-infected cell lines showed broad dysregulation of BMP-related signaling. Hence, BMP signaling is a gatekeeper of prion entry mechanistically distinct from bulk endocytosis and amyloid uptake. Chronic prion propagation induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, suggesting a positive-feedback loop during prion infection. The connection of prion uptake to a developmentally conserved morphogen pathway with rich pharmacology suggests that BMP signaling nodes may serve as tractable levers to modulate early events in prion transmission.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

Microglia-specific RIPK3 knockout (KO) mice were employed to establish retinal IR models. Retinal structural and functional status was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining along with electroretinogram. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was employed to detect the situations of...",
