If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "title": "Social bodies: Preliminary evidence that awareness of embodied emotions is associated with recognition of emotions in the bodily cues of others.",
      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Vicarious trauma-witnessing serious harm to others-produces systemic neuroimmune effects in animal models. However, its brain, autonomic, and immune consequences in humans remain unclear. We scanned 88 participants with fMRI during a naturalistic movie-viewing paradigm depicting either industrial cruelty to farm animals (Vicarious Trauma, VT) or positive human-animal interactions (Vicarious Community, VC) with concurrent autonomic physiology and gene expression in circulating monocytes. VT, compared to VC, evoked sustained sympathetic arousal lasting 40 minutes post-viewing and primed innate immune cells to elicit elevated pro-inflammatory (upregulating IL1B and CXCL8) and reduced anti-inflammatory (TGFB1) responses. VT reduced integration in a frontoparietal control system and increased coupling between a salience/action-mode system with paralimbic, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor regions. Disrupted negative coupling between frontoparietal/default-mode and hippocampal systems predicted VT-related CXCL8 increases. These findings shed light on how the brain translates vicarious trauma into the priming of innate immunity.",

      "title": "Atypical somatosensory adaptation in adults on the autism spectrum: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping study.",
      "content": "Adaptation to repetitive sensory inputs promotes efficient neural processing by attenuating responses to redundant information and reallocating resources to novel stimuli. Reduced adaptation has been proposed to contribute to atypical sensory reactivity in autism, but the physiological mechanisms underlying tactile adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we examined short-term adaptation to repetitive vibrotactile stimulation in autistic and neurotypical adults using high-density electrophysiological recordings. Fifty participants (18-44 years; 25 autistic; 25 neurotypical), received sequences of four brief vibrations to the index fingertip while viewing silent videos. Neural responses were analyzed for an early negative deflection (N1, ~100 milliseconds) indexing basic stimulus recognition, and a later positive deflection (P2, ~200-300 milliseconds) indexing higher-order contextual and attentional processing. Adaptation was quantified as changes in response magnitude across the four vibrations. The N1 did not differ between groups, showing minimal change across repetitions, indicating comparable processing of basic tactile features. In contrast, the P2 was significantly larger overall in the autistic group. Across both groups, responses to the first vibration in each sequence were greater than responses to subsequent vibrations, reflecting re-sensitization following the inter-sequence interval. Autistic participants exhibited consistently amplified P2 responses to initial vibrations, suggesting heightened re-sensitization rather than impaired within-sequence adaptation. Associations between neural responses and clinical measures of autistic traits and tactile sensitivity were modest. These findings indicate that autistic adults show amplified higher-order neural responses to tactile input alongside preserved short-term adaptation. Heightened re-sensitization to repeated touch may reflect shortened refractory periods, contributing to sensory hyper-reactivity and increased perceptual load.",

      "title": "Cortical Thickness and Curvature in Autism and ADHD: A Mega-Analysis",
      "content": "Background: Existing evidence suggests cortical morphometric alterations occur in people with autism and ADHD. However, these findings remain tentative due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous imaging pipelines, varied statistical approaches, and limited harmonization across acquisition sites. Few studies have applied standardized processing to large, clinically enriched datasets or addressed site-related batch effects. Methods: We leveraged six large-scale brain imaging datasets (n = 9,647; male=5,835; female=3,812; ages 5-64 years), including 1,533 individuals with ADHD, 1,080 with autism spectrum disorder, and 7,034 matched controls. All imaging data were processed using the validated ABCD-HCP pipeline, with cortical parcellation into 360 regions based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, and ComBat harmonization was applied to account for variability across 67 acquisition sites. Group-level differences in cortical thickness and sulcal curvature were examined with ANCOVAs, controlling for covariates and using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analyses revealed distinct neuroanatomical signatures for both autism and ADHD. Individuals with autism exhibited regionally thinner cortex and curvature alterations particularly in the Cingulo-Opercular network. In contrast, individuals with ADHD displayed regionally thicker cortex, particularly in the default mode and somatomotor networks, alongside curvature differences. Control participants showed intermediate patterns, suggesting that autism and ADHD may represent diverging extremes of cortical maturation. Conclusions: Cortical thickness and curvature emerge as potential biomarkers that can advance understanding of neurodevelopmental conditions and disentangle heterogeneity across diagnostic groups. These findings highlight the value of harmonized, large-scale, standardized analyses for resolving inconsistencies in the literature.",

      "content": "Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide and is associated with substantial pain and mental health burden, yet its neurobiological correlates remain poorly characterized. Neuroimaging studies of endometriosis are particularly limited. Here we present a comprehensive, multidimensional investigation of the neurobiology of endometriosis, integrating structural and diffusion neuroimaging, biofluid measures, neuropsychological testing, and detailed health and psychosocial phenotyping in individuals with and without endometriosis. Compared with controls, individuals with endometriosis exhibited higher levels of pain, depression, and anxiety and performed worse across multiple cognitive domains. Global and regional brain morphometric measures did not differ between groups; however, endometriosis-specific pain was associated with altered gray matter volume and white matter microstructure across distributed pain-related neural circuits. These findings identify pain-related neurobiological signatures of endometriosis and establish a foundation for mechanistic and translational studies of its central nervous system effects.",
