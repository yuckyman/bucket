      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Parsers start in a supervised mode where document types are validated by an LLM only when confidence is low (with a carefully monitored audit log\u2014helps balance speed with processing hundreds or thousands of bills for the first run).</p> <p>As a pattern becomes stable within a particular context (e.g., a specific committee), it \u201cgraduates\u201d to autonomous operation.</p> <p>This cuts LLM usage out entirely after patterns are established.</p> <ol> <li>A declarative action-node system</li> </ol> <p>Each event type is defined by:</p> <ul> <li>regex patterns</li> <li>extractor functions</li> <li>normalizers</li> <li>and optional priority weights</li> </ul> <p>Adding a new event type requires registering patterns, not modifying core engine code.</p> <ol> <li>A timeline engine with tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>The engine reconstructs \u201dtenure windows\u201d (who had custody of a bill when), by modeling event sequences such as referrals, discharges, reports, hearings, and extensions.</p> <p>This allows accurate downstream logic such as:</p> <ul> <li>notice windows</li> <li>action deadlines</li> <li>gap detection</li> <li>duration calculations</li> </ul> <ol> <li>A high-performance decaying URL cache</li> </ol> <p>The HTTP layer uses a memory-bounded hybrid LRU/LFU eviction strategy (`hit_count / time_since_access`) with request deduplication and ETag/Last-Modified validation.</p> <p>This speeds up repeated processing by ~3-5x.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This project is intended for:</p> <ul> <li>developers working with messy, unstructured, real-world text data</li> <li>engineers designing parser pipelines, state machines, or ETL systems</li> <li>researchers experimenting with pattern extraction, timeline reconstruction, or document normalization</li> <li>anyone interested in building declarative, extensible parsing systems</li> <li>civic-tech or open-data engineers (OpenStates-style pipelines)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most existing alternatives (e.g., OpenStates, BillTrack, general-purpose scrapers) extract events for normalization and reporting, but don\u2019t (to my knowledge) evaluate these events against a ruleset. This approach works for tracking bill events as they\u2019re updated, but doesn\u2019t yield enough data to reliably evaluate committee-level deadline compliance (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t their intended purpose anyway).</p> <p>How this project differs:</p> <ol> <li>Timeline-first architecture</li> </ol> <p>Rather than detecting events in isolation, it reconstructs a full chronological sequence and applies logic after timeline creation.</p> <ol> <li>Declarative parser configuration</li> </ol> <p>New event and document types can be added by registering patterns; no engine modification required.</p> <ol> <li>Context-aware inference</li> </ol> <p>Missing committee/dates are inferred from prior context (e.g., latest referral), not left blank.</p> <ol> <li>Confidence-gated parser graduation</li> </ol> <p>Parsers statistically \u201clearn\u201d which contexts they succeed in, and reduce LLM/manual interaction over time.</p> <ol> <li>Formal tenure modeling</li> </ol> <p>Custody analysis allows logic that would be extremely difficult in a traditional scraper.</p> <p>In short, this isn\u2019t a keyword matcher, rather, it\u2019s a state machine for real-world text with an adaptive parsing pipeline built around it and a ruleset engine for calculating and applying deadline evaluations.</p> <p><strong>Code / Docs</strong></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/\">https://github.com/arbowl/beacon-hill-compliance-tracker/</a></p> <p><strong>Looking for Feedback</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d love feedback from Python engineers who have experience with:</p> <ul> <li>parser design</li> <li>messy-data ETL pipelines</li> <li>declarative rule systems</li> <li>timeline/state-machine architectures</li> <li>document normalization and caching</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeaconHillTracker\"> /u/BeaconHillTracker </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pevr3n/built_a_legislature_tracker_featuring_a_state/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids and Rutin Against Inflammation on a Huntington Animal Model",
      "content": "This study tested the hypothesis that flavonoids (diosmine, hesperidin and rutin(R)) play a protective role in the brain and duodenum against 3-NPA's free radical induced inflammation. This was achieved by measuring the levels of GABA, 5-HIAA, dopamine and some inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Male young Wistar rats (weight 60g) received Salmonella thyphimurium ATCC14028 1x106 CFU/g every week, for two consecutive weeks, plus the following treatments: group A, 9% NaCl 0. (Control); group B, diomine (300mg) + hesperidin (33.3g) + rutin (150mg/kg); group C, 3-NPA; group D, 3-NPA + mix of flavonoids with 1ml of rutin(R) per rat. 3-NPA administration was at 24mg/kgW by intraperitoneal route and the flavonoids were orally administered at every 48 hours for 15 days. At the moment of euthanasia, the blood was obtained to assess Interleukine-6, glucose, triglycerides and hemoglobin levels. Brain and duodenum were obtained to measure GABA, dopamine, 5-HIAA, lipoperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), total ATPase concentrations and catalase activity using validated methods. The brains, stomach and duodenum were dissected for histological analysis. In group A, there is a decrease in interleukine-6 levels (p=0.009). In the cortex region of animals in group C, dopamine experienced a significant decrease (p=0.012). GABA increased (p=0.001) in cerebellum regions of animals in the groups A, B and C. ATPase activity increased (p = 0.013) in cerebellum regions in animals of groups C and D. Lipoperoxidation diminished (p=0.043) in cerebellum region of group D. Catalase activity diminished (p=0.043) in Cortex region of animals in groups B and D, and (p=0.002) in cerebellum region of animals in groups A and B. Besides, histological changes revealed marked lesions of neuronal cells in experimental animals treated with nitro propionic acid. The protective role of flavonoids and rutin compounds on inhibition of the inflammatory response and correction of the fundamental oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in animals suffering from Huntington diseases are important vistas for further research.",

      "title": "Functional Connectivity Graph Theory Analysis of Spoken Word Processing Efficiency in Prefrontal Cortical Activation",
      "content": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and graph theory analysis of functional connectivity measures derived from hemodynamic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can characterize spoken word processing efficiency in neurotypical listeners. Individual differences were assessed by identifying a low performing (Low-P) and a high performing (High-P) individual. Network science and psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition predict that word frequency and sublexical phonotactic probability of the word form affects the cognitive processing effort. This novel study assesses predictors of processing efficiency directly using functional connectivity measures of global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity, and hubness, derived from listener's frontal lobe hemodynamic response function during a verbal working memory task. Method: A total of 20 neurologically typical participants (ages 18-21) completed an auditory working memory task where participants were required to hold words differing word frequency and sub lexical phonotactic probability in memory. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration were recorded with a continuous-wave, multi-channel fNIRS system (TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) using a 20-channel optode montage across the prefrontal cortex. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between each channel pair to produce 20x20 functional connectivity matrices. Frontal networks were constructed as a graph where nodes in the graph are the light source and edges are connections (e.g., channels) between nodes. Functional connectivity strength and graph theory measures were examined. Results: LF and HF words were not processed differently at the behavioral or brain level. Task performance regardless of word frequency was related to brain measures, with higher strength of prefrontal FC relating of worse accuracy (d-prime) regardless of task block, and with high modularity correlating with slow response times on the LF task, measured by HbR signal. Higher efficiencies tended to correspond to better accuracy but none of the tests were significant. High-P showed low FC strength and high efficiency relative to others, while Low-P had high modularity and low efficiency, in line with the direction of the brain-behavior correlations. Lastly, we characterized the centrally important regions (hubs). These tended to be located in the left inferior area. High-P's hubs overlapped with those showing consistent hubs behavior at the group level, while Low-P's hubs were uncommon. Conclusions: We identified network properties related to efficient and inefficient language processing in typical participants, which can be used to assess language function of atypical populations in future studies.",

      "title": "Astrocytic FKBP5 Regulates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Outcomes in Excitotoxic Brain Injury",
      "content": "FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) is a multisignaling cochaperone that regulates cellular responses to stress. FKBP51 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes; however, the role of FKBP51 in excitotoxic brain injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated how both global and astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 deletion influence seizure susceptibility, astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and cognition in male mice subjected to a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model. Global Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5-KO) presented lower seizure activity along with decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared with the wild-type mice. Astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 conditional knockout (aFkbp5-cKO) mice similarly attenuated seizure severity, decreased astrogliosis, improved novel object recognition, and preserved glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in hippocampal CA3. Glia-neuron mixed cultures derived from Fkbp5-KO brains showed reduction of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, astrogliosis, accompanied by decreased NF-{kappa}B p65 phosphorylation. Notably, overexpression of an Fkbp5 quadruple mutant that disrupts the FKBP51-NF-{kappa}B interaction inhibited proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced astrogliosis and NF-{kappa}B activation. The hippocampal transcriptome of the LPS-treated Fkbp5-KO mice revealed suppression of NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, this study highlights FKBP51 as a key mediator of excitotoxin-induced neuroinflammation and GLT-1 dysfunction and underlines NF-{kappa}B-mediated inflammatory astrogliosis as a potential intervention target for excitotoxic brain injury.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
