      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

More details about the project can be found in the README at .<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.

Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081 - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.

      "title": "A Dead-Simple Reservation Web App Framework Abusing Mkdocs",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted a reservation system web app for my apartment building's amenities, but the available open source solutions were too complicated, so <a href=\"https://github.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it\">I built my own</a>. Ended up turning it into a lightweight framework, implemented as a mkdocs plugin to abuse mkdocs/material as a frontend build tool. So you get the full aesthetic customization capababilities those provide. I call it... <strong>Reserve-It!</strong></p> <p>It just requires a dedicated Google account for the app, since it uses Google Calendar for persistent calendar stores.</p> <ul> <li>You make a calendar for each independently reservable resource (like say a single tennis court) and bundle multiple interchangeable resources (multiple tennis courts) into one form page interface.</li> <li>Users' confirmation emails are really just Gcal events the app account invites them to. Users can opt to receive event reminders, which are just Gcal event updates in a trenchcoat triggered N minutes before.</li> <li>Users don't need accounts, just an email address. A minimal sqlite database stores addresses that have made reservations, and each one can only hold one reservation at a time. Users can cancel their events and reschedule.</li> <li>You can add additional custom form inputs for a shared password you disseminate on community communication channels, or any additional validation your heart desires. Custom validation just requires subclassing a provided pydantic model.</li> </ul> <p>You define reservable resources in a directory full of yaml files like this:</p> <pre><code># resource page title name: Tennis Courts # displayed along with title emoji: \ud83c\udfbe # resource page subtitle description: Love is nothing. # the google calendar ids for each individual tennis court, and their hex colors for the # embedded calendar view. calendars: CourtA: id: longhexstring1@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#AA0000&quot; CourtB: id: longhexstring2@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#00AA00&quot; CourtC: id: longhexstring3@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#0000AA&quot; day_start_time: 8:00 AM day_end_time: 8:00 PM # the granularity of available reservations, here it's every hour from 8 to 8. minutes_increment: 60 # the maximum allowed reservation length maximum_minutes: 180 # users can choose whether to receive an email reminder minutes_before_reminder: 60 # how far in advance users are allowed to make reservations maximum_days_ahead: 14 # users can indicate whether they're willing to share a resource with others, adds a # checkbox to the form if true allow_shareable: true # Optionally, add additional custom form fields to this resource reservation webpage, on # top of the ones defined in app-config.yaml custom_form_fields: - type: number name: ntrp label: NTRP Rating required: True # Optionally, specify a path to a descriptive image for this resource, displayed on the # form webpage. Must be a path relative to resource-configs dir. image: path: courts.jpg caption: court map pixel_width: 800 </code></pre> <p>Each one maps to a form webpage built for that resource, which looks like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it/refs/heads/main/form-page.png\">this</a>.</p> <p>I'm gonna go ahead and call myself a bootleg full stack developer now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mediocre_Musician889\"> /u/Mediocre_Musician889 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",
