      "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

Just pure vibes. \ud83e\udd16\u2728</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> As a Neovim user, I've wanted a way to jump to pytest fixture definitions for <em>years</em>. You know that feeling when you see \u2060def test_something(my_fixture): and you're like &quot;where the hell is this fixture defined?&quot; But I never found the time to actually build something.</p> <p>So I thought... what if I just try to vibe it? Worst case, I waste an afternoon. Best case, I get my fixture navigation.</p> <p>Turns out it worked <em>way</em> better than I was expecting.</p> <p><strong>What it does:</strong></p> <ul> <li>\ud83c\udfaf <strong>Go to Definition</strong> - Jump directly to fixture definitions from anywhere they're used</li> <li>\ud83d\udd0d <strong>Find References</strong> - Find all usages of a fixture across your entire test suite</li> <li>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Hover Documentation</strong> - View fixture information on hover</li> <li>\u26a1\ufe0f <strong>Blazingly fast</strong> - Built with Rust for maximum performance</li> </ul> <p><strong>The best part?</strong> It properly handles pytest's fixture shadowing rules, automatically discovers fixtures from popular plugins (pytest-django, pytest-asyncio, etc.), and works with your virtual environments out of the box.</p> <p><strong>Installation:</strong></p> <p># PyPI (easiest)</p> <p>uv tool install pytest-language-server</p> <p># Homebrew</p> <p>brew install bellini666/tap/pytest-language-server</p> <p># Cargo</p> <p>cargo install pytest-language-server</p> <p>Works with Neovim, Zed, VS Code, or any editor with LSP support.</p> <p>This whole thing was an experiment in AI-assisted development.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I'm building a VSCode extension that helps with understanding your codebase, particularly at a higher level where you need to figure out complex relationships between multiple files and modules.</p> <p>It helps you quickly get an overview of the area of the codebase you're interested in, and lets you see how files and folders relate to each other based on dependency.</p> <p>Kinda like a dependency graph, but it's the actual code files as the nodes, so you can see the actual code, you can ctrl+click on tokens like functions and variables to see their dependencies throughout the codebase, you can see the diffs for the local changes, and much more.</p> <p>Python support was the most requested feature so far and I just recently added it to the extension.</p> <p>I'm not a python dev, so I'm still learning how the language works, and would love any feedback from actual python devs if this type of visualisation is useful for you or if something else would be better. I'm using it for JS and I think it's really useful to see relationships between imports/exports, function usage and be able to follow props being passed down multiple levels, or a complex non-linear flow between multiple files.</p> <p>You can get it on the vscode marketplace by looking for 'code canvas app'.</p> <p>Or get it from this link <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alex-c.code-canvas-app\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alex-c.code-canvas-app</a></p> <p>It uses VSCode's LSP for creating the edges between tokens so you need to have the python/pylance vscode extension installed as well.</p> <p>For the imports/exports edges and symbol outlines in the files when zooming out it uses ast-grep, which was just added recently and I've had a lot of issues with it, especially getting it to work on windows, but I think it should be fine now. Let me know if you encounter any issues.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard_Ant4378\"> /u/Standard_Ant4378 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxw0gf/added_python_support_for_my_vscode_extension_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxw0gf/added_python_support_for_my_vscode_extension_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",
