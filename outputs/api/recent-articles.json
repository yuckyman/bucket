      "title": "Object-scene semantics correlation analysis for image emotion classification",
      "content": "IntroductionImage emotion classification (IEC), which predicts human emotional perception from images, is a research highlight for its wide applications. Recently, most existing methods have focused on predicting emotions by mining semantic information. However, the \u201caffective gap\u201d between low-level pixels and high-level emotions constrains semantic representation and degrades model performance. It has been demonstrated in psychology that emotions can be triggered by the interaction between meaningful objects and their rich surroundings within an image. Inspired by this, we propose an Object-Scene Attention Fusion Network (OSAFN) that leverages object-level concepts and scene-level reasoning as auxiliary information for enhanced emotional classification.MethodsThe proposed OSAFN designs two different strategies to extract semantic information. Specifically, concepts are selected by utilizing an external concept extraction tool, and an Appraisal-based Chain-of-Thought (Appraisal-CoT) prompting is introduced to guide large language models in generating scene information. Next, two different attention-based modules are developed for aligning semantic features with visual features to enhance visual representations. Then, an adaptive fusion strategy is introduced for integrating the results of both the object-semantic stream and the scene-semantic stream. Additionally, a polarity-aware contrastive loss is proposed to model the hierarchical structure of emotions, improving the discrimination of fine-grained emotional categories.Results and discussionTo evaluate the effectiveness of OSAFN, we conducted numerical experiments on four affective datasets. The results demonstrate that OSAFN achieves superior performance and represents a notable contribution in the field of IEC.",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",
