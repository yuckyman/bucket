      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Evaluating and Classifying Gentleness in VR-Based Surgical Simulation: A VR+fNIRS Study",
      "content": "Gentleness, defined as the ability to handle tissues delicately and minimize unnecessary force, is a key indicator of surgical proficiency. Objective and real-time assessment of gentleness in virtual reality (VR)-based training can enhance the understanding of both psychomotor and cognitive aspects of surgical skill. This study evaluates and classifies participants gentleness during VR-based surgical simulations using fNIRS-derived hemodynamic features. We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97). These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-derived hemodynamic dynamics can reliably discriminate between high and low VR performance levels, supporting their potential use in automated performance assessment and neuroadaptive feedback frameworks for VR-based surgical training.",

      "title": "When exploration replaces storage: how eye movements shape visual working memory",
      "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) is traditionally studied while constraining eye movements and limiting access to visual input, yet in natural vision humans constantly explore and resample their environment. Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use. Our findings challenge fixation-based approaches to VWM research and highlight the importance of studying cognition under ecological viewing conditions.",

      "title": "Gender perception of pareidolia faces in emergency department patients: the influence of physician gender",
      "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

      "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
      "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

The key points they laid out were:</p> <ol> <li>Backend frameworks like FastAPI are really mature and have great developer experience</li> <li>Types are first class, and this makes it easy to write and debug backend code</li> <li>The level of abstraction FastAPI provides is <em>just right</em></li> </ol> <p>However, I came to a different conclusion on how client side code could be improved.</p> <p>I believe that the biggest point of friction when writing client side code that interfaces with backend HTTP APIs is the HTTP boundary between frontend and backend. <strong>All the well written function signatures, types and docstrings on the backend is lost</strong> when writing the frontend code, to be recreated painstakingly through reading through the OpenAPI/Swagger docs.</p> <p>OpenAPI docs are an <strong>out-of-band information source</strong> that the frontend must be kept in sync with and there is no information on when it is updated, what changed and no error checking or type validation supports you as you write the frontend code.</p> <p>I believe that the solution is maintaining the function signature of the backend code on the frontend, including arguments, their types, whether they are optional, etc.</p> <pre><code>from server import get_item from http_clientlib import set_default_configuration, wrap_backend_call from http_clientlib.http import make_http_request set_default_configuration( base_url=&quot;http://production.backend.com&quot;, http_request_function=make_http_request ) # Wrap the backend function and invoke it to make a HTTP request get_item_http = wrap_backend_call(get_item) response = get_item_http(item_id=42, page=2) print(response) # Response is a HTTPResponse you can handle if response.ok(): ... </code></pre> <p>A screenshot showing how the type information looks like is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#why\">https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#why</a></p> <p>This RPC-style approach allows you to treat the function call as a networking call separate from a normal function, handle the response however you like, only with better type information for the backend endpoints in your editor.</p> <p>Some caveats are:</p> <ol> <li>Python-only \u2014 Works for a frontend/backend stack built in python, and quite a bit of client-side code is written for the browser</li> <li>Server code must be imported \u2014 Client needs access to server function definitions</li> </ol> <p>I whipped this up pretty quickly and it's not fully featured yet, but I wanted to stir some discussion on whether something like this would be useful, and if the RPC approach would make sense in python - something similar already exists on the JS world as <a href=\"https://trpc.io/\">tRPC</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/zhuweiji/http_clientlib\">github</a>, <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/http_clientlib/\">pypi (http_clientlib)</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/19andNuttin\"> /u/19andNuttin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3xahl/making_a_better_clientside_experience_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3xahl/making_a_better_clientside_experience_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Everyone,<br /> I am sharing this tool I created called TerminallyQuick v4.0(<a href=\"https://github.com/raghav4882/TerminallyQuick\">https://github.com/raghav4882/TerminallyQuick</a>) here because I was exhausted with tools like JPEGmini, Photoshop scripts / Photoshop in general, Smush &amp; other plugins (even though they are great!) being slow on my servers compared to my PC/Mac.</p> <p>Wordpress Designers like me works with many images, Envato Licenses, Subscriptions and ofcourse,;CLIENT DSLR DUMPS (*cries in wordpress block*)</p> <p>This is a MIT Licensed, Self-contained Python tool that has a .bat (batch fil) for Windows and a .command file for Macs that is 100% isolated in its virtual environment of Python. IT doesn't mess with your homebrew installs. it is descriptive and transparent on every step so you know what is exactly happening. I didn't know how much work that would be before I got into it, But it finally came together :') I wanted to make sure User experience was better when you use it rather than the janky UI that only I understood. It installs Pillow and other relevant dependencies automatically.</p> <p>It takes the smallest edge for the size, so if you put in 450px (default is 800), whatever image you give it, it will take it and check for smallest edge and make it 450px, and adjusts the other edge proportionally. (Basic options to crop too, default is no, ofcourse).</p> <p>I had previously created a thread sharing the same when this project was in infancy (v2.0) about 5 months ago. A lot has changed since and alot more is polished. I cleaned the code and made it multithreaded. I humanly cannot write all the features down below because my ADHD doesn't allow me, so please feel free to just visit the Github page and details are right there. I have added Fastrack Profiles so you can save your selections and just fly through your images. There's something called watchdog that does what it says. A watchdog is something that points to directory you have chosen to paste photos and optimize them when pasted automatically to said config. you stop it and it stops.</p> <p>Multiple image formats and Quality options (upscaling as well) made it fast for me to work with projects. Such that I don't use plugins anymore to compress images on my server as doing on my system is just plain faster and less painful. Personal choice obviously, Your workflow might differ. Anyways.</p> <p>Thanks for your time reading this.<br /> Happy New Year everyone! I hope you all land great clients and projects this year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/raghav4882\"> /u/raghav4882 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3dm9t/github_raghav4882terminallyquick_v40_fast/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3dm9t/github_raghav4882terminallyquick_v40_fast/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",
