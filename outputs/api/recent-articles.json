      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>! I've been working on a focused library called <strong>calgebra</strong> that applies set operations to calendars.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>calgebra lets you compose calendar timelines using set operators: <code>|</code> (union), <code>&amp;</code> (intersection), <code>-</code> (difference), and <code>~</code> (complement). Queries are lazy\u2014you build expressions first, then execute via slicing.</p> <p><strong>Example \u2013 find when a team is free for a 2+ hour meeting:</strong></p> <p>```python from calgebra import day_of_week, time_of_day, hours, HOUR</p> <h1>Define business hours</h1> <p>weekend = day_of_week([&quot;saturday&quot;, &quot;sunday&quot;], tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;) weekdays = ~weekend business_hours = weekdays &amp; time_of_day(start=9<em>HOUR, duration=8</em>HOUR, tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;)</p> <h1>Team calendars (Google Calendar, .ics files, etc.)</h1> <p>team_busy = alice | bob | charlie</p> <h1>One expression to find available slots</h1> <p>free_slots = (business_hours - team_busy) &amp; (hours &gt;= 2) ```</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong> - Set operations on timelines (union, intersection, difference, complement) - Lazy composition \u2013 build complex queries, execute via slicing - Recurring patterns with RFC 5545 support - Filter by duration, metadata, or custom properties - Google Calendar read/write integration - iCalendar (.ics) import/export</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Developers building scheduling features, calendar integrations, or availability analysis. Also well-suited for AI/coding agents as the composable, type-hinted API works nicely as a tool.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Most calendar libraries focus on parsing (icalendar, ics.py) or API access (gcsa, google-api-python-client). calgebra is about <em>composing</em> calendars algebraically:</p> <ul> <li><strong>icalendar / ics.py</strong>: Parse .ics files \u2192 calgebra can <em>import</em> from these, then let you query and combine them</li> <li><strong>gcsa</strong>: Google Calendar CRUD \u2192 calgebra wraps gcsa and adds set operations on top</li> <li><strong>dateutil.rrule</strong>: Generate recurrences \u2192 calgebra uses this internally but exposes timelines you can intersect/subtract</li> </ul> <p>The closest analog is SQL for time ranges, but expressed as Python operators.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra\">https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra</a> - Video of a calgebra enabled agent: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k\">https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k</a></p> <p>Would love feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive-Glass-523\"> /u/Impressive-Glass-523 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
