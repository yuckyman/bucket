      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Biologically Inspired Deep Neural Network Models for Visual Emotion Processing",
      "content": "The perception of opportunities and threats in complex visual scenes represents one of the main functions of the human visual system. The underlying neurophysiology is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise in modeling visual recognition of objects, their capacity to model visual affective processing remains to be better understood. In this study, we proposed a biologically inspired deep neural network model, referred to as the Visual Cortex Amygdala (VCA) model, that integrates a vision transformer with an amygdala-mimetic module designed to reflect both the anatomical hierarchy and self-attention-based computational mechanisms of the human brain. We evaluated the model along three dimensions: (1) predictive accuracy for emotional valence and arousal, (2) representational alignment with human amygdala activity, and (3) neural mechanisms of emotion representation. Our results showed that (1) the model can predict with high accuracy human emotion ratings on 1,182 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset (valence r > 0.9; arousal r > 0.7), (2) the model's internal representations aligned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the human amygdala, and (3) at the single neuron level, the amygdala module evolved emotion selectivity, and at the neuronal population level, the representational geometry became progressively more aligned with psychological models of emotion. Additional issues explored included (1) the effect of visual encoding and (2) the effect of structure and computational mechanisms on emotional assessment.",

      "title": "Next-Generation Neural Mass Models Reproduce Features of Speech Processing",
      "content": "Segregation of speech into syllables is a key step in neural speech processing. It relies on the alignment of neural activity with the rhythmic structure of speech. Two neurological mechanisms have been suggested: phase-resetting of existing neural oscillations, or evoked responses to acoustic features of the speech signal. From EEG experiment, it is known that a distinct feature of this neural entrainment is that its strength is correlated with phonemes sharpness. Here, we reproduce this EEG experiment in-silico. In particular, we use a biophysical neural mass model to simulate the neural response to the same near-isochronus, consonant-vowel stimuli as the EEG study. We compare this to the response of two other, phenomenological, models that are designed to represent the proposed mechanisms: one a phase-resetting oscillator, the other an evoked-response filter. The biophysical neural mass model captures population-level oscillations without being tailored to speech. All three models can reproduce the correlation between phoneme sharpness and entrainment strength. While both the phase-resetting and evoked models succeed in reproducing the experimental result, the phase-resetting model is arguably more parsimonious since it does not require the preprocessing the evoked model needs to convert a sound envelope into features. Interestingly, the neural mass model also succeeded, without being tailored to the stimulus, unlike the other two models. For example, it does not respond at a specific stimulus-targeted frequency and it is robust across different parameter settings. Our results suggest that generic oscillatory dynamics in cortical populations may be sufficient to generate sharpness-dependent entrainment to speech.",

      "title": "Local translation controls early reactive changes in perisynaptic astrocyte processes at pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer s disease",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION Understanding the progression of cellular dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer s disease (AD) is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies. Early alterations in astrocyte perisynaptic functions have been observed in AD, yet the molecular underpinnings remain poorly characterized. Here, we hypothesized that local protein synthesis, a critical mechanism for maintaining astrocyte polarity and subcellular compartmentalization, could be impaired at early AD stages. METHODS We studied the effect of oligomeric Ab on mRNA translation by imaging puromycylated-nascent protein chains in primary astrocytes alone or in coculture with neurons. To further characterize effects on astrocyte translation, we extracted by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), ribosome-bound mRNAs from hippocampal astrocytes and perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAP) in wild type (WT) and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mice at 5.5 months, a pre-symptomatic stage corresponding to the initiation of Ab plaque formation. mRNAs were analyzed by high throughput RNA sequencing and compared between genotypes and astrocyte compartments. Results were further verified by RT qPCR in purified hippocampal synaptogliosomes as well as gliovascular units, and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We addressed the role of the Janus Kinase (JAK) Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, a master regulator of reactive astrocytes, on the early mRNA expression and distribution in astrocytes by astrocyte-specific viral gene transfer of the pathway inhibitor Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) in hippocampal astrocytes in WT and APP mice. RESULTS Ab induced global and local translational perturbations in primary astrocytes. 5.5 months APP PAPs showed prominent translational changes compared to whole APP astrocytes and WT. They were related mainly to axon development, neurotransmitter transport, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Some upregulated mRNAs accumulated in APP PAPs from 3 months, but not in astrocyte perivascular processes (PvAP). From this stage, Serpina3n total mRNAs encoding the serine protease inhibitor A3 accumulated in astrocyte soma and PAPs, and this effect was rescued in PAPs upon JAK STAT3 inhibition. DISCUSSION Our findings show that in APP mice, significant translational changes predominantly occur in PAPs at pre-symptomatic stages of AD. They are sustained, as observed for Serpina3n, by the upregulation and distribution of total mRNAs specifically in PAPs from 3 months. The JAK-STAT3 pathway contribute to the distribution of Serpina3n mRNAs in APP PAPs as early as 3 months. These early local events could be related to soluble Ab as well as early synaptic dysregulations sensed by PAPs, which may trigger local astrocyte reactivity. Thus, targeting local translation in astrocytes may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract early synaptic alterations in AD.",

      "title": "Evaluating exon-skipping therapies targeting the central nervous system in Duchenne muscular dystrophy using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics",
      "content": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is marked by progressive muscle degeneration due to dystrophin deficiency. Despite cognitive impairments in up to one-third of patients, central nervous system (CNS)-targeted dystrophin restoration remains relatively underexplored compared to muscle-focused therapies. Since dystrophin is expressed in the brain during development and postnatally, it is important to assess which aspects of CNS pathology could be rescued. However, studying Dmd is difficult due to its size, low-abundance transcripts, and with multiple isoforms, limiting the sensitivity and isoform resolution of standard sequencing methods. To overcome these limitations, we applied Xenium spatial transcriptomics to target splice junctions, enabling isoform-specific and exon 51 skipping events detection across brain regions and cell types. Using this approach, we analyzed mdx52 mice lacking the full-length and Dp140 isoforms, treated with two exon 51 skipping therapies (antisense oligonucleotides or AAV-U7ex51). We observed distinct spatial expression patterns in the wild type brain between the full-length isoforms (Dp427c/m/p1) and shorter isoforms (Dp71 and Dp40). The full-length isoforms were predominantly expressed in cortex layers 2/3-6b and the CA1 region, while the shorter isoforms were localized to cortex layer 1 and the dentate gyrus. Among the exon skipping therapies tested, U7ex51 delivered neonatally induced broad exon skipping in neurons and effectively restored full-length isoforms in the targeted cells. This study introduces the first subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of dystrophin presence and rescue in the CNS and demonstrates a framework for evaluating gene therapies in spatially and transcriptionally complex tissues such as the brain.",
