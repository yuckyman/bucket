      "title": "Density-based longitudinal neuron tracking in high-density electrophysiological recordings",
      "content": "Tracking single neurons across days in high-density extracellular recordings is essential for establishing neural mechanisms of learning, memory, and post-injury recovery. However, in weeks-long recordings, identifying cross-day matches among thousands of units is confounded by changes in spike waveforms, unit turnover, and representational drift in neural responses. We introduce DANT (Density-based Across-day Neuron Tracking), an unsupervised framework that jointly estimates probe motion and neuron identity by alternating between density-based clustering in feature space and probe-motion correction inferred from provisional matches. Estimated drift is used to re-register spike waveforms across sessions, after which clustering is recomputed; this iterative loop continues until the set of matches stabilizes. In parallel, DANT learns a decision boundary from match and non-match assignments derived from the clustering results, enabling it to reject low-similarity candidate pairs. Applied to weeks-long Neuropixels recordings from the cortex and striatum in freely moving rats during stable behavior and task switching, DANT substantially increases match yield and reduces false negatives while maintaining a low false-positive rate relative to existing approaches. Together, these results indicate that DANT provides a general, unsupervised solution for longitudinal tracking in chronic, high-density recordings.",

      "title": "Context-dependent low-dimensional neural dynamics unfold in distinct subspaces, dimensionality, and dynamical strength for natural walking and reaching",
      "content": "Awake behaving animal experiments paired with multichannel electrode recordings have advanced motor systems neuroscience in creating models of how the mammalian brain controls movements. However, growing theoretical and experimental evidence question the generalizability of such findings from constrained studies to ambulatory behavior, highlighting a limitation in our understanding of how the brain controls movement. To address this question, spiking neural activity during highly-practiced, routine movement (walking) and goal-directed behavior (reaching towards food) were compared in an unconstrained setting. Kinematic trajectories of the contralateral arm during reaching and walking were statistically similar, as were the average single-neuron firing rates during these respective movements. However, the dimensionality of reaching was higher than that of walking and existed in largely non-overlapping subspaces. Further, when modeled as dynamical systems, reaching decayed 3-5 times more quickly than walking. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the low-dimensional structure of motor cortex is more complex for goal-directed reaching than in highly-practiced natural movements. Since this difference is primarily observable at the state and dynamical systems level, these findings suggest behavioral context plays a significant role in the coordination of otherwise kinematically similar movements, providing indirect evidence for non-cortical circuits such as central pattern generators.",

      "title": "Cografting strategies uncover cell type dependent regulation of dopamine neuron specification and functional maturation in a pre clinical model of Parkinson`s Disease",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum and subsequent motor symptoms. Transplantation of ventral midbrain-patterned DA (vmDA) progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells, aimed at restoring DA neurotransmission in the striatum, is being developed and currently explored in ongoing clinical trials. One factor that may improve the maturation and fate determination of DA neurons in vivo is the intercellular communication within the graft environment, ultimately affecting the therapeutic outcome. In this study, we co-transplanted vmDA progenitors with either glial, ventral forebrain or striatal progenitors into a preclinical xenograft PD model to investigate how these interactions shape the development, maturation, and function of therapeutic DA neurons. Our findings show that co-grafts with ventral forebrain progenitors increase the yield of DA neurons and also promote their functional maturation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that co-grafts with striatal neurons promote functional maturation and the acquisition of DA subtype identity. From these data, we identified EBF3 and PBX3 as candidate transcription factors directing DA neuron maturation and subtype specification, and then functionally validated their role in brain organoids. Taken together, our data highlight that the cellular microenvironment, including specific interactions with neighbouring cells, guides in vivo DA neuron specification and maturation. These findings provide a foundation for developing more refined and effective cell preparations for replacement therapy in PD, and define a conceptual framework that could inform stem cell based strategies for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

      "title": "Conditioned place preferences for virtual reality cannabis cues.",
      "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

      "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.
