      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Coordinated multilaminar dynamics underlie multiplexed computation in motor cortex",
      "content": "Functional multiplexing is a signature of higher-order brain regions. Beyond single-unit mixed selectivity, the six-layered cortical microcircuit has been proposed as an optimal substrate for such parallel computations. Recurrent connections within and across layers allow cortical columns to retain incoming information for some time and integrate it into stable latent representations, thereby acting as functional units. The key question is whether the multiplexing capacity arises from specialized processing within individual layers or the collective coordination of multi-layer activity patterns. Here, we analyzed laminar recordings from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-sample task. We identified laminarly distributed, behaviorally specific subspaces that captured the encoding of distinct task-related variables. These subspaces, spanning the entire column and expressed as coordinated activity patterns, were functionally reused to encode the same variable over time and flexibly recycled to encode new ones. Subtle variations of laminar weights gave rise to multiple coexistent laminar coding subspaces, enabling multiplexing at the columnar level. Task-related information propagated across layers in temporally organized trajectories that transiently localized in superficial or deep layers at distinct trial epochs. These organized laminar trajectories were consistently observed across recording sites, but exhibited site-specific propagation patterns. The activity of the population on the other hand lacked structured dynamics. Thus, laminar trajectories of information emerged atop a background of spatially and temporally unspecific activity-fluctuations.",

      "content": "The use of multiple languages modulates the neural mechanisms of selective attention, but it is unclear whether these adaptations require continuous engagement and active second language usage. Here we examined whether language usage shapes selective attention in bilingualism, and what neural processes might this engage. 48 highly proficient English-French bilinguals listened to naturalistic speech streams in their first or second language, paired with either linguistic and non-linguistic interference. Participants were matched on their L2 proficiency, but were either Active, Moderate, or Inactive users of their second language. The results revealed usage-related modulation of oscillatory activity in the alpha band, with more efficient inhibitory control in Active and Moderate users leading to behavioural resilience to interference. In contrast, usage did not affect lower-level perceptual tracking of speech, as captured by mTRF decoding of speech envelopes across frequency bands. Taken together, our findings show that resilience to interference during language processing is not dependent on the perceptual speech tracking, but rather on the capacity to recruit higher-level attentional control mechanisms, a process that is dynamically shaped by bilinguals L2 usage.",

      "title": "A cholinergic mechanism orchestrating task-dependent computation across the cortex",
      "content": "In an ever-changing environment, animals often need to switch between performing different tasks involving distinct sets of cognitive processes. Many such tasks involve neural activity distributed across the cortex, with dynamics that depend on both task demands and behavioral strategy. A fundamental but unanswered question is what circuit mechanisms orchestrate these task-dependent dynamics. Here, we hypothesized that acetylcholine release in the cortex plays a key role. The cortex's only long-range source of this neuromodulator is the basal forebrain cholinergic system, which targets the entire cortical sheet and can individually modulate single regions on sub-second timescales. To test our hypothesis, we first imaged cholinergic axons innervating the cortex while mice switched frequently between two navigational decision-making tasks in virtual reality (VR), only one of which required gradual accumulation of sensory evidence. We found that cholinergic input to the cortex is spatiotemporally heterogeneous and multiplexes sensory, motor, arousal, and cognitive signals in a task- and strategy-dependent fashion, with overall higher activity during evidence accumulation. Crucially, beyond contextual variables, cholinergic activity directly tracked task computations themselves, encoding an evidence-dependent decision variable only in the accumulation task. To test if acetylcholine release is causal to the performance of each task, we optogenetically silenced cholinergic terminals in the cortex while simultaneously imaging excitatory cortical activity. We found that this input is selectively required for evidence accumulation, and for large-scale cortical coding of evidence and choice during the accumulation task. Thus, we have identified a new cholinergic mechanism that orchestrates cortex-wide activity in a task-dependent manner and serves as a key node in the distributed brain network underlying the accumulation of sensory evidence.",

      "title": "Decoding the neural stages from action and object recognition to mentalizing",
      "content": "Higher-level action interpretation, such as inferring underlying intentions and predicting future actions, requires the integration of conceptual action information (e.g. \"opening\") with semantic knowledge about persons and objects (e.g. \"my friend Anna\", \"pizza box\"). However, how the neural systems for action and object recognition and memory interact with each other to form the basis for inferring higher-level mental states remains unclear. Here we use fMRI-based crossmodal multiple regression representational similarity analysis in human female and male participants to elucidate the processing stages from basic action and object recognition to mentalizing. We show that inferring intentions from observed actions or written sentences involves a modality-general network of lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal brain regions associated with conceptual action and object representation and mentalizing. The representational profiles in these regions are explained by models capturing different types of conceptual information, revealing distinct but partially overlapping networks for action, object, and mental state representation. There was no strict separation of networks for action, object, and mental state representations, arguing against a sequential bottom-up hierarchy from action and object understanding pathways to the mentalizing network. Rather, left-hemispheric regions, specifically ventrolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior lateral occipitotemporal cortex, showed strong representational overlap, pointing towards a core network for making meaning of action-object structures at a conceptual level. We argue that this core network represents a distributional semantic hub between classic networks for action and object understanding and the mentalizing network.",

      "title": "Inferential planning in the frontal cortex",
      "content": "How the brain plans and maintains sequences of future actions remains a central question in systems neuroscience. Recent studies in the frontal cortex have revealed that multiple elements of a sequence are represented simultaneously in separable neural subspaces, challenging classical serial models of sequential planning. Here, we show that these representations emerge naturally under inferential planning in which sequential actions are inferred from sensory evidence and goals. Using a hierarchical generative model, we reproduce key neural phenomena observed in primate frontal cortex, including the simultaneous activation of multiple plan elements, the emergence of (almost) orthogonal `memory' subspaces, and their reuse across forward and backward sequence tasks. Our approach provides a mechanistic account of how probabilistic inference over control states gives rise to distributed and dynamic neural representations of plans. This framework not only unifies previously disparate findings on planning, working memory, and motor preparation, but also generates novel, testable predictions about the dynamics of active inference, the role of sensory subspaces, and the impact of uncertainty on sequence processing.",

      "title": "Dynamic brain states during encoding and their post-encoding reinstatement predicts episodic memory in children",
      "content": "Episodic memory, the ability to rapidly learn and explicitly remember past events and experiences, plays a critical role in childrens academic learning and knowledge acquisition. The formation of lasting memories relies on the brain's ability to dynamically organize its activity. How these neural configurations unfold moment-by-moment across encoding and offline phases remains poorly understood. To probe these dynamics, we applied a novel Bayesian Switching Dynamic Systems approach, a hidden Markov model with automatic state detection, to fMRI data from children performing scene encoding followed by an offline post-encoding rest. We identified four distinct brain states during encoding with unique activation modes between visual, medial temporal lobe, and frontoparietal and default mode network nodes. An \"active-encoding\" state with integrated visual-hippocampal and frontoparietal activity dominated encoding and predicted individual memory performance, while an inactive state negatively predicted performance. State transition dynamics revealed that flexible shifts into the active-encoding state enhanced memory formation, whereas transitions toward inactive states impaired it, demonstrating that memory success depends on dynamic neural flexibility. Critically, encoding states spontaneously reemerged during post-encoding rest. A \"default-mode\" state characterized by enhanced default mode network activity showed sustained maintenance during rest and robustly predicted memory outcomes, an effect specific to post-encoding, not pre-encoding rest. These findings establish that episodic memory emerges from coordinated brain state sequences bridging online encoding with offline consolidation, providing a computational framework for how moment-to-moment neural dynamics support memory formation in children. This work has broad implications for optimizing educational interventions and understanding developmental disorders affecting learning and memory.",

      "title": "Ventral Hippocampal Temporoammonic and Schaffer Collateral Pathways Differentially Control Fear- and Anxiety-Related Behaviors",
      "content": "The ventral hippocampus plays a crucial role in regulating anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Previously, we demonstrated that diazepam reduces anxiety-like behavior by inhibiting the dentate gyrus and CA3 principal neurons via 2-GABAARs, while inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is necessary to suppress fear-related responses. This study investigated the role of inputs from ventral CA3 (vCA3) and entorhinal cortex to ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anxiety- and fear-like behavior using bidirectional optogenetic modulations. Adult C57BL/6J male and female mice were subjected to bilateral stereotaxic injection of a viral vector expressing channelrhodopsin or halorhodopsin into vCA3 or into layers II-III of lateral entorhinal cortex, followed by bilateral implantation of fiberoptic ferrules into vCA1. After four weeks of recovery, mice were assessed for anxiety-like behavior in the novel open field, elevated plus maze, and Vogel conflict tests, and by contextual and trace fear conditioning for fear. The behavior of the mice was recorded under laser  ON and  OFF conditions in all experiments. The activation of vCA3 to vCA1 projections (i.e., Schaffer collateral pathway) increased anxiety- and fear-related behaviors, whereas inhibition reduced such behaviors. In contrast, optogenetic activation or inhibition of EC to vCA1 projections (i.e., temporoammonic pathway) had no effect on anxiety-related behavior but positively or negatively modulated fear-related behavior, respectively. These results suggest that while fear-related behavior is modulated by both inputs to vCA1, modulation of anxiety-related behavior is input-specific for the vCA3 to vCA1 projection. In summary, this study offers mechanistic insights into the complex organization of hippocampal circuitry underlying fear and anxiety.",

      "content": "Humans can rapidly extract abstract, common knowledge from distinct experiences, enabling generalization of this knowledge across tasks within working memory (WM) to guide behavior. Although task-specific representations of WM have been observed in a distributed network encompassing sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices, whether these regions construct task-generalizable representations and whether such representations can be dynamically shaped by task demands remain unclear. Across two functional MRI experiments, we investigated WM generalization across distinct WM tasks (location and object tasks) based on shared underlying task structures. Trial-specific task demands varied between passive maintenance and active, rule-guided manipulation of mnemonic stimuli. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) demonstrated task-generalizable stimulus representations during both maintenance and manipulation. In contrast, the lateral (LFC) and medial (MFC) frontal cortices supported manipulation- and maintenance-based generalization, respectively. Critically, manipulation-based generalization in the PPC and LFC emerged even when participants did not explicitly learn the mapping between task spaces, indicating that active exploration of task structure can spontaneously facilitate generalization across tasks. Together, these findings reveal that flexible generalization for goal-directed behavior is achieved via a distributed WM network, with distinct regions serving active versus passive task demands.",

      "title": "Early Arousal Signals Drive Reward Learning and Subsequent Choice Behaviour",
      "content": "Learning to reinforce rewarding actions and avoid repeated mistakes is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Yet, it remains unclear how distinct neural signals coordinate to implement reward-based decision-making and behavioural adjustment. We obtained simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry during a probabilistic reversal learning task. Leveraging single-trial EEG, we first replicate the presence of two feedback-locked neural representations; an early signal previously linked to alertness and switching behaviours following negative feedback and a late signal associated with value updating and reward learning. Using single-trial pupillometry, we then show that differences in feedback-evoked pupil responses between positive and negative feedback are driven primarily by negative feedback encoding. Jointly examining these EEG and pupillometry signatures, we show that following negative feedback, increased trial-by-trial coupling between the pupil response and the early, but not the late, EEG signal is linked to increased uncertainty and exploration tendency as well as reduced accuracy and evidence accumulation on the next trial. Consistent with previous research implicating the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline system in uncertainty signalling and network resets, we propose that when internal estimates of contextual uncertainty are high following negative feedback, an early signal, likely regulated by locus coeruleus activity, implements a network reset in reward learning structures of a later learning signal. This interruption may simultaneously increase the neural gain related to the processing of novel information and decrease the influence of existing representations in reward learning structures, in turn improving performance by creating new, more accurate internal representations of the external world.",

      "content": "Although it is commonly assumed that early blind individuals have enhanced pitch perception, the literature to date has been contradictory. We measured performance in two tasks known to recruit early vs. late stages of auditory frequency tuning in early blind and sighted individuals with matched levels of musical training. The two groups showed equivalent performance on a tone detection in a notched-noise task that assesses peripheral and subcortical frequency selectivity. In contrast, early blind individuals showed enhanced performance in a pitch discrimination task thought to be mediated by cortical mechanisms. Computational modeling revealed that this enhancement was best explained by reduced internal noise rather than narrower frequency tuning, with both blindness and musical training predicting a reduction in internal noise. These findings identify internal noise as a key factor in experience-driven auditory plasticity as a result of both musical experience and early blindness.",
