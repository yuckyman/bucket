      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "ZC4H2 loss of function is associated with temporal dysregulation of neural stem proliferation and neuron development",
      "content": "ZC4H2 is an X-linked zinc finger transcription factor essential for early neurodevelopment. Pathogenic variants in ZC4H2 are associated with both central and peripheral nervous system pathologies. The molecular and cellular mechanisms driving these phenotypes remain poorly understood, particularly in human female models that have undergone X chromosome inactivation. Neuronal models were differentiated from a human female cell line with a de novo Xq11.2 deletion causing ZC4H2 loss of function, associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cognitive impairment. Using iPSC-derived neural stem cells and cortical organoids, we identified premature neuronal differentiation, reduced BMP-SMAD signaling, and decreased SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. In cortical organoids, ZC4H2 deficiency altered neurogenesis timing, retaining proliferative progenitors while prematurely activating neuronal programs, leading to enlarged organoids with persistent dysregulation of gene programs required for complete neuronal maturation. We identified ZC4H2 target genes likely to mediate these phenotypes and tested a codon-optimized transgene showing both the restoration of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, BMPR2 gene expression, and improved neuronal complexity. These results demonstrate effective ZC4H2 restoration in complex human models and highlight therapeutic potential for ZC4H2-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",
