      "title": "PDZD8 deficiency drives lipid accumulation in SNr and dopaminergic disinhibition",
      "content": "The basal ganglia integrate cortical inputs to regulate motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors through precisely balanced inhibitory and excitatory circuits. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) serves as a major output nucleus exerting tonic inhibition over thalamic and midbrain targets. However, how lipid metabolic disturbances affect SNr circuitry and dopaminergic regulation remains unclear. Here, we identify a crucial role for the lipid transport protein PDZD8 in maintaining basal ganglia circuit integrity. PDZD8 deficiency leads to marked lipid and lipofuscin accumulation selectively in the SNr, accompanied by enhanced striatal inhibitory inputs and reduced SNr projections to the ventromedial thalamus (VM) and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (SNc, VTA). This circuit reorganization results in functional disinhibition and hyperactivation of dopaminergic neurons, producing maladaptive reinforcement of striatal inhibition. Our previous findings revealed that PDZD8 deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired fear memory, behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings demonstrate that lipid accumulation in the SNr disrupts inhibitory output and dopaminergic regulation, forming a maladaptive basal ganglia thalamocortical loop. Our study provides the first mechanistic link between lipid metabolic dysfunction, dopaminergic disinhibition, and ADHD like behavioral phenotypes, highlighting PDZD8 as a key regulator of metabolic circuit coupling in the basal ganglia.",

      "title": "Comparative gene editing reduces dopamine receptor levels across rodent species",
      "content": "Translational challenges in neuroscience originate from species-specific differences that limit the generalizability of experimental findings. Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species. Thereby, it supports comparative neuroscience by facilitating the identification of conserved versus species-specific neural mechanisms with enhanced translational potential.",

      "title": "Cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk: Cardiac rhythms reveal maladaptive cerebral autoregulation and constrained ventilatory status",
      "content": "In the context of brain-heart interactions, several pathways have been proposed to mediate feedback loops between neurophysiological oscillations. However, the role of cerebrovascular dynamics in shaping this interplay remains poorly understood. In particular, the interaction between cardiac autonomic control, ventilation mechanisms, and cerebral autoregulation is not well characterized, especially in ageing and post-stroke conditions, where cerebral perfusion is often compromised. In a cohort of 57 elderly participants, including 30 stroke survivors, we investigated the relationship between cardiac sympathetic activity and both, cerebral blood flow regulation and ventilatory status. Sympathetic reflexes, assessed via cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) during sit-to-stand transitions, were preserved across all participants, with no significant group differences between stroke and non-stroke populations. However, among individuals with constrained ventilation, indexed by reduced end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) at baseline, we identified a more elevated CSI following postural change, scaling with the degree of CO2 dysregulation. Furthermore, transcranial Doppler measurements revealed exaggerated changes in mean flow velocity (MFV) within the right middle cerebral artery in most participants. These MFV shifts significantly correlated with the magnitude of cardiac sympathetic change under orthostatic stress, suggesting that CSI can capture maladaptive neurovascular responses. Together, these findings highlight a distinct cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk in elderly individuals, revealing a potential mechanism of compensatory overactivation under impaired cerebrovascular control.",

      "title": "Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 4 Receptive Field Properties in a Balanced Recurrent Spiking Neuronal Network",
      "content": "Understanding how the cortex encodes sensory input in a biologically efficient and computationally robust manner remains a central question in neuroscience. Predictive coding offers a compelling theoretical framework for such cortical processing, but existing models lack the biological detail to fully explain the function of the cortical microcircuits. This study introduces a spiking neural network model of layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1), grounded in predictive coding principles, to clarify how the thalamorecipient layer transforms feedforward input into prediction-error-like signals under realistic excitatory-inhibitory constraints and to yield testable circuit-level predictions. The model integrates structured feedforward input, distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and balanced lateral connectivity to simulate spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity. Network responses are systematically examined under spatially unstructured noise input and structured grating stimuli. Neural membrane potentials encode real-time reconstruction errors between external input and internal estimates, with spikes dynamically correcting these mismatches. The network reproduces hallmark in vivo features, including irregular spontaneous activity, sparse and selective responses, and emergent orientation and phase tuning. Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) balance was maintained across conditions, with inhibitory neurons exhibiting tighter input coupling than excitatory neurons. Furthermore, the network exhibited contrast-dependent modulation of firing rates and E-I balance, dynamically adjusting its activity to changes in input strength. Decoding analyses demonstrates that structured inputs can be robustly reconstructed under moderate noise levels, although decoding fidelity declines sharply under severe corruption. Together, these results suggest that cortical layer 4 may serve as a structured sensory encoding stage in a hierarchical predictive coding system, providing a biologically grounded foundation for modeling prediction error computations in higher cortical areas.",

      "title": "Neuroprotective action of agonists and modulators of A 1 adenosine receptors upon hyperexcitation: mechanism of the antiepileptic activity and role of neuron-glial interaction",
      "content": "Hyperexcitation of neuronal networks is believed to be the main reason for the excitotoxic death of neurons in different central nervous system pathologies, including epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. G i-coupled receptors can be considered as promising targets for the development of new neuroprotectors. Here, we studied the anticonvulsant activity of the agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of A 1 adenosine receptors (A 1 Rs). Our experiments demonstrate that A 1 R agonists, CCPA and N 6-cyclohexyladenosine (N 6-CHA), suppress hyperexcitation in three different in vitro models , including acute glutamate excitotoxicity, NH 4 Cl-and bicuculline-induced epileptiform activity. We have found that the inhibitory action of the agonists is mediated by the activation of not only the neuronal A 1 Rs but also the astrocytic receptors. In astrocytes, A 1 R agonists enhance GABA release, possibly via induction of calcium transients. Using inhibitory analysis, we have demonstrated that G{beta}{gamma}-mediated activation of phospholipase C and subsequent Ca 2+ mobilization from internal stores are essential for generating calcium transients in astrocytes following N 6-CHA application. We have shown first that Ca 2+-dependent activation of protein kinase C, which is involved in the mechanism of GABA release by astrocytes, is a pivotal step in the realization of the antiepileptic action of A 1 R agonists. Moreover, using the model of epileptiform activity induced by GABA A R blockade, we have shown that PAMs, PD81723 and VCP171, also suppress hyperexcitation. Furthermore, using the picrotoxin-induced epilepsy model in mice, we demonstrated that A 1 R agonists exhibit significant anticonvulsant effects and improve animal survival. The PAMs PD81723 and VCP171, when administered one hour before seizure induction, did not significantly affect seizure severity or survival rates. However, chronic administration of VCP171 produced a pronounced anticonvulsant effect and significantly increased survival.. Importantly, PAMs provided therapeutic benefits without significantly affecting overall activity levels in mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that both agonists and PAMs of A 1 R can be considered as potential therapeutic agents with antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity.",

      "title": "Imagined movement increases the segregation of brain-heart networks",
      "content": "Understanding the mechanisms of motor imagery, the mental simulation of movement without execution, is key for the development of neurotechnologies. For instance, for detecting covert motor intent in noncommunicative patients or refining motor commands through brain-computer interfaces. While motor imagery engages motor-related brain regions, its precise mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in relation to cardiac dynamics. Evidence suggests heart-rate variability features have potential to enhance tasks classifications, yet the brain-heart relationship is not well understood. In this study, we examined motor imagery learning using a task involving right-hand grasping imagery. We found that motor imagery is correlated with a cardiac sympathetic uncoupling with directed connectivity within the motor cortex. Additionally, cerebellar-supplementary motor area segregation, in relation to cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed longitudinal motor learning. These results suggest that varying patterns of heart rhythmicity and brain connectivity within the motor network actively change during motor imagery, suggesting the brain-heart axis as influencer of sensorimotor function and associated neuroplasticity of learning.",

      "title": "Asymmetries in hue measured behaviorally and with visual evoked potentials",
      "content": "Hue percepts vary more rapidly along some directions in color space (e.g. near yellow) than others (e.g. near green) with corresponding differences in the size or stimulus range of different hue categories. The basis for these differences is not known. We examined whether the asymmetries are present in early cortical color coding by comparing the strength of hue differences using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from occipital cortex. Stimuli were spatial gratings with a fixed nominal contrast in the cone-opponent plane that varied sinusoidally in hue rather than saturation. The responses to different levels of hue separation were measured by the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signals and also in behavioral measurements employing a contrast matching task. For both, the same separation in hue angle resulted in stronger responses for angular differences centered on the yellow quadrant of the cone-opponent space. Responses were also larger for the yellow than blue quadrant, ruling out a general sensitivity loss to the blue-yellow axis as the basis for the differences. The responses differences paralleled the asymmetries in the rates of change in color appearance based on analyses of previous measures of hue scaling functions. The presence of these asymmetries in the VEP responses suggests that they arise relatively early in the cortical sensory representation of color rather than emerging late as a product of inference or color category learning.",

      "title": "Memory recall errors reflect interacting sensory and mnemonic representations",
      "content": "Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance of information that is no longer present in the environment. Some accounts propose that WM is supported by abstract representations so that new sensory inputs do not interfere with existing memories. Others posit that early sensory representations are recruited to maintain memory precision, potentially at the cost of interference caused by new inputs. Here we tested these accounts using an orientation recall task to determine whether memory errors reflect interacting representations of sensory and mnemonic information. We found that adding noise to the memoranda and presenting feature-neutral distractors independently increased recall errors. However, distractors that shared a feature with remembered stimuli led to systematic attractive biases such that memory errors were pulled toward the orientation of the distractor. The magnitude of this bias was modulated by both stimulus noise and whether the distractor was behaviorally relevant. Our results demonstrate that while working memory can utilize abstract representations, it remains susceptible to feature-specific sensory interference, suggesting partial reliance on sensory-like codes.",

      "title": "Nuclear receptor-neurotransmitter coupling links behavior to metabolic state",
      "content": "Animals must flexibly respond to environmental stimuli to survive, and optimal responses critically depend on the organism's current needs. Many organisms have evolved both cell-intrinsic and intertissue signaling pathways that integrate metabolic status. However, how this information is encoded in molecular signals is currently not well understood. Here we show that the nematode C. elegans employs lipidated neurohormones that combine the neurotransmitter octopamine and fat metabolism-derived building blocks to relay information about lipid metabolic status and drive inhibition of aversive olfactory responses during food removal. Using targeted metabolomics, we show that lipidated neurohormone synthesis requires the carboxylesterase CEST-2.1, which links octopamine-glucosides with endogenous methyl-branched or diet-derived cyclopropane fatty acids that act as agonists of the nuclear receptor and master regulator of fat metabolism, NHR-49/PPAR. Loss of cest-2.1, loss of bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid production, or loss of endogenous biosynthesis of the methyl-branched fatty acid substrates of CEST-2.1 mimics the behavioral responses of animals lacking octopamine, indicating that regulation of neurotransmitter-dependent behavior is linked to the coordination of fat metabolism via NHR-49/PPAR. Biosynthesis and subsequent neuromodulation via lipidated neurohormone relies on an intertissue trafficking pathway in which octopamine is shuttled first into the intestine where it is chemically modified, which is likely followed by neuronal import and intracellular hydrolysis to finally release free octopamine. We propose that esterase-dependent synthesis and subsequent hydrolysis of lipidated neurohormones represents a chemical encoding mechanism by which animals integrate information from neurotransmitter signaling and lipid homeostasis to direct appropriate behaviors.",

      "title": "Voluntary Dissociation of Motor Unit Activity in the Vastii Muscles",
      "content": "The CNS coordinates movement through consistent activation patterns across muscles and motor units, suggesting the presence of a relatively fixed and high-dimensional number of neural constraints on voluntary actions. In the human quadriceps, the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) control the knee extensor torque and are considered a synergistic pair largely activated by shared neural inputs. However, some evidence suggests that these muscles, or even subregions within them, can be controlled independently. In this study, we investigated whether humans can dissociate neural input to VM and VL during isometric contractions. Ten participants received real-time feedback from multiple intramuscular EMG electrodes that targeted different regions of the VM and VL while attempting to activate each muscle or sub-regions selectively. We found that nine out of ten subjects were able to clearly separate VM and VL activity based on the intramuscular EMG feedback. However, motor unit decomposition from the intramuscular EMGs revealed that selective recruitment of a unique set of motor units was possible only within the proximal region of VM. In contrast, VL and distal VM showed highly correlated activation, indicating tight functional coupling. Correlation analyses confirmed that the proximal VM exhibited distinct activation profiles compared with both distal VM and VL, supporting the existence of compartmentalized control within VM. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to dissociate the activation of motor units within this synergistic muscle group during low-force isometric contractions.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease risk factors are expressed at brain barriers.",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but whether its etiology is cell autonomous remains unclear. Increasing evidence implicates the blood-central nervous system (CNS) barriers in disease development, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic risk factors linked to cells forming the cerebrovasculature to advance this emerging area of research. The objective of this study is to identify PD genetic risk factors associated with blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers, and to validate protein localization in human tissue and experimental models. To do so, we integrated genome-wide association studies and single nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets from the human postmortem substantia nigra (SN), midbrain, or cortical samples from control and PD donors. An in-depth bioinformatics analysis identified genes enriched in cell types that form the multicellular architecture of brain barriers, including CAVIN2, ANXA1, ANO2, and LRP1B. We further validated whether corresponding proteins were present in cell types associated with the blood-CNS barriers in human and mouse post-mortem tissues, as well as in iPSC-differentiated cells and choroid plexus organoids. Results showed that quantifying the proportion of endothelial cells expressing PD-related genes was under-evaluated at the transcript level compared to immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we observed that CAVIN2 and ANXA1 proteins were more abundant at the vasculature of the substantia nigra vs. cortex, and CAVIN2 protein levels were reduced in PD vs. control human postmortem tissues. In contrast, the investigation of mouse postmortem samples demonstrated that the CAVIN2 protein is only present in a subset of mouse blood vessels, compared to nearly all vessels in human tissue. Similarly, mouse ANXA1 protein localizes to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and not at the vasculature, as seen in human tissue. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of PD-relevant risk genes specifically expressed at brain barriers and enriched in PD-relevant brain regions. The secondary outcome is the demonstration of poor transcript-protein correlation in - at least - a subset of PD risk factors, and a low interspecies conservation of protein localization for the selected candidates. In conclusion, the BBB and BCSFB may represent understudied contributors to PD, endothelial-specific proteins appear differentially regulated compared to transcripts, and experimental models require comprehensive validation to ensure relevance to the human condition.",
