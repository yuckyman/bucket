      "title": "From Skin to Cortex: End-to-End Spiking Neural Network Simulation of Tactile Information Flow",
      "content": "Autonomous systems and neuroprosthetic devices demand real-time tactile processing under strict energy and latency constraints. Designing these systems using neuromorphic principles, where communication is event-based and node activity is sparse, could improve their speed and energy efficiency. Here we present an end-to-end spiking neural network model of the ascending tactile pathway, from mechanoreceptors in the skin in humans (or whisker follicles in rodents) to cortical neurons, that operates in an event-driven neuromorphic fashion. The model comprises distinct anatomical stages: three types of mechanoreceptor afferents, the trigeminal ganglion, the brainstem, the thalamic nucleus, and three cortical layers, connected in a feed-forward hierarchy. We demonstrate the model responses to both rodent whisker deflection and human fingertip skin displacement, using information-theoretic analysis, pairwise correlation, and stimulus decoding at each layer. Our results show that tactile information is efficiently encoded and transformed at each stage: stimulus features are represented with high fidelity and reduced redundancy as signals ascend. Notably, simple linear or Bayesian decoders can reliably classify stimulus features from single-neuron activity in the thalamus and cortex for low-noise inputs, highlighting the emergence of robust neural representations. This open-source model is the first to include the mechanosensory periphery in a full tactile pathway simulation, enabling researchers to study how perturbations at any stage affect tactile encoding. Moreover, the network is well-suited for deployment on low-power, real-time neuromorphic hardware, facilitating the development of multi-layer signal processing and tactile navigation algorithms.",

      "title": "Microbiome-behavior coupling shapes infant adaptation to early maternal unpredictability",
      "content": "We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants' behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction (n=256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants' simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data (n=93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis genes. In contrast, maternal unpredictability showed depletions of GABA and tryptophan synthesis in the unique-effects model and, when VOB and the maternal unpredictability by VOB term were included, enrichment of acetate synthesis and quinolinic acid degradation. Notably, the maternal unpredictability by VOB interactions for tryptophan and glutamate were negative, indicating that the VOB-pathway coupling attenuates as unpredictability increases. Together, these findings support a framework in which maternal unpredictability is the environmental challenge, infant VOB expresses the behavioral strategy, and microbial metabolism modulates whether that strategy is biochemically feasible.",

      "title": "A multivariate pattern metric of individualized hemispheric functional asymmetry",
      "content": "Functional asymmetry is a fundamental feature of human brain organization, yet existing measures of functional connectivity asymmetry rely mainly on univariate indices that miss distributed pattern structure. We introduce the Pattern Dissimilarity of Hemispheric Functional Connectivity (PDHC), a multivariate metric that quantifies the pattern-level distance between each individual's left- and right-hemisphere connectivity architecture. In over one thousand adults, PDHC showed high test-retest reliability, cross-atlas robustness, and strong individual specificity. Network analyses indicated that hemispheric similarity is anchored in conserved sensorimotor and subcortical systems, whereas higher-order networks drive divergence. Developmental data from infancy through early adulthood revealed a characteristic trajectory: dissimilarity declines sharply early in life and increases modestly thereafter. Twin and Turner syndrome samples further demonstrated moderate heritability and sensitivity to X-chromosome dosage. PDHC thus provides a reliable and individualized metric of hemispheric functional architecture, offering a scalable tool for probing lateralization across development, genetics, cognition, and clinical conditions.",

      "title": "Dual role of Spreading Depolarization in the epileptic focus",
      "content": "Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) are often associated with epileptic discharges. While SDs are traditionally thought contributing to the postictal depression and termination of epileptic discharges, seizures may also occur during SDs or may even follow SDs suggesting that interactions between SD and seizures are more complex. Here, we examined the interactions between SD and epileptic activity by spatially separating the epileptic focus and the site of SD initiation. Epileptic focus was induced by local intracortical injection of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP combined with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, whereas extrinsic SDs were evoked by distal high potassium application. We found that extrinsic SDs promoted seizure-like events (SLEs) when the SD wave approached the epileptic focus, followed by suppression of epileptic activity when SD spread through the focus. The timing of SLE relatively SD varied at different recordings sites, with SLEs occurring before, during or after SD arrival depending on electrode position along the trajectory of SD propagation between the SD initiation site and the epileptic focus. During intracortical recordings, the proconvulsive effects of SD were associated with a wave of pre-SD neuronal excitation reaching the epileptic focus. The epileptic focus per se also demonstrated a resistance to the SD invasion. Thus, the interactions between SD and epileptic focus are not limited to postictal depression, and SDs may also promote epileptic activity in the hyperexcitable cortex.",

      "title": "Causal inference and functional dynamics of a visuomotor network demonstrate excitatory/inhibitory alterations in Multiple Sclerosis",
      "content": "Balanced excitation and inhibition are fundamental for stable brain dynamics. In multiple sclerosis (MS), this balance is thought to be altered, yet its impact on the visuomotor network function and disease progression remains unclear. This study uses information from Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and The Virtual Brain (TVB) alongside clinical measures to provide a causal and network-level perspective on MS pathophysiology. We defined a visuomotor network based on previous work, including bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellar lobule VI (CR). We analysed data from 9 healthy volunteers (HV) and 17 people with MS (pwMS) who underwent multimodal MRI including a visually-guided variable grip-force event-related task and resting-state functional MRI, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging. Our DCM analysis indicated that the best-fitting model was the same for both groups, suggesting preserved visuomotor network architecture. However, pwMS showed altered effective connectivity during task (from SPL to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS) and rest (from V1 to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS; from SPL to M1, from M1 to SMAPMC, and from CR to V1: inhibitory in HV, excitatory in pwMS). During task execution, grip-force modulations revealed altered feedback connectivity patterns in pwMS as motor demand increased, indicating a shift from the positive coupling seen in HV to negative coupling across most connections. Effective connectivity alterations in task and resting-state fMRI were associated with clinical measures, including disability and motor reaction time. Connectivity changes involved visuomotor and cerebellar circuits and differed between task execution and rest, indicating context-specific network dynamics. Network-level simulations further linked reduced excitatory gain to slower responses, showing the role of excitation/inhibition balance in performing a visuomotor task. Together, these findings identify excitatory and inhibitory alterations as key mechanisms of network functional disruption in MS and demonstrate the potential of multiscale modelling to bridge neurophysiological alterations with clinical performance.",

      "content": "Adults are able to orient their attention between different (often fleeting) sensory cues that present to different senses (\"crossmodal attention\"), but we cannot assume that this is the case in early life. Here we report the findings of a study in which we probed the presence of tactile to visual crossmodal links in spatial attention using event related potentials (ERP) gathered from the scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) of 5- (n = 19) and 8-month-old (n = 19) infants. Whilst recording EEG, we presented 5- and 8-month-old participants with vibrotactile stimuli on one of their hands, followed by visual stimuli on the same (Congruent) or the opposite (Incongruent) hand, or no touch at all (No probe). During the presentation of these stimuli the infants' eyes were oriented centrally. We subtracted No probe trials from Congruent and Incongruent trials to yield visual evoked potentials (VEPs) free from the influence of prior somatosensory processing. Comparably to prior findings in adults, 8-month-olds' first negative component of the VEP was enhanced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the probe when the visual probe was spatially congruent with the tactile cue. No crossmodal effect was observed in the 5-month-olds, indicating developments in the crossmodal coordination of attention in the first year of life.",

      "title": "Effects of rTMS on swallowing function and neuroimaging features in post-stroke dysphagia",
      "content": "IntroductionDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is common after stroke and can lead to complications like malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and increased mortality. Recovery is driven by neural reorganization, yet traditional interventions focus on managing swallowing difficulties rather than restoring brain function. Neuromodulatory approaches like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show potential for promoting brain plasticity and recovery. While rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing after stroke, few studies have explored its neural mechanisms at the brain level, as opposed to focusing on motor-evoked potentials recorded from peripheral muscles.MethodsThis study examined the effects of 5\u202fHz rTMS on post-stroke dysphagia by targeting the contralesional mylohyoid cortical area. Resting-state fMRI was employed to investigate the neural correlates of rTMS effects. Local brain activity was measured using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and percentage amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), while network connectivity was assessed with graph theory analysis.ResultsrTMS reduced spontaneous activity in the contralesional middle frontal gyrus and putamen, and in the ipsilesional insula and middle frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), regions that were hyperactive at baseline in dysphagic patients. Altered network topology in the left medial superior frontal gyrus suggested connectivity reorganization.ConclusionThese preliminary findings support rTMS as a promising adjunct therapy for post-stroke dysphagia by inducing cortical plasticity, as demonstrated by changes in both regional activity and network topology. Further validation in studies with larger samples is needed.",

      "title": "Macroscopic quantum effects in the brain: new insights into the fundamental principle underlying conscious processes",
      "content": "Empirical findings indicate that conscious states are inextricably linked to long-range synchronized activity patterns that result from phase transitions and exhibit the key features of self-organized criticality. This article builds a bridge between these neurophysiological characteristics of consciousness and the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which provides the appropriate methodological resources for explaining the origin of phase transitions and critical dynamics. An essential ingredient of QED is a fluctuating ocean of energy, the ubiquitous electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF), consisting of a spectrum of normal modes. It can be deduced from QED-based model calculations that the resonant interaction of the ZPF with the glutamate pool of cortical microcolumns is an important prerequisite for the initiation of phase transitions, giving rise to macroscopic quantum effects that play a crucial role in modulating the activity of ion channels and regulating the neuronal firing rate. The firing rate of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons determines the excitatory-inhibitory balance, which has been identified as the essential control parameter for establishing and maintaining the critical regime. Thus, taking all available pieces of evidence into account, profound new insights take shape, namely, that self-organized criticality arises from a bottom-up orchestration process involving the ZPF and that the fundamental principle behind the formation of conscious states is the resonant coupling of the brain to the ZPF. This coupling causes an amplification of the dynamically relevant ZPF modes, suggesting that the ZPF holds the key to the understanding of consciousness and that the necessary condition for the formation of a conscious state is the selective excitation of ZPF modes. These insights pave the way for novel experimental paradigms designed to systematically manipulate conditions in the brain, thereby collecting new data that can be used to empirically substantiate the significance of resonant brain-ZPF interaction for the formation of conscious states.",
