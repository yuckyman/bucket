      "title": "Persistent enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability induced by transient divalent cation depletion",
      "content": "Fluctuations in external calcium concentration [Ca2+]e occur during the wake and sleep cycle and during intense neuronal activity. However, the incidence of these fluctuations on neuronal excitability is not precisely known. We show here that reducing divalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) concentrations from 1.3/0.8 to 0.6/0.4 mM during 15-30 minutes induces long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. LTP-IE induced by low divalent cations is associated with a hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold and constitutes a positive feed-back of brain activity. This plasticity requires Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), IP3 receptor (IP3R) and calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). In fact, LTP-IE was occluded in the presence of the calcilytic NPS-2143 and absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. In addition, inhibiting IP3R with 2-APB and CaMKII with kin considerably reduced LTP-IE magnitude. LTP-IE and synaptic potentiation (LTP) induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol were also found to depend on CaSR as they were totally absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was found to be reduced by ~35% following LTP induced by STDP. Importantly, this drop of spontaneous activity was not observed in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Taken together, these results show that CaSR plays a critical role in LTP-IE induced by low [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e and as well as in LTP of synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability induced by STDP.",

      "content": "Trauma is a main cause of psychiatric disorders. Approximately 24% of trauma-exposed individuals suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder throughout their lifetime, however, the vast majority of people are resilient. Why some people are resilient while others develop mental disorders in face of trauma in a short timescale? Here, we show that O2 actively initiates a cell-signaling pathway that regulates behavioral outcomes in response to traumatic stress. We found that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT neurons) projecting to the ventral caudate putamen and the ventral tegmental area exhibit distinct physiological patterns of O2 utilization. In response to traumatic stress, O2 utilization in these neurons changed individually, following either a susceptible or resilient pattern, thereby modulating corresponding behaviors. This O2 scaling was regulated by ferroptosis within the DRN5-HT neurons. Thus, we identify a previously unrecognized function of O2, opening an avenue for the treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders.",

      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "content": "The serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, shows potential for rapid and sustained antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.",

      "content": "A specific time window during which neural circuits undergo dramatic changes in response to individual experiences is known as the critical period (CP). Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.",

      "title": "SnapG: An Automated Tool for Myelin g-ratio Measurement with Batch Processing Capability",
      "content": "The g-ratio, calculated as the axon diameter divided by the total myelinated fiber diameter, is widely used to assess the degree of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Changes in g-ratios accompany demyelinating, hypomyelinating, and remyelinating conditions, and can also result from activity-dependent, adaptive myelination. Although manual tracing from electron micrographs has been the gold-standard to measure g-ratios, this process is laborious and limits throughput. To address this challenge, we developed SnapG, an automated and user friendly software tool to streamline g-ratio analysis from electron micrographs. SnapG implements an end to end pipeline for axon and myelin segmentation on EM images. The tool integrates robust segmentation and post processing steps to extract axon and fiber diameters and generates both per image and cohort level summary statistics. SnapG produces g-ratio distributions that agree well with expert manual annotations and established tools across imaging modalities. It reduces user intervention, supports large image and batch processing, and achieves faster processing times while delivering accurate, reproducible measurements. SnapG's automated reporting thereby facilitates high throughput analyses and improves consistency across experiments. SnapG can accelerate studies of myelin biology and provides a practical alternative to existing tools.",

Seemed like the right tool for the job, but it would have saved time if I'd built it from scratch myself.<p>The most interesting part was turning the labeled image data into predictions with pytorch. Claude wrote the initial script fairly quickly, but as these things go it required manual tweaking and second guessing myself on the images flagged as outliers. I'll admit I got embarrassingly far along before realizing that Claude hadn't enabled pytorch's GPU support; a real facepalm moment on my part.<p>For those curious, brave, or crazy enough to dive in the source code is available here under an MIT license:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MrEricSir/munimet.ro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/MrEricSir/munimet.ro</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637283\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637283</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! In the past few months my team and I have been working on Tusk Drift, a system that records real API traffic from your service, then replays those requests as deterministic tests. Outbound I/O (databases, HTTP calls, etc.) gets automatically mocked using the recorded data.<p>Problem we're trying to solve: Writing API tests is tedious, and hand-written mocks drift from reality. We wanted tests that stay realistic because they come from real traffic.<p>versus mocking libraries: Tools like VCR/Nock intercept HTTP within your tests. Tusk Drift records full request/response traces externally (HTTP, DB, Redis, etc.) and replays them against your running service, no test code or fixtures to write/maintain.<p>How it works:<p>1. Add a lightweight SDK (we currently support Python and Node.js)<p>2. Record traffic in any environment.<p>3. Run `tusk run`, the CLI sandboxes your service and serves mocks via Unix socket<p>We run this in CI on every PR. Also been using it as a test harness for AI coding agents, they can make changes, run `tusk run`, and get immediate feedback without needing live dependencies.<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli</a><p>Demo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo</a><p>Happy to answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
