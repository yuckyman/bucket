      "content": "<p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 25 November 2025; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02086-y\">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-02086-y</a></p>Gonadal hormones shape brain structure across the lifespan. Using dense sampling in two female participants with typical cycles, one with endometriosis, and one using oral contraceptives, we show that distinct hormonal milieus influence widespread, coordinated fluctuations in brain volume across the cycle. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond the \u2018typical\u2019 menstrual cycle to understand how hormones drive structural brain plasticity in different conditions.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with Django for a long time, and I love it's philosophy, the structure, the CLI, and how easy it is to spin up new apps.</p> <p>When I started using FastAPI, I loved the performance and simplicity, but I often find myself spending a lot of time just setting up the architecture.</p> <p>I decided to build a boilerplate for FastAPI + SQLAlchemy to bridge that gap. I call it <strong>Djast</strong>.</p> <p><strong>What is Djast</strong> Djast is essentially <strong>FastAPI + SQLAlchemy</strong>, but organized like a Django project. It is <strong>not</strong> a wrapper that hides FastAPI\u2019s internal logic. It\u2019s a project template designed to help you hit the ground running without reinventing the architecture every time.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Django-style CLI:</strong> It includes a <code>manage.py</code> that handles commands like <code>startapp</code> (to create modular apps), <code>makemigrations</code>, <code>migrate</code>, and <code>shell</code>.</li> <li><strong>Smart Migrations:</strong> It wraps Alembic to mimic the Django workflow (<code>makemigrations</code> / <code>migrate</code>). It even detects table/column renames interactively so you don't lose data, and warns you about dangerous operations.</li> <li><strong>Familiar ORM Wrapper:</strong> It uses standard async SQLAlchemy, but includes a helper to provide a Django-like syntax for common queries (e.g., <code>await Item.objects(session).get(id=1)</code>).</li> <li><strong>Pydantic Integration:</strong> A helper method to generate Pydantic schemas directly from your DB models (similar to <code>ModelForm</code> concepts) helps to keep your code DRY.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Shell:</strong> A pre-configured IPython shell that auto-imports your models and handles the async session for you.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> This is for Django developers who want to try FastAPI but feel &quot;homesick&quot; for the Django structure and awesome quality-of-life features, or for FastAPI developers who want a more opinionated, battle-tested project layout.</p> <p>I decided to share it in hope that this is as usefull to you as it is to me. I would also appreciate some feedback. If you have time to check it out, I\u2019d love to hear what you think about the structure or if there are features you think are missing.</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast</a> <strong>Quickstart:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgtGreg\"> /u/AgtGreg </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[comments]</a></span>",
