This effect reflects an individual\u2019s metacognitive control processes. Little is known if depressive pathologies modify the reactivity effect in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).MethodsThis study investigated the differences in the reactivity effect between 94 patients with MDD and 97 healthy controls (HCs), using a perceptual decision-making task and the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) analysis.Results and discussionThe results demonstrated that prompted CRs significantly prolonged RTs in both groups. However, prompted CRs improved decision accuracy in HCs, this effect was absent in the MDD group. DDM analysis revealed increased decision thresholds under CR conditions for both groups. Crucially, a significant group\u00d7condition interaction emerged for drift rate (v), with HCs demonstrating enhanced evidence accumulation speed compared to MDD patients. These findings indicate impaired metacognitive reactivity effects in MDD through confidence monitoring, highlighting deficits in metacognitive monitoring and control processes associated with depression.",

      "title": "Distinct neurogenic dynamics of cortico-cortical neuronal subtypes in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex",
      "content": "In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the birthdates of excitatory projection neurons are closely linked to their laminar positions, which are often associated with distinct long-range projection targets. Although broad relationships between neurogenic timing, laminar position, and projection patterns are well established, the degree to which birthdate specifies projection identity within the same cortical layer remains unclear. In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are relatively evenly distributed throughout layer 2/3, whereas those projecting to medial areas are biased toward more superficial sublayers. To determine whether these projection identities are linked to neurogenic timing, we combined EdU birthdating with retrograde viral tracing. Notably, we found that V1 layer 2/3 neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are preferentially born at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) compared to E16.5, whereas V1 neurons projecting to medial higher visual areas show no significant birthdate bias between E15.5 and E16.5. These findings suggest that distinct cortico-cortical projection subtypes in layer 2/3 are generated on different temporal schedules, linking neurogenic timing to fine-scale projection identity.",

      "title": "Psychosocial factors associated with speech perception in older adult cochlear implant users: a scoping review",
      "content": "BackgroundThe population of older adults (OAs) is significantly increasing, and with that is the reality of OAs having hearing loss (HL). Although there is no hearing screening for adults, some OAs do consult their audiologist or otologist and receive a cochlear implant (CI). There are several studies showing that CI surgery in OAs is safe, and post-CI speech perception is similar to younger adults. However, there is little knowledge about what psychosocial factors may be associated with speech perception outcomes in OAs. The objective of this scoping review is to address these open questions.MethodsThis scoping review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies in English and German published between Jan 2020 and Jan 2025 reporting on psychosocial factors relating to speech perception outcomes in OAs with CIs.Results6/94 studies met the inclusion criteria. The six included publications considered the associations of quality of life, frailty, depression, and family support on speech perception in OAs with CIs. The association between these factors and sound perception was variable.ConclusionAlthough CIs are not uncommon as a treatment for HL in OAs, few studies have addressed the associations of psychosocial factors with speech perception in this population, or vice versa. More research needs to be conducted to determine these psychosocial factors and their impact on speech perception to better care for OAs with CIs.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Fully endoscopic MVD for HFS offers wide visualization of the neurovascular conflict area and minimizes brain injury caused by retraction. Once technical proficiency is achieved, surgical outcomes are favorable and complications are low. Despite the drawbacks such as a slight sense of vertigo during use and high cost, the 3D endoscope provides a stereoscopic view. More research is essential to verify its role in MVD surgery.",

While ocular screening of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine is important, retinal toxicity with a low dose and short duration of use remains rare. Clinicians must retain a broad differential diagnosis in the assessment of patients with bull's eye maculopathy.",

So far, although numerous image deblurring and compression-artifact removal methods have been proposed respectively, the research for explicit handling blur and compression-artifact coexisting degradation image (BCDI) is rare. In the BCDI, image contents will be damaged more seriously, especially for edges and texture details. Therefore, the restoration of the BCDI is a more severe...",
