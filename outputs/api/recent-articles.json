      "title": "Scaffolding Creativity: How Divergent and Convergent LLM Personas Shape Human Machine Creative Problem-Solving",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.26490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona, while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.\n  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing. Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model, demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.\n  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26265v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values. However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26251v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences. Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience and engagement.",

      "title": "Linking Heterogeneous Data with Coordinated Agent Flows for Social Media Analysis",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.26172v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data, capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26069v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI) communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions, hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI) model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive, discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.",

However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging, especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26015v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with 16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs, but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.",

      "title": "Reciprocal regulation of the H3 histamine receptor in Rett syndrome and MECP2 Duplication 1 syndrome: implications for therapeutic development",
      "content": "Rett syndrome (RTT) and MECP2 Duplication syndrome (MDS) are disorders caused by reciprocal decreases and increases, respectively, in expression of the methyl reader protein, Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator that induces changes in the expression of thousands of genes. We previously performed an mRNA expression profiling study of the temporal cortex region from a cohort of autopsy samples from patients diagnosed with RTT and corresponding age, postmortem interval, and sex-matched controls. These studies identified a significant reduction in the expression of the histamine H3 receptor (HRH3) in RTT patients compared to controls. In the current manuscript, we expand this H3 receptor profiling to additional RTT patient brain samples representing distinct disease mutations and confirm significantly reduced levels of H3 receptor expression in the majority of patients compared to controls. Using mouse models of RTT and MDS, we observed reciprocal changes in H3 receptor expression across various brain areas, with Hrh3 expression being reduced in RTT model animals and increased in a mouse model of MDS. We then tested the hypothesis that phenotypes in these mouse models would be sensitive to an H3 receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively. This point is particularly salient for MDS, as there are no approved treatments available; encouragingly, however, the H3 antagonist/inverse agonist pitolisant (Wakix) has recently been approved for the treatment of narcolepsy, and we sought here to determine if there was potential to repurpose pitolisant for MDS. We evaluated both a small molecule agonist of the H3 receptor, (R)-[alpha]-methylhistamine (RAMH), and pitolisant in RTT and MDS models, respectively, to determine impacts on phenotypes in these disease models. Our results show that RAMH significantly impacted an anxiety phenotype in mice modeling RTT (MecpNull/+), but pitolisant had no effect on the behaviors examined here in MDS animals (MECP2Tg1).",

Many investigators still perform these quantifications by hand, which is time consuming and prone to bias. Cellpose is an open-source Python package that can perform cellular segmentation and holds promise for automating somal analyses. Here, we designed a custom script incorporating the Cellpose package and custom-trained Cellpose models that are capable of automatic characterization and quantification of RGC somas. Our script, using our models, is capable of automatically counting RGC somas, along with characterizing RGC somal size. Further, we show that Cellpose can quantify RGCs using multiple cell-type specific markers and has the potential to quantify RGCs across the entire retina. Together, our custom Cellpose models and script which generates and analyzes Cellpose outputs provides a powerful tool for all-in-one RGC somal analysis.",

Here we report the protein expression and cell type tropism of modified saRNA-LNPs, encoding fluorescent proteins, when injected in the mammalian brain. saRNA encapsulated in an LNP formulation comprising ALC-0315 (present in Comirnaty) efficiently mediates robust and long-lasting protein expression in brain cells beyond five weeks, with detectable expression in some neurons at three months. hm5C saRNA substantially outperforms N1m{Psi} mRNA. Intriguingly, in addition to transfecting astrocytes and neurons at the injection site, saRNA-LNPs labels neurons retrogradely.

      "content": "In the midst of an opioid epidemic, opioid use disorder (OUD) can lead to significant clinical impairment or distress (such as opioid dependence and/or addiction) and overdose deaths. Therefore, it is significant to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of OUD and identify more effective therapies. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids are self-organized 3D tissues and mimic in vivo human organs. Increasingly, human-specific features of opioid abuse are being investigated using emerging brain organoids, which faithfully model the key functional, structural and biological complexities of neural tissues. However, a significant limitation of brain organoids is the absence of microglia which plays a fundamental role in OUD-related remodeling of neural circuits. In this pilot study, using hiPSC KOLF2.1J cell line, we developed our approach for generating both midbrain organoid and microglia and verified that our midbrain organoid was successfully integrated with microglia. We found that chronic exposure to morphine triggers key elements of immune responses including increased TNF signaling and downregulation of sirtuin3 (Sirt3, a mitochondrial protein, preventing oxidative stress) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, located in the mitochondrial matrix) in microglia-organoid co-cultures. Our findings suggest that immunocompetent midbrain organoids provide excellent models with which to study human-specific mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. By combining disease relevance with scalability, the model system can be utilized as an effective tool for drug screening and toxicity testing.",

      "title": "Characterization of cutaneous reflexes elicited from saphenous nerve stimulation",
      "content": "Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a chronic neuropathic condition that affects amputees. Cutaneous reflexes (CRs), mediated by spinal interneuronal circuits, represent a potential pathway linking non-nociceptive input to nociceptive modulation that could be targeted with neuromodulatory techniques such as operant conditioning. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel method for eliciting CRs from proximal muscles via saphenous nerve stimulation to enable future applications in individuals with PLP. We recruited 14 healthy adults and elicited CRs in the rectus femoris muscle via transcutaneous stimulation of the saphenous nerve at multiple stimulation intensities below their pain thresholds. We evaluated the consistency and reliability of CR response latencies and magnitudes, comparing the symmetry between the bilaterally (e.g. right and left legs). We found that CRs could be reliably elicited 50-100ms post-stimulus using saphenous stimulation and that responses were reliable at stimulation intensities below pain thresholds. Furthermore, we found the CR responses were relatively symmetrical in our healthy adult population. This study is the first of its kind to show that proximal (vs distal) CRs could be consistently elicited through the saphenous nerve stimulation. These findings imply that proximal CRs maybe a feasible target for ne",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Electrophysiological and behavioural responses to consonant and dissonant piano chords as standardised affective stimuli",
      "content": "Although the difference between consonance and dissonance has raised interest for decades in various fields of science, isolated chords are still underutilised as standardised affective stimuli in neuroscience. In the present study, we assessed whether consonant, dissonant, and neutral sounds evoked different subjective and neurophysiological responses associated with the emotional experience. For the first time, we conducted a comprehensive study of piano timbre chord perception, combining behavioural assessments, event-related potentials (ERPs), frequency-domain electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of amplitude, neurodynamic (longrange temporal correlations (LRTC)) factors, and source analysis. In an experiment, 30 participants rated the valence of sounds (consonance, dissonance, neutral) whilst simultaneously undergoing EEG recordings. At the behavioural level, a stable valence gradient was revealed: consonance was perceived as pleasant, dissonance as unpleasant, and the neutral group of stimuli as neutral. Analysis of ERPs revealed differences in response across three time windows (90\u2013110\u202fms, 190\u2013210\u202fms, 290\u2013310\u202fms) and activation of frontotemporal and temporoparietal areas during the processing of dissonant chords. At the level of frequency and neurodynamic indices (gamma and beta bands amplitudes and LRTC), we demonstrated that classification accuracy depends on the interaction between chord type and the EEG\u2019s amplitude- and scale-invariant characteristics for dissonant and neutral stimuli. These results provide evidence that isolated chords evoke differentiated emotional and cognitive responses, highlighting their potential utility as affective stimuli in future studies.",

      "title": "CPRSCA-ResNet: a novel ResNet-based model with Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention for EEG-based seizure detection",
      "content": "Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder caused by abnormal discharges of brain neurons, characterized by transient disturbances in consciousness, motor function, behavior, or sensation. Recurrent seizures severely impair patients\u2019 cognitive and physiological functions and increase the risk of accidental injury and premature death. Currently, clinical diagnosis of epilepsy mainly relies on manual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, but traditional methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to noise interference, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate automated detection models. To address this, a novel Channel-Partitioned Resolution Spatial-Channel Attention (CPRSCA) mechanism was proposed in this study, and a CPRSCA-ResNet automatic seizure detection model was developed based on the ResNet-34 architecture. By incorporating fine-grained channel partitioning, multi-scale feature fusion, and multi-dimensional attention mechanisms, the proposed approach significantly enhances the precise representation of complex EEG features. Patient-dependent and patient-independent seizure detection experiments were conducted on the public CHB-MIT dataset and two local hospital datasets (JHCH and JHMCHH). The results show that, in patient-dependent experiments, the proposed model achieved accuracies of 99.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.09%, 96.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.64%, and 98.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.75% on the three datasets, while in patient-independent experiments, accuracies reached 78.71\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.06%, 87.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f15.32%, and 89.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.87%, respectively. These metrics consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the effectiveness and generalizability of the CPRSCA mechanism for automatic seizure detection. In summary, the proposed method provides an efficient, robust, and highly generalizable technical solution for auxiliary clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, with the potential to substantially reduce the burden of manual EEG interpretation and improve the diagnostic efficiency for patients with epilepsy.",
