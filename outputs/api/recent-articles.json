      "title": "Hippocampal functional connectivity changes associated with active and lecture-based physics learning",
      "content": "Introductory university physics courses often face the dual challenge of introducing students to new physics concepts while also addressing their preconceived notions that conflict with scientific principles. Active learning pedagogical approaches, which employ constructivist principles and emphasize active participation in the learning process, have been shown to be effective in teaching complex physics concepts. However, while the behavioral effects of constructivist methodologies are largely understood, the neurobiological underpinnings that facilitate this process remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed students enrolled in either an active learning or lecture-based physics course before and after a 15-week semester of learning and examined changes in hippocampal whole-brain connectivity. We focused on the hippocampus given its critical role in learning and memory. Our findings revealed that hippocampal connectivity with brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes decreased over time, regardless of instructional approach. Results also indicated that active learning students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with parietal, cerebellar, and frontal regions, reflecting experiential learning based on constructivist principles, whereas lecture-based students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus, suggesting learning through passive observation. Our findings demonstrate that while some aspects of hippocampal functional connectivity may decrease over time, active vs. passive learning may preferentially enhance hippocampal connectivity during physics learning.",

      "title": "Exogenous spatial attention is functional in paralytic strabismics",
      "content": "IntroductionThe absence of exogenous cueing effects in patients with paralytic strabismus has been cited as evidence for an obligate linkage between movement execution and attentional allocation.MethodsThe present study challenges this interpretation through two experiments that measured the impact of visual cues, intended to facilitate or inhibit shifts of spatial attention, on the latencies of target-directed responses. By including a no-cue control condition, we assessed both the presence and direction of cue-induced attentional modulation.ResultsOur results show that all patients\u2019 patterns of saccadic (Experiment I) and keypress (Experiment II) response latencies showed classic signatures of cue-target interactions: movements initiated in response to targets spatially proximate to cues were initiated fastest whereas movements initiated toward targets spatially distal from cues were initiated slowest. This trend held true when grouping latencies by cue-saccade offset to account for small errors in saccade landing position in Experiment I. Though the patients\u2019 data exhibited small degrees of idiosyncrasy, most patients\u2019 mean normalized latencies also fell within the range of latencies observed in non-strabismic participants.DiscussionThese findings support the notion that premotor structures may program attentional shifts in an effector-independent manner and motivate future investigations to explore how, not if, exogenous spatial attention is deployed in paralytic strabismics.",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",
