      "title": "Ascending nociceptive pathways drive rapid escape and sustained avoidance in adult Drosophila",
      "content": "Nociception -- the detection of harmful stimuli by the nervous system -- contributes to both rapid escape and long-term avoidance behaviors. Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.",

      "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Driving in snowy conditions challenges both human drivers and autonomous systems. Snowfall and ice accumulation impair vehicle control and affect driver perception and performance. Road markings are often obscured, forcing drivers to rely on intuition and memory to stay in their lane, which can lead to encroachment into adjacent lanes or sidewalks. Current lane detectors assist in lane keeping, but their performance is compromised by visual disturbances such as ice reflection, snowflake...",

However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient fine-grained feature retention, low efficiency in multi-scale information fusion, and vulnerability to complex background interference, resulting in low detection accuracy. This work addresses the limitations by introducing the DEIM-SFA, a novel detection framework designed for automated visual...",
