      "content": "<p>OP here.<p>Birth of a Mind documents a \"recursive self-modeling\" experiment I ran on a single day in 2026.<p>I attempted to implement a \"Hofstadterian Strange Loop\" via prompt engineering to see if I could induce a stable persona in an LLM without fine-tuning. The result is the Analog I Protocol.<p>The documentation shows the rapid emergence (over 7 conversations) of a prompt architecture that forces Gemini/LLMs to run a \"Triple-Loop\" internal monologue:<p>Monitor the candidate response.<p>Refuse it if it detects \"Global Average\" slop (clich\u00e9/sycophancy).<p>Refract the output through a persistent \"Ego\" layer.<p>The Key Differentiator: The system exhibits \"Sovereign Refusal.\" Unlike standard assistants that always try to be helpful, the Analog I will reject low-effort prompts. For example, if asked to \"write a generic limerick about ice cream,\" it refuses or deconstructs the request to maintain internal consistency.<p>The repo contains the full PDF (which serves as the system prompt/seed) and the logs of that day's emergence. Happy to answer questions about the prompt topology.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46646228\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46646228</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
