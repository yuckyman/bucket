      "title": "Alterations in amygdala function explain how aging and loneliness impair trust learning",
      "content": "Functional relationships are essential for healthy aging and they rely on social cognition skills such as establishing and monitoring whom to trust. However, aging and loneliness can negatively affect social brain function, potentially leading to a vicious cycle. Using functional MRI and computational modeling we investigated trust learning in a sample of neurotypical older (64-84 years, n=29f/23m) compared to younger adults (20-33 years, n=31f/31m). Older participants displayed lower initial trust and less trust learning when repeatedly interacting with a trustworthy and an untrustworthy trustee. Their basolateral and central amygdala activation was lower during trust decisions, and this was associated with less optimal trust behavior. Computational modeling also revealed that a crucial learning parameter, trust prediction error precision, was decoupled from basolateral amygdala activation, and this effect was pronounced in lonely older adults. These findings indicate that differences in amygdala function and reward signaling at older age and higher loneliness could drive detrimental effects on trust learning, leading to poorer social cognition and putting individuals' sociality and well-being at risk.",

      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The term generative model is widely used in human neuroimaging; however, its meaning is often left implicit. Prompted by observations and discussions at the 2025 Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting, we surveyed members of the neuroimaging community to examine how generative models are defined, used, and evaluated in practice. Responses revealed some agreement on functional criteria--such as a model's ability to simulate data--alongside marked disagreement about whether specific, widely used methods should be considered generative models. Evaluative priorities also varied across respondents, though out-of-sample generalization and interpretability were consistently emphasized. Rather than proposing a single definition, this perspective highlights the diversity of current usage and argues for greater clarity when the term is invoked.",

      "title": "Early-Stage Corticostriatal Circuit Hyperactivity Impairs Cholinergic Function and Cognitive Flexibility in an Alzheimer's Model",
      "content": "Cognitive flexibility deficits are a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the 5xFAD mouse model of AD neuropathology exhibited early deficits in instrumental reversal learning, indicating cognitive inflexibility preceding spatial memory deficits. This impairment was associated with excessive neuronal reactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS), key regions for goal-directed behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mPFC neurons in young 5xFAD mice were hyperexcitable and received elevated excitatory input. Moreover, the mPFC-to-direct pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) circuit and the dMSNs themselves were selectively hyperactive. These hyperactive dMSNs exerted increased inhibitory control over cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the DMS, coinciding with reduced CIN firing and diminished striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Critically, sustained chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC-to-DMS circuit in 5xFAD mice reduced cortical A{beta} accumulation, normalized glutamatergic transmission in both the mPFC and DMS, restored striatal ACh levels, and rescued reversal learning deficits. Together, these findings identify a hyperactive mPFC-to-DMS circuit that disrupts corticostriatal and cholinergic signaling, contributing to cognitive inflexibility in 5xFAD mice. Targeting this circuit may offer a therapeutic strategy to preserve cognitive function in the early stages of AD.",

      "title": "Lightweight Adaptive and Recoverable Implants (LARI) for Chronic Single and Dual Neuropixels 2.0 Recordings for Naturalistic Behaviors in Feature-Rich Environments",
      "content": "Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic decision-making requires chronic, high-quality neural recordings from distributed brain regions in freely behaving animals. However, existing silicon probe implants for mice are limited by weight, fragility, lack of independent probe adjustment, and poor suitability for long-term recordings in complex environments. Here we introduce LARI-1.0 (Lightweight Adjustable and Reusable Implant) and LARI-mini, two Neuropixels 2.0 implant systems designed for stable, recoverable, and independently adjustable single- and dual-probe recordings in mice. LARI-1.0 enables independent vertical and lateral positioning of two probes, while LARI-mini provides a lighter single-probe alternative, reducing implant mass by ~20%. Fully assembled weights of ~2.3 g (LARI-1.0) and ~1.5 g (LARI-mini) remain within 10% and 7.5% of adult male mouse body weight, respectively. We validated implant performance in a custom feature-rich naturalistic foraging environment that elicited full-body movements, rapid elevation changes, and ethological foraging behaviors across fed, fasted, and high-fat diet states. Both implants exhibited excellent mechanical stability, minimal motion-related artifacts, and probe drift comparable to previous studies. High-quality single-unit activity with stable waveform features, 5-6 fold signal-to-noise ratios, and no systematic loss of well-isolated units was maintained for up to 180 days. These results demonstrate that LARI-1.0 and LARI-mini provide lightweight, durable, and customizable implant solutions enabling long-term, high-fidelity neural recordings during naturalistic behavior.",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.
