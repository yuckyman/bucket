      "title": "Neural mechanisms of cognitive conflict: processing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe rapid spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised important questions about how individuals evaluate false information, particularly when it conflicts with strongly held prior attitudes. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of vaccine-related misinformation may clarify why such beliefs persist despite corrective information.MethodsUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined neural responses to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and factual information in vaccine-receptive participants (N\u202f=\u202f29). During scanning, participants were presented with a series of vaccine-related statements\u2014both accurate and false\u2014and indicated their level of agreement. Analyses focused on the influence of prior beliefs and attitude congruence on neural activation.ResultsContrary to our hypotheses, exposure to attitude-incongruent misinformation did not elicit significant activation in emotional processing regions such as the amygdala or precuneus. However, when participants made attitude-incongruent responses\u2014endorsing misinformation or rejecting accurate information\u2014we observed increased activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), regions associated with decision-making, moral reasoning, memory integration, and cognitive control.DiscussionThese findings suggest that conflicts between incoming information and prior attitudes engage effortful, higher-order cognitive systems rather than affective processing. Resolving such conflicts appears to rely on decision-making and control mechanisms that manage uncertainty and cognitive dissonance. Due to recruitment limitations, the present study focused exclusively on vaccine-receptive individuals. Future research should investigate whether vaccine-resistant individuals exhibit similar or distinct neural patterns, which may provide further insight into the persistence of misinformation in the context of negative prior attitudes.",

      "content": "IntroductionSleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by nocturnal seizures that predominantly arise during sleep, featuring complex motor behaviors. Pathogenic variants in the nitrogen permease regulator-like 3 (NPRL3) gene and other regulators of the mTOR pathway have been linked to diverse epilepsy phenotypes, including SHE. SHE is challenging to diagnose due to its diverse presentations, overlap with non-epileptic sleep disorders, and semiological similarities to functional/dissociative seizures (FDS).Case reportWe present the case of a 61-year-old woman with a lifelong history of nocturnal paroxysmal events and focal epilepsy. She experienced stereotyped nocturnal episodes of focal motor seizures with retained consciousness, characterized by hyperkinetic activity and asymmetric posturing. Despite multiple antiseizure medications (ASMs), only carbamazepine (CBZ) provided long-term seizure freedom. Genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the NPRL3 gene.DiscussionThis case highlights the diagnostic challenges of SHE and the importance of genetic testing in drug-resistant epilepsy. The identified NPRL3 mutation shows the genetic complexity of SHE and its implications for treatment.",

      "title": "Decoding the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in early visual cortex",
      "content": "The ''bouba-kiki'' effect, or sound symbolism, is the non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and visual shapes, in which words like ''bouba'' are consistently associated with round shapes, and ''kiki'' with spiky shapes. Despite robust behavioral evidence for sound symbolic associations, it is still unclear whether they are a linguistic epiphenomenon or manifest themselves as distinct sensory representations in the human brain. Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses, we show that, in the absence of visual input, round and spiky sound symbolic words elicit distinct neural representations, not only in auditory and speech processing regions, but also in parietal and even early visual cortex including V1. These neural representations correlate with behavioural shape judgements of sound-symbolic words, as revealed by representational similarity analyses. Our findings suggest a potential functional mechanism for sound symbolism: phonological features of sound symbolic words are represented in auditory and speech processing regions and linked to cross-modal shape representations in parietal and early visual regions, which in turn lead to sound symbolic perceptual judgements. Thus, our results provide evidence for a neural mechanism underlying the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in the human brain.",
