      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Obesity, a major global health issue, results from disrupted energy balance driven by chronic hypothalamic inflammation and altered intercellular communication. Among the diverse cells orchestrating this regulation, specialized ependymal cells at the brain-blood interface called tanycytes have emerged as key modulators, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they influence surrounding cells remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Annexin A1 (ANXA1) as a tanycyte-derived anti-inflammatory signal whose expression, localization, and secretion are dynamically regulated by nutritional state and altered under high-fat diet. During positive energy balance, ANXA1 is secreted in CD9-positive extracellular vesicles (EV), remodeling hypothalamic networks by altering microglial morphology, synaptic density, and neuronal activation. These EV-mediated effects extend systemically to regulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and overall energy balance. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tanycyte-microglia-neuron signaling axis and highlight EV-mediated glial communication as a potential therapeutic target in obesity-associated neuroinflammation.",

      "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a convergent hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and represents a promising biomarker for early diagnosis and therapy. However, current in vitro assays rely on fluorescence or electron microscopy, which are invasive, low-throughput, and incompatible with longitudinal analysis. Here, we present a noninvasive framework by integrating label-free optical diffraction tomography (ODT) with organelle-aware representation learning to detect subtle mitochondrial dysfunction in live human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. Through virtual staining of the nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria, we establish two complementary and interpretable classification pipelines: a deep learning model with organelle-aware encoder and a logistic regression model on morphometric descriptors. Both models achieve approximately 85% accuracy: the deep model provides end-to-end prediction with minimal feature engineering, whereas the logistic regression model offers a more interpretable, feature-based approach. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of ODT-based organelle-resolved virtual staining in live human neurons, establishing a scalable, non-invasive platform for mitochondrial disease modeling, drug discovery, and neurodegeneration research.",
