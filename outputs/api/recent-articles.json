      "title": "TDP-43 suppression of ATP8A2 cryptic splicing implicates phosphatidylserine-driven neuroinflammation in ALS/FTD",
      "content": "Inappropriate externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is a candidate mechanism of pathogenic neuroinflammation, a critical driver of neurodegenerative disease. ATP8A2, a flippase that maintains PS on the plasma membrane inner leaflet, is mutated in both Wabbler- lethal mice and patients with the ataxia syndrome CAMRQ4. Here, we identify ATP8A2 as a target of TDP-43 cryptic exon suppression, and demonstrate that ATP8A2 loss leads to immune-mediated neurodegeneration. ATP8A2 splicing is significantly dysregulated following TDP-43 depletion in human neurons and in brains of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD). In mice, Atp8a2 loss increases PS exposure and promotes neuroinflammation. Depletion of peripheral macrophages rescues motor axon degeneration and doubles Atp8a2 knockout mouse lifespan, while depletion of both peripheral macrophages and central microglia quadruples lifespan and improves coordination. Hence, ATP8A2 is a pathologically relevant TDP-43 target and inhibition of phagocytic immune cell attack against neurons is a potential treatment for patients with CAMRQ4 and ALS-FTD.",

      "title": "Negative-Valence Neurons in the Larval Zebrafish Pallium",
      "content": "An organism's survival depends on the rapid classification of sensory events as either harmful or beneficial. In mammals, this computation is partially performed by neurons in the amygdala that respond to signals with negative or positive valence. The larval zebrafish pallium is thought to contain homologs of the mammalian amygdala, isocortex, and hippocampus; however, the signals encoded by pallial neurons remain largely uncharacterized. Using two-photon light sheet microscopy to image 7-9 day old zebrafish that express pan-neuronal GCaMP6s, we recorded calcium dynamics throughout the brain while presenting a panel of strongly aversive stimuli, infrared heat, electric shock, and a whole-field looming shadow, together with milder threats including vibration, loud sound, light transitions, and a partial looming stimulus. A compact cluster of neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal pallium (Rl) responded vigorously to strongly noxious and fully looming stimuli, but not to the milder cues. In contrast, neurons in the ventromedial pallium and habenula responded to all stimuli tested. Rl neurons are marked by high expression of tiam2a, suggesting that they could be accessed genetically. Our results identify a dedicated negative valence locus in the teleost pallium and underscore evolutionary conservation of valence coding circuits.",

      "title": "Visual perceptual learning enhances functional connectivity in retinotopic space",
      "content": "Repeated exposure to perceptual tasks improves behavioral performance. Several neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for such perceptual learning. Computational modeling suggests that plasticity in the connectivity between cortical sites may be responsible, by increasing the fidelity with which task-relevant information is transmitted through sensory hierarchies. Here we explore this theory in humans using fMRI, testing the hypothesis that perceptual learning at one location in space will increase functional connectivity between voxels in visual areas that are tuned to that retinotopic location. Participants learned to detect one of two novel visual shape contours embedded in a noisy background in different visual quadrants. At baseline, there was no difference in behavioral sensitivity for the two shapes, nor a difference in functional connectivity between voxels in V1 and V4 responsive to the retinotopic locations of the two shapes. After training, there was a robust and selective improvement in perceptual detection of the trained shape relative to the control shape, along with increased functional connectivity between V1 and V4 voxels coding for the location of the trained shape in retinotopic space. Moreover, this increase in functional connectivity for the trained versus control shape predicted the improvement in behavioral sensitivity across participants. These results are consistent with the proposal that perceptual learning alters network dynamics so as to enhance the processing of behaviorally relevant information.",

      "content": "Plasma pTau217, an emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker, may reflect a synaptic response to {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques before cortical tangle formation, but the broader biological processes at play remain unclear. Using whole blood RNAseq, we sought to identify gene expression associated with plasma pTau217 and to determine whether APOE{epsilon}4, sex, and neocortical A{beta}-PET burden further amplify these associations in 724 participants from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) Studies. 1,540 genes were moderated by A{beta}-PET, and 772 genes were moderated by both A{beta}-PET and sex. Our findings include genes previously associated with AD (e.g., TREML2) and implicate biological functions such as chromatin remodeling, lipid signaling, and RNA processing that interact with A{beta}-PET and sex to impact plasma pTau217. Our results underscore the complexity of molecular mechanisms that can be linked to plasma pTau217, particularly in the context of elevated A{beta}-PET.",

These built-in features required the project running a thread-safe python process that used libs like transformers, torch, safetensors, etc. 500M in dependencies, not to mention all the security vulnerabilities in the dep tree. Not hating on python, but our GH project was flagged with all sorts of issues.</p> <p>Those models are loaded as a separate out-of-process server via ollama/lama.cpp which you all know are built in C++/Go. Lighter, faster and safer. And ONLY if the developer uses these features of the product. This meant 9000 lines of less code, a total start time of &lt;2 seconds (vs 30+ seconds), etc.</p> <p>Why archgw? So that you can build AI agents in any language or framework and offload the plumbing work in AI (like agent routing/hand-off, guardrails, zero-code logs and traces, and a unified API for all LLMs) to a durable piece of infrastructure, deployed as a sidecar.</p> <p>Proud of this release, so sharing \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>P.S Sample demos, the CLI and some tests still use python because would be most convenient for developers to interact with the project. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdditionalWeb107\"> /u/AdditionalWeb107 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
      "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

      "title": "Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Enhances Ca2+-Dependent Electrical Activity in Lateral Cochlear Efferents",
      "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",

      "title": "Joint Population Coding and Temporal Coherence Link an Attended Talkers Voice and Location Features in Naturalistic Multi-talker Scenes",
      "content": "<p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>",

      "title": "Motor Control Processes Moderate Visual Working Memory Gating",
      "content": "<p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>",

      "title": "Origins of the Auditory Brainstem Response in Mice Using Source Localization of Topographic Multichannel EEG",
      "content": "<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<sub>0</sub>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>",

      "title": "Altered Electrophysiology and Transcriptome of GnRH Neurons in Middle-Aged Female Mice",
      "content": "<p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>",
