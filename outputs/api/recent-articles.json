      "title": "Area MT carries acceleration information in a quickly and directly decodable representation",
      "content": "We sought to better understand the neural representation of visual motion acceleration. A straightforward estimation of acceleration would involve calculating the rate of change of velocity, which itself would be calculated from change in position over time. As it is well-established that neurons in area MT encode velocity, the brain could thus indirectly estimate acceleration by calculating the change in MT's velocity representations. An alternate mechanism, however, could operate more rapidly and directly. In this case, the brain could exploit interactions between MT's standard motion encoding and idiosyncratic temporal dynamics of neural responses. Such direct decoding would thus exploit nonlinearities usually ignored in studies of MT coding. We tested between these two theories by measuring from ensembles of MT neurons while two male awake fixating macaques viewed linearly accelerating motion stimuli. Direct decoding of acceleration from MT was possible on faster time scales, and could be done with higher fidelity, than indirect decoding. Distinct motion acceleration information could thus be efficiently read out from rich and heterogeneous MT ensemble responses, regardless of the mechanisms that give rise to various forms of motion tuning that it exhibits. A similar analysis of activity in the medial superior temporal area (MST) did not suggest this later stage of motion processing has a more refined acceleration representation. Together, these results suggest that the brain may opportunistically exploit nonlinear idiosyncrasies of neural responses to efficiently extract behaviorally relevant information on fast time scales, instead of performing explicit calculation of some variables.",

      "title": "Alpha-synuclein fibrils induce budding of mitochondrial-derived vesicles",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of synucleinopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Several lines of evidence indicate the involvement of mitochondria in the disease pathology. Despite extensive study, the link between alpha-synuclein aggregation and mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity remains not fully understood. Using high-resolution imaging with electron microscopy, we examined cells exposed to alpha-synuclein fibrils vs control cells with a focus on mitochondria. We found that upon exposure to alpha-synuclein fibrils, mitochondria increase in size, cristae structure gets defects, and mitochondria enhance the budding of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). MDV formation reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism reminiscent of bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) biogenesis. Structural proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry corroborates this microscopy observation by identifying changes in multiple proteins that regulate cristae structure, MDV formation, and trafficking. Our results provide a new link between alpha-synuclein and mitochondria and identify novel pathways responding to alpha-synuclein aggregates, particularly that alpha-synuclein directly triggers MDV generation. The processes we detected could be of interest for diagnostics and potential therapeutic interventions.",

      "title": "Optic nerve regeneration requires the intracellular domain of LIFRa/CD118",
      "content": "Identifying cell-autonomous and non-autonomous factors that govern retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs) ability to extend axons is an important step in developing therapies to achieve recovery after optic nerve injury. Here we report that the intracellular domain of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR/CD118) is essential for mature RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons independent of the cognate ligand (LIF) and other therapies. Overexpression of LIFR in adult RGCs induces neurite outgrowth in cultured RGCs and axon regeneration in vivo while strongly amplifying RGCs' response to LIF itself and to unrelated growth factors. Conversely, in loss-of-function studies, down-regulation of LIFR eliminates the pro-regenerative effects of Pten deletion and other potent stimuli. LIFR bidirectionally regulates the constitutive activity of the MAP kinase pathway, in contrast to LIF itself, which primarily activates pSTAT3. Expression of a truncated LIFR lacking the extracellular domain is sufficient to promote axon regeneration and selectively increases the survival of particular RGC subtypes, placing the LIFR intracellular domain as an essential, cell-autonomous regulator of optic nerve regeneration.",

      "title": "Deep Learning of Brain-Behavior Dimensions Identifies Transdiagnostic Biotypes in Youth with ADHD and Anxiety Disorders",
      "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in youth and are characterized by substantial heterogeneity and frequent co-occurrence. This transdiagnostic complexity challenges conventional diagnostic frameworks that rely on symptom-based categories, which often obscure underlying dimensional and neurobiological mechanisms and offer limited neurobiological specificity. To address these issues, we developed a deep learning-based brain-behavior modeling framework that integrates clinically salient functional connectivity with cognitive and behavioral measures to identify interpretable dimensions and biologically grounded subtypes (biotypes). We applied our model to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset comprising 3,508 children aged 9-11 years and revealed two reproducible brain-behavior dimensions that captured variation in cognitive control and emotion-attention regulation. These dimensions further yielded three distinct biotypes, each exhibiting unique symptom profiles and distinct brain development. We tested the robustness and generalizability of the dimensions and corresponding biotypes in an independent cohort of 224 age-matched participants from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and documented their early expression before symptom onset during adolescence. These findings highlight the utility of brain-behavior dimensions for elucidating heterogeneous psychiatric presentations and advance a biologically grounded framework for early classification and potential clinical translation in youth mental health.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

      "title": "Statistical characterization of cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics evoked by cortical stimulation in mice",
      "content": "Objective. Statistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Approach. Our method applies mixture models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus time histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain. Main results. The characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The random forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification. Significance. This study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Our approach achieves high accuracy in stimulus decoding and brain region classification, providing valuable contributions for neuroscience research and neuro-technology applications.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
