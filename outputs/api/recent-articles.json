      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Risk of postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with spontaneous intracranial hematoma stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

Due to the rarity of these cases, there is no consensus on acute management.

Conservative measures, including mydriatics and compression, failed to control...",
