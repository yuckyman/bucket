      "title": "Self-organized Recovery of Coordinated Locomotion in Crickets Revealed by Prosthetic Limb Integration",
      "content": "Distributed sensorimotor interactions facilitate the coordination of multilegged locomotion in insects without centralized control, yet the mechanisms that allow coordinated locomotion to re-emerge following limb loss remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the effects of leg amputation and the integration of prosthetic legs on walking coordination in crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Spherical treadmill experiments revealed that leg amputation disrupts inter-leg phase coupling, decreases locomotor speed, and alters spatial foot placement in a state-dependent manner, indicating impaired load-mediated coordination. Prosthetic legs did not merely restore intact kinematics; instead, they selectively reinstated coherent temporal coordination and axis-specific spatial organization. This structured recovery illustrates that re-introducing mechanically relevant sensory constraints is sufficient to re-engage distributed coordination networks, even in the absence of anatomical integrity. Our findings elucidate an embodied principle through which sensory-mechanical feedback facilitates the self-organization of resilient multi-legged locomotion in the context of morphological interventions.",

      "title": "Microstate-specific functional connectivity in alcohol use disorder using resting-state EEG",
      "content": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is often described as a \"disconnection syndrome\", reflecting neural dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. However, previous studies on functional connectivity of resting-state EEG (rsEEG) in AUD have reported inconsistent findings -- some showing hyperconnectivity, others hypoconnectivity or no significant differences -- possibly due to overlooking the brain's dynamic nature even at its resting state. Here, we examined rsEEG in 26 young adults with AUD and 35 healthy controls (HC), using microstate analysis to characterize transient brain states and to estimate functional connectivity within each state. We showed that microstate map topologies were comparable between the two groups. However, the temporal dynamics in the AUD group were biased toward microstates C and D, characterized by anterior-to-posterior configurations, within which between-channel functional connectivity differed from that of HC. Particularly within microstate C, the AUD group showed significantly reduced functional connectivity compared to the HC group in the majority of channel pairs. Moreover, compared with conventional functional connectivity estimates, microstate-specific functional connectivity yielded superior classification performance in distinguishing individuals with AUD from HC. Subsequent computation of graph-theoretical measures revealed that individuals with AUD showed less stable hub-like properties and reduced small-worldness in microstate C, indicating diminished network efficiency. Our findings suggest that transient EEG properties, exemplified by microstate-specific functional connectivity, provide informative neural markers for characterizing the impact of alcohol use on the brain.",

      "title": "Vocal production differentially affects fast- and broad-spiking neurons in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Vocalization, foundational for information exchange in animals, is supported by vocalization-modulated neurons that occur across species and brain areas. These neurons are typically studied in an undifferentiated manner, despite the heterogeneous nature of the cortical circuitry regarding cell types. Overlooking this diversity risks producing incomplete models of cortical function. Here, we address this challenge by studying large-scale, cell-type specific auditory cortical activity during vocalization in the bat Carollia perspicillata, a vocal specialist. We discovered that vocalisation-related modulatory effects in the auditory cortex, a critical attribute of the underlying circuit, differ starkly between putative inhibitory and pyramidal neurons. During calling, novel cell assemblies and temporal spiking patterns emerge wherein inhibitory cells play a pivotal role. Further, vocalization-specific neural decorrelations affect inhibitory cells most strongly. Together, these results demonstrate that vocalization-related neuronal activity is cell-type specific at the single- and multi-cellular levels of cortical organisation and highlight the importance of inhibitory neurons for auditory cortical dynamics during vocal production.",

      "title": "Causal Evidence for Left DLPFC Contributions to Working Memory, Attention, and Cognitive Control in Ageing: A cTBS/ERP Study",
      "content": "Ageing is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and marked declines in working memory (WM), a domain critically dependent on the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although non-invasive brain stimulation is widely used to target this region, the causal contribution of the DLPFC to WM performance in older adults remains insufficiently understood. Here, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to transiently inhibit the left DLPFC in twenty healthy older adults and assessed the behavioural and neurophysiological consequences during verbal and visuospatial N-back tasks. Behaviourally, moderate learning effects emerged exclusively in the verbal task following vertex stimulation, whereas learning after DLPFC stimulation remained inconclusive. Performance in the visuospatial task showed no reliable evidence of learning across conditions, consistent with greater interindividual variability and age-related decline in spatial WM. Neurophysiologically, ERP amplitudes were stable across conditions; however, marked latency perturbations were observed. In the verbal task, P200 and N200 latencies robustly predicted performance, with P200 latency significantly prolonged after DLPFC inhibition, indicating disrupted early attentional gating. N200 and P300 latency modulations further suggested load-dependent compensatory strategies, reflecting adaptive slowing of cognitive control processes. In contrast, visuospatial performance was not reliably predicted by P200 latency, although N200 and P300 latencies remained informative, indicating domain-specific differences in DLPFC involvement. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence that left DLPFC disruption selectively interferes with the temporal coordination of verbal WM, emphasising the central role of processing speed and compensatory dynamics in cognitive ageing. ERP latency markers emerge as sensitive indices of subtle stimulation-induced perturbations in older adults.",

      "title": "Transmembrane PhoxID: Photo-proximity labelling across the plasma membrane",
      "content": "Transmembrane proteins perform essential roles in cellular transport, signalling, and communication. The function and dynamics of these proteins are precisely regulated by interactions on both sides of the plasma membrane; thus, mapping the composition of these interactomes is a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Proximity labelling methods are powerful tools for this purpose; however, existing approaches that rely on membrane-impermeable reactive species are limited by the ability to detect only one side, either the extracellular or the intracellular region, of transmembrane proteins. Here, we capitalized on the cell permeability of singlet oxygen to carry out proximity labelling of the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane proteins using an extracellularly anchored photosensitizer. We applied this method, termed transmembrane PhoxID (tmPhoxID), to several receptors (GRID2, GABAAR, and GRM1) in the living mouse brain and successfully determined their specific intracellular interactomes. Notably, network analysis of the identified proteins revealed that this method can characterize the native components of transsynaptic nanocolumns formed at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses. Furthermore, our study revealed a previously uncharacterized GABAAR-CAMKV interaction in mice and human brains. Our results provide a proof of concept for transmembrane and transcellular proximity labelling, providing a powerful platform for analysing the interactome of transmembrane proteins.",

      "title": "Synaptic vesicle undocking induces low frequency depression",
      "content": "Synaptic depression is often interpreted as reflecting depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) following exocytosis. Such a mechanism predicts little or no depression at low stimulation frequency, as RRP replenishment should then offset the loss of vesicles by exocytosis. Nevertheless, in several types of mammalian central synapses, repetitive presynaptic stimulation at low frequency (< 5 Hz) elicits synaptic depression (low frequency depression, or LFD). In the present work we count the number of synaptic vesicles released at individual active zones to study the RRP and its replenishment during LFD. Contrary to depletion models of synaptic depression, we find that LFD does not depend on previous SV consumption. We find that LFD displays a long recovery time course (tens of seconds) when challenged by isolated stimulations but is immediately reversed by a high frequency train. We suggest that LFD results from undocking, a shift between two classes of synaptic vesicles organized sequentially inside the RRP (replacement vs. docked vesicles) in favor of the upstream (replacement) state. While undocking is apparent hundreds of milliseconds after a stimulation, calcium dependent docking takes only a couple of milliseconds, explaining the fast LFD recovery when stimulating at high frequency. Consistent with the undocking model, we find that double presynaptic stimulations alleviate LFD as they favor vesicular docking and RRP replenishment. Finally, we expand our model to explain how stimulation frequency shapes short-term synaptic depression, changing from depression at low frequency to a facilitation-depression sequence at medium or high frequency trains.",

Your root agent can bring in other agents as needed, and we create a typesafe way for you to define the interfaces between those agents. We call these decks.<p>Agents can call agents, and each agent can be designed with whatever model params make sense for your task.<p>Additionally, each step of the chain gets automatic evals, we call graders. A grader is another deck type\u2026 but it\u2019s designed to evaluate and score conversations (or individual conversation turns).<p>We also have test agents you can define on a deck-by-deck basis, that are designed to mimic scenarios your agent would face and generate synthetic data for either humans or graders to grade.<p>Prior to Gambit, we had built an LLM based video editor, and we weren\u2019t happy with the results, which is what brought us down this path of improving inference time LLM quality.<p>We know it\u2019s missing some obvious parts, but we wanted to get this out there to see how it could help people or start conversations. We\u2019re really happy with how it\u2019s working with some of our early design partners, and we think it\u2019s a way to implement a lot of interesting applications:<p>- Truly open source agents and assistants, where logic, code, and prompts can be easily shared with the community.<p>- Rubric based grading to guarantee you (for instance) don\u2019t leak PII accidentally<p>- Spin up a usable bot in minutes and have Codex or Claude Code use our command line runner / graders to build a first version that is pretty good w/ very little human intervention.<p>We\u2019ll be around if ya\u2019ll have any questions or thoughts.

      "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",
