      "title": "Rendering Affective Touch With an Array of Pneumatic Unit Cell Actuators",
      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

      "title": "Monolingual, Non-tone Bilingual, and Tone Bilingual Infants: Language Experiences Alter Speech and Nonspeech Perception",
      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "content": "Early neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease emerge before cognitive decline, yet their synaptic basis remains poorly defined. Here we identify an early, cell-type-specific disruption of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens during pre-plaque stages of disease. In APP/PS1 mice, intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation is associated with a selective loss of mGluR1/5-dependent long-term depression in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, despite comparable intracellular amyloid-beta levels across neuronal subtypes. This impairment is accompanied by aberrant postsynaptic remodeling characterized by functional accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and increased excitatory drive. These synaptic alterations coincide with reduced dopamine-dependent signaling and selective changes in reward-related behavior, including altered hedonic consumption. Together, these findings identify an early vulnerability of the mesolimbic reward system and suggest that non-cognitive manifestations of Alzheimer's disease arise from circuit-level imbalance before plaque deposition.",

      "title": "Eye movements reveal the intuitive understanding of materials and their behavior",
      "content": "Does a metal ball sink or float when dropped into water? Answering this intuitively simple question relies on our understanding of materials and their physics. Knowing materials helps us to recognize objects, estimate their properties, and predict how they will behave when interacting with other objects or materials. This leads to expectations about material behaviors already in young infants, for example, that a metal ball should sink in water. Typically, properties and affordances of materials have been studied with perceptual tasks. But even though explicit perceptual judgments allow us to identify important determinants of material understanding, it is not clear how they relate to dynamic predictions of material behavior - which we need for successful interactions with objects. Here, we tap into material understanding by leveraging anticipatory eye movements, which have been shown to be direct readouts of trajectory predictions and can also reflect expectations about material properties such as elasticity or mass. This allows us to reveal the temporal evolution of dynamic predictions based on material properties. Furthermore, by using novel stimuli that violate intuitive expectations about material behavior, we demonstrate that even though dynamic predictions can be learned over time, there remains a fundamental difference between predictions in line with and against our intuitive expectations.",

      "title": "Ventral pallidal perineuronal nets regulate opioid relapse",
      "content": "Opioid use disorder remains a major health challenge worldwide. Neuronal activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) regulates opioid reward and relapse to opioid seeking but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. A sizable population of VP neurons previously linked to drug relapse expresses the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (VPPV). Across the brain parvalbumin neurons are often ensheathed by perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular structures that regulate intrinsic activity and constrain synaptic plasticity onto these neurons. The VP contains high levels of PNNs but the role of these structures in the neurophysiology of VPPV neurons and in relapse to opioid seeking has not been studied. To investigate whether VP PNNs are altered by opioid exposure, male and female mice were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin. We found that heroin increased the density of PNNs in the VP, and that an intracranial microinfusion of the PNN-degrading enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, prevented cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. VP PNN depletion also reduced the intrinsic excitability of VPPV neurons, potentiated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto these cells, and diminished Fos expression in VPPV neurons following reinstatement. The suppressive effect of VP PNN depletion on heroin seeking was rescued by chemogenetic activation of VPPV neurons and mimicked by chemogenetic VPPV neuron inhibition. Taken together, our results identify VPPV neurons and their associated PNNs as critical drivers of opioid seeking. Given the key role of PNNs in regulating neural plasticity and memory processes, targeting PNNs in the VP could provide a useful novel therapeutic avenue for treating persistent craving and relapse in opioid use disorder.",

      "title": "Reinforced Hippocampus-Accumbens pathway marks a shift towards cognitive decline in aging",
      "content": "Aging triggers early functional alterations in brain circuits that precede cognitive impairment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Spatial navigation and memory, among the earliest affected, depend on hippocampus and downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which integrates spatial and motivational information to guide goal directed behaviors. Here we identify age-related, sex-dependent changes of the dorsal hippocampus - NAc (dHPC - NAc) pathway. Combining optogenetics with electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and behavioral analyses in mice, we show that aging shifts excitation - inhibition balance in dorsal CA1 toward pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability, strengthening hippocampal outputs. This selectively enhances synaptic drive onto D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons and involves a previously unrecognized long-range parvalbumin-expressing glutamatergic projection. Reducing dHPC-NAc excitability improves memory in aged mice. In humans, fMRI reveals heightened posterior hippocampal activity and stronger pHPC-NAc coupling during navigation. Together, we uncover a targetable pathway acting in an intervention-sensitive window of aging to correct negative cognitive trajectories.",

      "content": "Haptic wearables provide an intuitive human-machine interface to convey information through the sense of touch, which may have promising applications in guided breathing. In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
      "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

      "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
      "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

      "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",
