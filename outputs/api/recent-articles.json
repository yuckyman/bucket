      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

      "content": "Touch plays a key role in our perception of our body and shapes our interactions with the world, from the objects we manipulate to the people we touch. While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",

The data set is uniquely curated, combining ground-truth data from Kaggle and real-world samples collected from blind schools, segmented into vowels and consonants. The proposed system demonstrates exceptional performance in feature extraction, classification accuracy, and addressing spatial misalignments in...",

      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",
