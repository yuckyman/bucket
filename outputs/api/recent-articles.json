      "title": "Neural basis of intensity-dependent brain activity in response to mechanical stimulation and the level of pain sensitivity",
      "content": "IntroductionPain perception greatly varies among individuals and represents a major clinical challenge. Current pain assessment relies on subjective reports; although straightforward, these cannot distinguish the diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of pain. Elucidating brain functional mechanisms using fMRI is crucial for realizing more objective pain assessment. Most studies have focused on thermal stimuli or psychological evaluations, and no studies have focused on differences in sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify regional differences in brain activation during mechanical stimulation at different intensities using fMRI and to clarify brain activation patterns associated with differences in pain sensitivity between the low- and high-threshold groups.MethodsWe enrolled 52 healthy adults. After measuring mechanical tactile and pain thresholds, fMRI was performed during mechanical stimulation at three intensities (60, 100, and 180\u202fg). Regions of brain activation were identified for each stimulus intensity in all participants and for the high- and low-threshold groups, using the 100-g stimulus as the cutoff value, based on mechanical pain thresholds.ResultsNotable results regarding the change in stimulus intensity are that significant activation was observed in the anterior insular cortex at 60\u202fg; anterior insular cortex, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum at 100\u202fg; and cerebellum, angular gyrus, and thalamus at 180\u202fg of stimulus intensity. Notable results regarding the level of pain sensitivity are that, when classified into the low- (n\u202f=\u202f24) and high-threshold (n\u202f=\u202f28) groups, activation in the low-threshold group was limited to the somatosensory cortex and its related regions. However, the high-threshold group exhibited activation in the anterior insular cortex, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, in addition to the somatosensory cortex.ConclusionThe expansion of brain activation with increasing stimulus intensity suggests the involvement of higher-order central processing, such as attention and response preparation, in noxious stimulus processing. Additionally, differences in pain thresholds may reflect variations in the mode of neural response; the high-threshold group exhibited activation in the frontoparietal network, associated with cognitive control. These findings provide a neurobiological basis for psychological interventions and may serve as a foundation for developing objective biomarkers and advancing personalized pain treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Depression mediates motor dysfunction\u2019s effect on sleep quality in ALS: a mediation analysis study",
      "content": "IntroductionPoor sleep quality affects 50\u201363% of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, exacerbating disease burden and reducing quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among disease severity, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality in ALS, with a focus on the mediating effects of depression.MethodsOur study enrolled 408 ALS patients. Disease severity was assessed using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), sleep quality via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and psychological status using the Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) scales. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlations, multivariate regression, and mediation analysis (Hayes\u2019 PROCESS macro).ResultsPoor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) was observed in 54.4% of patients. Multivariate analysis found ALSFRS-R (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.135, p\u202f=\u202f0.042) and HAMD (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.270, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) correlated with sleep quality. Initial mediation analysis using the full ALSFRS-R and PSQI scales was not significant. Aimed to further explore the correlation, we derived specific subscales ALSFRS-R\u2019 (motor/respiratory components) and PSQI\u2019 (sleep efficiency/ daytime dysfunction), which more correlated with each other. Mediation analysis of these subscales revealed that depressive symptoms accounted for 36.3% of the indirect effect between ALSFRS-R\u2019 and PSQI\u2019.DiscussionOur cross-sectional exploratory study suggests that depression may partly mediate the relationship between motor dysfunction and poor sleep quality in patients with ALS. Although our mediation analysis suggested a potential association, further longitudinal cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings. The potential mediating role of depression underscores the need for an integrated clinical management approach addressing not only motor symptoms but psychological well-being as well.",

      "title": "Insomnia treatment based on the regulation of the GABAergic system: traditional Chinese medicine perspectives and therapeutic approaches",
      "content": "Insomnia is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction that may be attributable to the involvement of abnormalities in multiple systems. Dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system is one of the key pathologic factors responsible for the increased neural excitability. GABA has been regarded as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, which can maintain the dynamic balance of neural networks by regulating neuronal excitability. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its multi-component, multi-target therapeutic advantages, shows unique potential in regulating the GABAergic system to improve sleep disorders. Accordingly, this review systematically elucidated the underlying mechanisms of TCM in treating insomnia by regulating the GABAergic system. According to the results, the intervention pathways of TCM exhibited multidimensional characteristics. TCM could effectively enhance GABA levels, strengthen GABAergic neural signal transmission, and improve insomnia symptoms by activating GABA receptor expression, upregulating glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression, and inhibiting GABA transaminase (GABA-T) activity. Furthermore, TCM could regulate the function of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, inhibit neuroinflammation, regulate circadian rhythms, and enhance neurotrophic mechanisms, thereby synergizing with the GABAergic system to exert a sedative and sleep-promoting effect. With a systematic elaboration of the mechanisms of the GABAergic system, findings in this study may provide a theoretical basis for establishing a TCM evaluation system for insomnia based on the modulation of the GABAergic system. It can also offer fresh insights into the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia from the perspective of TCM, expand new directions for clinical research, and supply potential reference for future in-depth studies.",

Antioxidant activity used DPPH assay; biocompatibility involved MTT and hemolysis assays. Efficacy was tested in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, assessing motor function, antioxidant capacity, and dopaminergic neuron protection.ResultsIONPs exhibited spherical morphology (39.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.3 nm), zeta potential of \u221213\u202fmV, and saturation magnetization of 42.32 emu/g. They showed concentration-dependent DPPH scavenging and no significant cytotoxicity or hemolysis up to 10 \u00b5g/mL. In vitro, IONPs improved motor performance, boosted antioxidants, and reduced apoptosis in dopamine neurons.ConclusionBiosynthesized IONPs offer promise as a complementary PD therapy by mitigating motor deficits and neurochemical damage.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging evidence of acupuncture in cognitive impairment following ischemic stroke: a systematic review",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis review aimed to summarize neuroimaging evidence on the effects of acupuncture in post-ischemic stroke cognitive impairment (PISCI) and to explore its potential neural mechanisms.MethodsA systematic search was conducted across multiple databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), SinoMed (China Biology Medicine Disc), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Data, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed for all eligible studies.ResultsEight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the effects of acupuncture on brain activity and metabolic changes. The neuroimaging findings showed that all studies focused on the sustained effects of acupuncture on brain functional activity.ConclusionsThis review provides preliminary neuroimaging evidence supporting the potential benefits of acupuncture for PISCI. The findings suggest that the possible mechanisms of acupuncture for PISCI involve changes in the activity and enhanced functional connectivity of cognition-related brain regions. Additionally, acupuncture may influence brain networks and regulate neurochemical metabolites within cognition-related regions. However, as this field remains in its early stages, further validation is needed. Future studies should focus on well-designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes and incorporate multiple neuroimaging techniques to better clarify and verify the neural mechanisms of acupuncture in PISCI.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO, identifier: CRD420250652194.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "A Framework for Optimizing Human-Machine Interaction in Classification Systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05974v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated decision systems increasingly rely on human oversight to ensure accuracy in uncertain cases. This paper presents a practical framework for optimizing such human-in-the-loop classification systems using a double-threshold policy. Instead of relying on a single decision cutoff, the system defines two thresholds (a lower and an upper) to automatically accept or reject confident cases while routing ambiguous ones for human review. We formalize this problem as an optimization task that balances system accuracy against human review workload and demonstrate its behavior through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results quantify how different probability score distributions affect the efficiency of human intervention and identify the regions of diminishing returns where additional review yields minimal benefit. The framework provides a general, reproducible method for improving reliability in any decision pipeline requiring selective human validation, including applications in entity resolution, fraud detection, medical triage, and content moderation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05871v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interviews are commonplace in HCI. This paper presents a novel documentary method of interpretation that supports analysis of the topics contained within a collection of transcripts, topics that are endogenous to it and which elaborate participants collective reasoning about issues of relevance to research. We contrast endogenous topic analysis with established qualitative approaches, including content analysis, grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis, and thematic analysis, to draw out the distinctive character of the documentary method of interpretation. Unlike established methods, the DMI does not require that the analyst be proficient in qualitative analysis, or have sound knowledge of underlying theories and methods. The DMI is a members method, not a social science method, that relies on mastery of natural language; a competence most people possess.",

      "title": "Decoding Workload and Agreement From EEG During Spoken Dialogue With Conversational AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.",

      "title": "Improving Clinical Data Accessibility Through Automated FHIR Data Transformation Tools",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard has emerged as a widely adopted specification for exchanging structured clinical data across healthcare systems. However, raw FHIR resources are often complex, verbose, and difficult for clinicians and analysts to interpret without specialized tooling. This paper presents a lightweight, browser-based system that improves the accessibility of FHIR data by automatically transforming raw JSON resources into human-readable PDF and Excel reports, along with interactive data visualizations. The system supports both remote retrieval of FHIR resources from server endpoints and the upload of local FHIR JSON files, enabling both online and offline analysis. Using a modular React architecture with jsPDF, xlsx, and Recharts, the tool parses, normalizes, visualizes, and exports FHIR data in an intuitive format. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system enhances interpretability and usability while preserving the semantic integrity of FHIR structures. Limitations and future extensions, including expanded FHIR profile support and clinical validation, are discussed.",

      "title": "SAFE: Secure and Accurate Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05789v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.",
