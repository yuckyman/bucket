      "title": "The interaction between aging and DNA damage influences the accumulation of APP in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "DNA damage is a major driver of the aging process. The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worsens the situation as evidenced by the finding that the neurons of the AD brain have elevated levels of DNA damage. AD is also associated with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) known for its proteolytic peptide fragment, A{beta}. In the current work we find that these three elements - age, DNA damage, and APP - are associated with each other and present evidence in the mouse brain supporting the hypothesis that DNA damage is the likely cause of the increased APP levels. Using the TUNEL reaction to track DNA damage, we show that the TUNEL staining increases significantly with age (6 months to 24 months). Next, we used immunostaining of intracellular APP to show that it too increases over this same time period. To separate correlation from causality we repeated these analyses using tissue from mice genetically deficient in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, an enzyme associated with part of the DNA damage repair mechanism. TUNEL signal in neurons of 6-month Atm-/- animals was equivalent to that seen in 24-month wild type. Significantly, the APP signal in the Atm-/- cells increased in consort and the relationship between DNA damage and APP was found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity associated with aging is a cellular stressor that increases the levels of APP and thus increases vulnerability to the pathogenesis of AD.",

      "title": "MiR-34a deficiency enhances nucleic acid sensing and type I IFN signaling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "MiR-34a is implicated in aging, cell senescence, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to investigate the role of miR-34a in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we produced an AD mouse model, Tg-SwDI mice, with whole body/constitutive miR-34a knockout (KO). MiR-34a KO improved long-term memory in Tg-SwDI mice, which was associated with decreases in the ratio of insoluble A{beta}42 to A{beta}40 and with increases in soluble and insoluble A{beta}40 in the cerebral cortex. Anti-Iba1 immunofluorescence revealed increases in activated microglia. Bulk RNA-sequencing of the hippocampus followed by a gene set enrichment analysis (Enrichr) identified '' cellular response to type I interferon '' and '' type I interferon signaling pathway'' as the most prominent gene sets in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice compared to miR-34a wild-type Tg-SwDI mice. Many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that characterize interferon responsive microglia (IRM) were upregulated in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice. MiR-34a knockdown strongly enhanced ISGs expression in TLR7 ligand-stimulated BV2 microglia. These results suggest that miR-34a inhibits the transition of microglia to the IRM state that may modulate synaptic and cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.",

      "title": "Interactions of the LINE-1 encoded ORF1p with proteins and chromatin converge on a role in neuronal physiology",
      "content": "Retrotransposons are emerging as novel regulators of embryonic and brain development. We recently demonstrated that the LINE-1 encoded protein ORF1p is abundantly expressed in adult mouse and human neurons, although its function remains unclear. Here, we characterize the ORF1p interactome in differentiated mouse and human neurons using mass spectrometry and identify novel partners implicated in gene regulation and neuron-specific processes. ORF1p localizes not only to neuronal nuclei, where it associates with chromatin under steady-state conditions, but also to neurites, supporting a role in neuronal physiology. To further explore its nuclear functions, we sorted human post-mortem neurons with high or low nuclear ORF1p levels and performed ORF1p knockdown in cultured human neurons, followed by chromatin accessibility assays. Both approaches revealed consistent patterns of differential chromatin accessibility dependent on ORF1p. Loss of ORF1p also led to the downregulation of long, neuron-specific genes and altered neurite morphology. Together, these findings point to a physiological role of ORF1p in post-mitotic neurons, mediated through converging interactions with proteins and chromatin.",

      "content": "<p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>",

      "title": "Stimulus Contingency and Task Context Encoding within the Anterior Cingulate-Amygdala-Cerebellum Associative Learning Network",
      "content": "<p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>",

      "title": "Optical Recordings of Unitary Synaptic Connections Reveal High and Random Local Connectivity between CA3 Pyramidal Cells",
      "content": "<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>",

      "title": "Asymmetries in Foveal Vision",
      "content": "<p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the  foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only  away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~ away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>",
