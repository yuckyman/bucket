      "title": "Pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte ADGRG1 is required for axon ensheathment and CNS myelin formation",
      "content": "Myelin is essential for axonal health and rapid propagation of action potentials. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelination is initiated with axon ensheathment by pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (preOLs), followed by iterative membrane wrapping and longitudinal extension along the axon. The molecular mechanisms that govern preOL development remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also called GPR56) as a key, evolutionarily conserved regulator of this process. We show that ADGRG1 is highly expressed in preOLs and that its conditional deletion in mouse preOLs leads to simplified preOL morphology and defective axon ensheathment, resulting in CNS hypomyelination. Live imaging in zebrafish demonstrated conserved function of Adgrg1 in axon ensheathment. Mechanistically, we show that ADGRG1 promotes preOL maturation by RhoA activation. Collectively, these findings reveal an ADGRG1-mediated RhoA signaling pathway that governs axon ensheathment and myelin formation.",

      "title": "Driving theta-gamma oscillations modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone: a tACS-TMS study",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupled ({theta}{gamma}-PAC) oscillations in primary motor cortex (M1) have been shown to support motor skill acquisition. Past research has shown that driving gamma activity at the theta peak (TGP), but not the theta trough (TGT) using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enhances motor learning (Akkad et al., 2021). However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phase-specific effect remain unclear. METHODS: In a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study, twenty-two healthy participants received 20 minutes of 75Hz/6Hz TGP-tACS, TGT-tACS, or sham stimulation over M1. We used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess GABAergic and NMDAR-mediated activity before, during, and after tACS. Outcome measures included short-interval intracortical inhibition at 1ms (SICI1ms; extrasynaptic GABAergic tone) and 2.5ms (SICI2.5ms; synaptic GABAA activity), intracortical facilitation at 12ms (ICF12ms; NMDAR activity), and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (corticospinal excitability). RESULTS: TGP-tACS selectively decreased SICI1ms, a putative marker of extrasynaptic GABAergic tone (main effect of Stimulation: p=.021), with significant differences between TGP and TGT during late stimulation (p=.047). No significant effects were observed on corticospinal excitability, synaptic GABAergic activity (SICI2.5ms), or NMDAR signalling (ICF12ms). CONCLUSIONS: Driving theta-gamma oscillations at the theta peak using tACS specifically modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone in M1 without affecting corticospinal excitability or synaptic inhibition. Given that reductions in GABAergic signalling supports motor learning, these findings provide a neurophysiological mechanism for the phase-specific behavioural effects of {theta}{gamma}-PAC tACS and suggest a potential therapeutic approach for facilitating motor recovery after stroke.",

      "title": "Parallel control of conjunctive and compositional representations supports dynamic task preparation",
      "content": "People can dynamically and adaptively update task goals in the face of task uncertainty. In this fMRI study, we aimed to investigate the modulation of neural task representations that subserve such flexible task control. On each trial, we asked people to perform one of nine image categorization tasks. During task preparation, participants had to actively infer varying levels of task uncertainty and dynamically modulate their task preparation accordingly. Multivariate pattern analyses demonstrated dissociable uncertainty-driven modulations of conjunctive and compositional task representations in the right frontoparietal network. Specifically, different sub-regions showed diminished conjunctive task representations when task uncertainty increased during task preparation. At the same time, we observed an active maintenance of compositional task representations, suggesting an adaptive cognitive strategy in facilitating compositional task reconfiguration. These findings suggest a mechanism of parallel control on conjunctive and compositional representations that allows for maximizing the advantages of both representational formats, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning human flexible task preparation.",

      "title": "Functional recruitment of astrocyte-derived neurons into the mouse visual cortex",
      "content": "Inducing neurogenesis from glia could permit circuit remodeling and neuron replacement in the brain. Indirect evidence suggests that glia-to-neuron reprogramming is feasible, but the dynamics of conversion have not been directly observed, and it remains unclear whether glia-derived cortical neurons can functionally integrate into brain circuits. Here, we use two-photon imaging to visualize the reprogramming of astroglia into induced neurons in the mouse cortex in vivo. We track the emergence of spontaneous neuron-like calcium transients in astrocyte-derived induced neurons, demonstrating their functional activity in vivo. Importantly, these induced neurons exhibit orientation tuned, visually evoked calcium responses, demonstrating their functional integration into cortical circuitry - a prerequisite for their utility in circuit repair. Thus, astrocytes can be recruited to generate functional neurons in the postnatal cortex, enabling circuit remodeling in perinatal injury or neurodevelopmental disorders without relying on external cellular sources.",

      "title": "Astrocyte diversity and aging in the mouse lemur primate brain",
      "content": "Astrocytes play key roles in maintaining brain homeostasis, metabolism, and neurovascular integrity, yet their diversity and age-related modulation remain insufficiently understood, particularly across primate lineages. While rodent studies have generated extensive knowledge, notable species differences highlight the need for comparative analyses in non-human primates. The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small primate widely used in aging research, offers a valuable but underexplored model for studying astroglial aging. In this study, we characterized astrocyte distribution, morphology, and reactivity in 17 mouse lemurs aged 1.0 to 11.5 years using GFAP and vimentin immunohistochemistry. We identified marked regional and morphological heterogeneity, with dense astrocytic labeling in white matter, hippocampus, and sparse but diverse cortical populations. Distinct astrocyte subtypes (including fibrous, protoplasmic, projection, pial and subpial interlaminar, radial glia-like cells, tanycytes) were documented. Varicosity-bearing processes were common across multiple astroglial subtypes and may indicate altered physiological states. Quantitative analyses revealed pronounced age-related increases in astrocytic reactivity, particularly in white matter and interlaminar astrocytes. Cortical and hippocampal changes were comparatively modest. These findings indicate region-specific astrocytic vulnerability during aging and support the translational value of the mouse lemur for investigating glial aging in primates.",

      "title": "Chronic acoustic degradation via cochlear implants alters predictive processing of audiovisual speech",
      "content": "This study provides the first neurophysiological evidence of how cochlear implant (CI) input affects predictive processing during audiovisual language comprehension in deaf individuals. Using EEG, we compared 18 CI users with 18 normal-hearing (NH) controls during sentence comprehension where final word predictability was determined by high or low semantic constraint (HC vs. LC) of the preceding sentence frame. Between sentence frame and final word, a 800 ms silent gap was introduced. Mouth visibility was manipulated during sentence frames (visible or digitally occluded; V+ vs. V-), while the final words were always presented with the mouth visible. In NH participants, lower-beta power (12-15 Hz) in left frontal and central sensors decreased for HC vs. LC contexts during the pre-target silent gap, but only when the mouths was visible, suggesting active prediction generation. In CI users, this lower beta power decrease was absent. After final word presentation, both groups showed N400 predictability effects, indicating preserved prediction evaluation. However, CI users exhibited extended N400 effects in the V+ condition, suggesting additional processing demands. Across all participants, pre-target beta modulations correlated with language production abilities, supporting prediction-by-production frameworks. Within CI users, poorer audiometric thresholds correlated with larger N400 constraint effects, possibly indicating greater reliance on contextual prediction to compensate for degraded sensory input. These findings demonstrate that CI-mediated perception alters the neural mechanisms of prediction generation. The link between production skills and predictive mechanisms suggests that strengthening expressive language abilities may enhance predictive processing in CI users.",
