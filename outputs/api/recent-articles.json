      "title": "Beyond IVR Touch-Tones: Customer Intent Routing using LLMs",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21715v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Widespread frustration with rigid touch-tone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive language interaction. While speech technologies are necessary, the key challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to IVR menu paths, a task where Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential. Progress, however, is limited by data scarcity, as real IVR structures and interactions are often proprietary. We present a novel LLM-based methodology to address this gap. Using three distinct models, we synthesized a realistic 23-node IVR structure, generated 920 user intents (230 base and 690 augmented), and performed the routing task. We evaluate two prompt designs: descriptive hierarchical menus and flattened path representations, across both base and augmented datasets. Results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy, reaching 89.13% on the base dataset compared to 81.30% with the descriptive format, while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces performance. Confusion matrix analysis further suggests that low-performing routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu design. Overall, our findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that LLMs can enable IVR routing through a smoother, more seamless user experience -- moving customer service one step ahead of touch-tone menus.",

      "title": "Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.22039v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.22022v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and neurostimulation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21748v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from 80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38 participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands, producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus, particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively. fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (>=90% accuracy), with slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95% +/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network disorder requiring multimodal analysis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.23391v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields. Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering long-standing questions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.23321v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.22924v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural recording implants are a crucial tool for both neuroscience research and enabling new clinical applications. The power consumption of high channel count implants is dominated by the circuits used to amplify and digitize neural signals. Since circuit designers have pushed the efficiency of these circuits close to the theoretical physical limits, reducing power further requires system level optimization. Recent advances use a strategy called channel selection, in which less important channels are turned off to save power. We demonstrate resolution reconfiguration, in which the resolution of less important channels is scaled down to save power. Our approach leverages variable importance of each channel inside machine-learning-based decoders and we trial this methodology across three applications: seizure detection, gesture recognition, and force regression. With linear decoders, resolution reconfiguration saves 8.7x, 12.8x, and 23.0x power compared to a traditional recording array for each task respectively. It further saves 1.6x, 3.4x, and 5.2x power compared to channel selection. The results demonstrate the power benefits of resolution reconfigurable front-ends and their wide applicability to neural decoding problems.",

      "title": "Tuned for Creativity? Graph-Theoretical Mapping of Resting-State EEG Reveals Neural Signatures of Creativity",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.22364v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.22262v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a lateral ventricular brain-computer interface (LV-BCI) that deploys an expandable, flexible electrode into the lateral ventricle through a minimally invasive external ventricular drainage pathway. Inspired by the framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days. We further designed an \"action-memory T-maze\" task and developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats' turn decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term stable recordings and robust memory decision decoding from within the ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems neuroscience.",

      "title": "Limitations of Proprioceptive Working Memory",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21996v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recalling previously experienced movements is essential for a range of activities, including sports, music, and rehabilitation, yet little is known about the accuracy and decay of proprioceptive working memory. We examined how introducing a short-term memory component affected movement reproduction accuracy by comparing movement reproduction under two conditions: simultaneous reproduction (SimRep) and memorized reproduction (MemRep). In Experiment 1 (N = 191), participants felt a 5-s haptic trajectory with one hand and reproduced it with the other hand simultaneously or immediately after the template ended. Errors were greater in MemRep than SimRep (31.1 deg vs. 21.5 deg, p < 0.001). MemRep trajectories showed systematic temporal distortions: participants lagged fast movements and led slow ones (R = -0.32, p = 0.01), unlike the ~279 ms lag in SimRep. In Experiment 2 (N = 33), we varied template durations (2-8 s). Longer durations increased error for MemRep but not SimRep (p < 0.001). During MemRep, accuracy declined steadily, with replay-template correlations dropping from ~0.4 to ~0.1 over ~3 s, while SimRep correlations rose from ~0.25 to ~0.6. In ~10% of MemRep templates, participants moved in the wrong direction initially, especially for low-amplitude movements (p < 0.001). Templates with more than four movements showed element omission; after four movements had been reproduced participants ceased movement prematurely, affecting up to 40% of 8-s templates. These findings show that transferring proprioceptive experiences into working memory introduces systematic temporal and structural distortions. Accuracy decays within seconds, and memory span for movement trajectories was limited to four movements.",

We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.",

      "title": "INPP5D/SHIP1 is a dual regulator of endo-lysosome function and selective phagocytosis in human microglia",
      "content": "INPP5D, the gene encoding SHIP1, is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and plays a central role in regulating immune function. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.",

      "title": "Alternative splicing of synaptotagmin 7 regulates oligomerization and short-term synaptic plasticity",
      "content": "Synaptic plasticity is crucial for learning and memory. The presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 (syt7) regulates aspects of short-term plasticity (STP), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that alternative splicing of the syt7 juxtamembrane linker acts as a molecular switch at both biochemical and functional levels. The  and {beta} variants undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form condensates, while the {gamma} variant forms aggregates. Using iGluSnFR imaging, we found that when expressed at equal levels, these three isoforms also diverge regarding their abilities to regulate two key aspects of STP: paired-pulse facilitation and synaptic depression. Further, MINFLUX super resolution microscopy demonstrated that syt7 forms clusters in the active zone, well-positioned to directly control synaptic vesicle dynamics. Thus, alternative splicing might fine-tune STP by differentially impacting syt7 oligomerization.",

      "title": "Control of Synaptic Communication through Molecularly Engineered Bioluminescence Light Emission and Sensing",
      "content": "Synapses are sites of intercellular communication between neurons and from neurons to target organs, and of signal integration that underly physiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a modular platform, Interluminescence (Int), for experimental control of synaptic transmission: bioluminescent light, generated by a luciferase oxidizing a luciferin, from a presynaptic neuron is used to activate transsynaptic optogenetic ion channels in the postsynaptic neuron. Two strategies can activate or silence postsynaptic neurons in vivo in the presence of luciferin. In the Act-Int approach, a luciferase is genetically expressed in synaptic vesicles and released during depolarization-induced presynaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis. In the Persist-Int approach, a luciferase is tethered to the presynaptic membrane where it can support sustained transsynaptic signaling. Both strategies can activate postsynaptic neurons with similar efficacy. By design, the modularity of the platform permits the use of luciferases and opsins ranging in brightness and light sensitivity, and the luciferase can be targeted to different subcellular regions of the presynaptic neuron. Our results demonstrate the utility and versatility of Interluminescence to mediate synapse-specific transmission that is either activity-dependent or activity-independent.",
