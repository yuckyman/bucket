      "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

      "title": "Impact of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Event-related Potentials during a Response Inhibition Task",
      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "content": "Threat displays are a common form of social communication. In flying species, such displays often involve stereotypical, choreographed wing and leg movements. How the brain coordinates characteristic movements of these appendages to transmit social signals is poorly understood. In male Drosophila, threat displays flexibly combine wing displays with rapid turns and charges. Here we identify two brain modules downstream of a superordinate threat command center. Each contains two neurons that combinatorially generate threat-specific appendicular movements: one comprises two descending neurons synergistically controlling wing threat; the other contains two interneurons that antagonistically control turns and charges. Within-module neuronal coactivation evokes appendage-specific actions recapitulating those evoked by the upstream center. These data uncover a hierarchical combinatorial circuit that coordinates wing and leg movements during a terrestrial social display. More generally, our findings identify an instantiation of a Tinbergenian hierarchical behavioral control system for social communication and reveal a novel underlying implementation logic.",

      "content": "Predicting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is essential for early central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery, yet reliable computational screening remains challenging. This study presents a gradient-boosted ensemble framework trained on precomputed molecular fingerprints to classify compounds as BBB-permeable (BBB+) or non-permeable (BBB-). The 2048-bit fingerprints encode substructural information relevant to passive diffusion without requiring explicit physicochemical descriptors. The model, trained on experimentally annotated BBB datasets using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, achieved strong predictive performance (cross-validated ROC-AUC = 0.897 +/- 0.019; validation ROC-AUC = 0.932). External testing on literature-reported CNS-active compounds (Caffeine, Diazepam, Dopamine, and Levodopa) confirmed biological consistency: highly lipophilic drugs were predicted as BBB+, while polar molecules dependent on carrier-mediated transport were predicted as BBB-. The fingerprint-based model thus captures underlying permeability mechanisms through data-driven substructure learning. This approach eliminates the need for handcrafted descriptors while preserving interpretability through feature-importance analysis, establishing a reproducible, efficient, and explainable baseline for virtual BBB permeability screening in CNS drug development.",

      "title": "PEX11\u03b2-mediated improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction restores behavioral defect and cellular viability in neuropathological conditions",
      "content": "Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 beta (Pex11{beta}) is a key regulator of peroxisome proliferation, functioning in coordination with mitochondrial fission proteins. Recent human proteome co-regulation mapping has revealed a distinctive co-expression pattern between Pex11{beta} and components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex at the peroxisome-mitochondria interface. In neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mitochondrial dysfunction is primarily associated with impairments in the respiratory chain complexes, particularly Complex II. However, the role of Pex11{beta} in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in these two disease conditions remains largely unexplored. In this study, using both in vitro and in vivo models, we identify Pex11{beta} as a critical modulator of mitochondrial dynamics, influencing the balance between fission and fusion. Through targeted knockdown and overexpression experiments, we demonstrate a direct link between Pex11{beta} level and mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated by transcriptional dysregulation of nuclear-encoded Complex II and mitochondrial fusion genes. Restoration of Pex11{beta} expression, along with Complex II and fusion gene level in striatal brain via a peroxisome proliferator and chemical chaperone, significantly alleviates motor and cognitive deficits in 3-NP-induced HD mouse model indicating better mitochondrial health in striatal brain. Furthermore, in silico analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a critical transcription factor governing the co -expression of Pex11{beta} and Complex II genes. This establishes a novel transcriptional axis that orchestrates inter organellar communication. Collectively, our findings position Pex11{beta} as a pivotal mediator of mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics, linking mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to behavioural outcomes, and offering mechanistic insights relevant to amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Path integration is essential for spatial navigation. Experimental studies have identified neural correlates for path integration, but exactly how the neural system accomplishes this computation remains unresolved. Here, we adopt recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to perform a path integration task to explore this issue. After training, we borrow neuroscience prior knowledge and methods to unfold the black box of the trained model, including: clarifying neuron types based on their receptive fields, dissecting information flows between neuron groups by pruning their connections, and analyzing internal dynamics of neuron groups using the attractor framework. Intriguingly, we uncover a hierarchical information processing pathway embedded in the RNN model, along which velocity information of an agent is first forwarded to band cells, band and grid cells then coordinate to carry out path integration, and finally grid cells output the agent location. Inspired by the RNN-based study, we construct a neural circuit model, in which band cells form one-dimensional (1D) continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) and serve as upstream neurons to support downstream grid cells to carry out path integration in the 2D space. Our study challenges the conventional view of considering grid cells as the principal velocity integrator, and supports a neural circuit model with the hierarchy of band and grid cells.",

      "title": "Differential encoding of noxious heat and self-reported pain along corticospinal networks: a simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI study",
      "content": "Chronic pain poses a substantial public health burden. Elucidating how the healthy central nervous system (CNS) differentially encodes objective stimulus intensity and subjective experiences of pain perception may offer key insights into the central mechanisms contributing to chronic pain. Functional MRI (fMRI) combined with controlled noxious stimulation provides a powerful means to explore neural representations of nociception and pain perception. Here, we applied noxious heat at three intensities (46 {degrees}C, 47 {degrees}C, 48 {degrees}C, 8 trials each randomized) to the right forearm of 28 healthy women during simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI to investigate how distributed corticospinal activity and connectivity encode stimulus intensity and subjective pain. Activity increased with stimulus temperature across regions involved in pain processing--including somatosensory, motor, prefrontal, insular, and subcortical areas--as well as in the ipsilateral dorsal and ventral spinal cord. Spinal-brain functional connectivity was observed between the right dorsal horn and pain-related brain regions such as primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and was positively associated with individual pain ratings. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that multivoxel activation patterns in the brain and spinal cord, as well as corticospinal connectivity patterns, reliably tracked stimulus temperature, while only subsets of cortical regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices) encoded subjective pain. Notably, spinal cord representations were primarily organized by stimulus temperature rather than perceived pain intensity. These findings demonstrate that simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI combined with multivariate modeling can identify sensory and perceptual components of nociceptive processing across the neuroaxis. Such approaches advance mechanistic understanding of pain and may inform the development of CNS-based biomarkers for chronic pain assessment and intervention.",

      "title": "BGTransform: a neurophysiologically informed EEG data augmentation framework",
      "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

      "title": "Using economic value signals from primate prefrontal cortex in neuro-engineering applications",
      "content": "Objective. Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) research has shown the efficacy of using motor and sensory-related neural signals to assist physically impaired patients. Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

      "title": "Inter-ictal spike rates are not modulated by anti-seizure medication taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit: a tale of two confounders *",
      "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

      "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
      "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",
