      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "title": "Lexical and Information Structure Functions of Prosody and Their Relevance for Spoken Communication: Evidence from Psychometric and Electroencephalographic Data",
      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Menstrual cycle phase alters corticospinal excitability and spike-timing-dependent plasticity in healthy females",
      "content": "The known fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations across the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle contribute to modulations in cortical excitability and inhibition. However, how such changes affect spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has not been systematically studied. This research aimed to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on corticospinal excitability and STDP. Twelve eumenorrheic female participants (age: 25 {+/-} 5 years), visited the lab in three menstrual cycle phases: early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and mid-luteal (ML). Visits comprised of corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential [MEP]/Mmax), short-intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) measures, recorded in the resting first dorsal interosseous. Followed by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, utilising ulnar nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (25 ms interstimulus interval) to elicit neuroplasticity. To assess the time course of STDP, measurements were repeated at 15 and 30-minutes post PAS. Corticospinal excitability (MEP/Mmax) was greater in the LF phase (p [&le;]0.002) compared to EF and ML, with no phase effects observed for SICI or ICF (p[&ge;]0.112). PAS elicited an increase in MEP/Mmax across all phases at 15-minutes (112 {+/-} 5, 115 {+/-} 5, and 113 {+/-} 7% baseline, p[&le;]0.010), whereas at 30-minutes only ML was facilitated (126 {+/-} 7% baseline, p=0.029). The present data demonstrates facilitatory STDP can be induced with PAS across the tested menstrual cycle phases, but responses are prolonged and potentiated in the ML phase. Additionally, increased corticospinal excitability in the LF phase is likely due to intrinsic changes within the descending tract, as no changes in intracortical neurotransmission were observed.",

      "title": "Exploring Single-Cell Gene Regulatory Dynamics in Rett Syndrome",
      "content": "Rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder with an incidence of 95% in women, characterized by the complexity of studying the associated phenotype due to the heterogeneity in patient tissues from the stochastic silencing of the affected X chromosome. Furthermore, we are largely unaware of the cascade of alterations that occur in neurons due to transcriptional changes induced by the affected MECP2 gene. To address these challenges, an in-depth network analysis was implemented using organoid single-cell transcriptomic data derived from human patients. We performed a Weighted correlation network analysis and trajectory analysis to understand the differences in the developmental processes between samples, we followed by the generation of gene regulatory networks for each relevant cell developmental pathways to assess the master regulator that are involved in this process with potential therapeutic implications which we identified by integration with SFARI and Genes4Epi. The results were adapted into dynamic Boolean models from fitted with the transcriptomic data for validation in which we evaluated the attractor field from each reachable state . These approaches allowed us to explore differences in regulatory behavior in the developmental pathways. Our study provides an insight that pinpoints the cellular stages on which the regulation and compensatory mechanism activate and regulate Rett syndrome. We identified 19 Master regulators for the Dopaminergic developmental trajectory, as well as 34 Master regulator genes for the Gabaergic developmental trajectory. Dynamic Boolean modeling of this systems showcased a comprehensive understanding of the disrupted developmental pathways of Rett syndrome, highlighting the transitional states of potential within maturation trajectories as the key point of divergence in regulation for Rett syndrome. After complementing with enrichment and clinical relevant variant analysis, we identify the key actors in this system as NR2F1 and TCF4, with TCF4 suggesting a symmetrical compensatory relationship with MeCP2, and NR2F1 as possible link with wider developmental conditions, this concluded with highlighting the possibility of regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation, offering a novel angle for targeted research.",

      "title": "Cerebral Bases and Neural Dynamics of Audiovisual Temporal Binding Window: a TMS study",
      "content": "The temporal binding window (TBW) refers to the time interval within which two stimuli, typically visual and auditory, are perceived as synchronous. Neural bases underlying this process consistently implicate a large-scale network with superior temporal sulcus (STS) as a central hub, alongside contributions from primary auditory and visual cortices and higher-order areas including prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. This study aimed to provide causal evidence for the involvement of superior temporal gyrus (STG) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in the simultaneity judgment (SJ) task using MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In particular, we aimed to clarify temporal dynamics of these regions in audiovisual synchrony perception. Forty adults performed an SJ task in which they had to determine whether stimuli were synchronous or asynchronous. Single-pulse TMS was applied over bilateral IPS, STG, or the vertex at different delays following stimulus offset. Early stimulation of left IPS and right STG increased the proportion of \"synchronous\" responses. In contrast, later stimulation of bilateral STG was associated with reduced synchrony perception. These findings provide causal evidence for a dynamic interplay between parietal and temporal regions in audiovisual temporal integration. Early IPS and STG involvement facilitates temporal integration, while later STG activity promotes perceptual segregation.",

      "title": "The Somatostatin Pathway Projected from the Basal Forebrain to the Lateral Habenula Promotes Isoflurane Anesthesia Recovery",
      "content": "<p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <i></i> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>",

      "title": "Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State",
      "content": "<p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<i>n</i> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>",

      "title": "Beta and High Gamma Oscillations in the Cortico-striatal Network Reflect Reward Certainty on a Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task",
      "content": "<p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Long-Term Nonexternally Reinforced Preference Change: Functional Connectivity Changes in a Longitudinal Functional MRI Study",
      "content": "<p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>",
