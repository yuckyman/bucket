Here, we developed a model inspired by the primate dorsal visual pathway and introduced a ...",

It is mainly for: \u2022 developers interested in program optimization \u2022 people exploring automated code evaluation \u2022 learning how correctness constraints affect optimization loops</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>Comparison Unlike many auto-optimization or AI coding tools that focus only on performance or code generation, this project enforces strict correctness checks at every step.</p> <p>It also explicitly detects regressions and uses convergence criteria (\u201cno improvement for N iterations\u201d) instead of running indefinitely.</p> <p>This makes the system more conservative but more stable compared to naive optimization loops.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>Source Code GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/byte271/Redo-Self-Improve-Agent\">https://github.com/byte271/Redo-Self-Improve-Agent</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cyh-c\"> /u/cyh-c </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q9j1tr/a_correctnessfirst_selfimproving_loop_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q9j1tr/a_correctnessfirst_selfimproving_loop_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",
