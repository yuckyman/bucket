      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Aversive Learning Induces Context-Gated Global Reorganization of Neural Dynamics in Caenorhabditis elegans",
      "content": "Learning generates experience-dependent changes to the brain. However, how neurons of diverse functions and connectivity reorganize and modulate their activities to generate coherent changes while preserving essential functions is not well understood. Here, we address this question using an aversive olfactory learning paradigm whereby Caenorhabditis elegans learns to reduce its olfactory preference for pathogenic bacteria. Using functional imaging during olfactory stimulation in naive and trained animals, we show that, at brain-wide scale, cell type-by-cell type, learning induces context-gated reconfiguration of the organization of neural activity throughout the brain to alter neural responses only during bacteria-discrimination task, while leaving intact bacteria-sensing functions. We found that the context-gated encoding of learning is globally distributed across layers of the nervous system, composed of neurons carrying information of context or learning experience. In particular, aversive training modulates multiple functional connections within the nervous system, including those between sensory neurons and interneurons, as well as those among interneurons, in a context-gated manner. At the systems level, training modulates correlated activity of neural populations; we found that low-dimensional temporal patterns of population activity correlate well with locomotory gaits that express olfactory preferences. Upon training, the rotation and contraction of the low-dimensional neural manifolds shifts the brain into predisposed states for the context-gated display of learned behavior. Because animals encounter unpredictable environments in life, efficient learning about relevant cues while maintaining other functions is essential for survival. Our findings uncover network-level mechanisms that help explain how the brain reorganizes its activity patterns to both encode new experience and preserve essential functions.",

      "title": "An artifact-robust framework for measuring tCS effects during stimulation",
      "content": "Objective: Transcranial current stimulation (tCS) is a promising technique to non-invasively modulate human brain activity. However, stimulation artifacts in EEG and MEG recordings severely hinder the study of its online effects. Approach: Here, we introduce a new approach to account for these artifacts. The approach rests on two key ideas. First, we focus on interactions of tCS with intrinsic brain activity, which are absent for tCS artifacts. Second, rather than removing artifacts, we compare composite signals that share similar artifacts but potentially differ in the interaction of tCS with intrinsic brain activity. We follow a simple logic: if tCS does not interact with intrinsic brain activity, then neural activity during simultaneous sensory stimulation and tCS should equal the linear superposition of the neural effects of each applied alone. Any deviation from this prediction provides evidence for a neural interaction. Main results: We tested this approach in a proof-of-principle MEG study, applying 10 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) during rest and during a 10 Hz visual flicker. We compared neural activity during simultaneous stimulation with that predicted by the linear superposition of flicker and tACS alone and found a phase-dependent interaction between tACS and flicker-evoked brain activity. Significance: Our work establishes a novel approach to investigate online effects of tCS and suggests a state-dependent interaction of tACS with human brain activity.",

Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
