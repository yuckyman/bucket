      "title": "Regional heterogeneity shapes macroscopic wave dynamics of the human and non-human primate cortex",
      "content": "Growing evidence indicates that macroscopic cortical activity is dominated by propagating waves of excitation. However, many computational models of such wave dynamics assume that the cortex is a spatially homogeneous medium, ignoring the rich regional variations in cellular, molecular, and physiological properties that are known to shape how brain activity evolves through both space and time. Here, we develop a general framework grounded in neural field theory to model how regional heterogeneities in diverse cortical properties shape spatiotemporal brain activity evolving on cortical surface meshes. This enables high resolution, vertex-level simulations without requiring predefined parcellations. The model requires only a standard mesh model of the cortical manifold and a spatial heterogeneity map, providing a biologically grounded and computationally efficient framework that can be generalised to human and non-human species. Using multiple cellular, molecular, and physiological maps in humans--and analogous maps in macaques and marmosets--we show that our model can consistently recapitulate known relationships between regional heterogeneities and variations in cortical wave speed. In particular, we find that models parameterised by heterogeneities in intracortical myelin and excitation-inhibition balance yield the largest performance improvements relative to spatially homogeneous models. Our results identify a key role for regional variations in myelin, receptor, and genetic architecture in shaping the spatial patterning of macroscale cortex-wide activity that is conserved across primate species with diverse cortical geometries.",

      "title": "Astrocytic response to traumatic brain injury to rescue neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial transfer",
      "content": "As highly dynamic organelles, mitochondria play an essential role in neuronal survival and synaptic function. Excitotoxicity is as a critical factor that promotes mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intercellular mitochondrial transfer and exogenous mitochondrial transplantation are emerging concepts to understand mitochondrial trafficking in response to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, robust in vivo evidence remains limited on the extent of these processes in the central nervous system (CNS). There is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of mitochondrial transfer mechanisms under both normal physiological conditions and after experimental TBI. Mouse lines expressing mitochondrial green-fluorescent dendra-2 (mtD2) and GFP (mtGFP) targeted to inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively, were used to study astrocyte-specific (Aldh1l1-CreER; mtD2f/f-AmtD2 and Aldh1l1-CreER; mtGFPf/f-AmtGFP) and neuron-specific (CamK2aCre; mtD2f/f-NmtD2 and CamK2aCre; mtGFPf/f-NmtGFP) mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in acute TBI and excitotoxicity. At 24 hrs following TBI, neurons in the NmtD2 mouse brain exhibited rapid and significant alterations in mitochondrial morphology, including changes in total mitochondrial volume, volume distribution, and sphericity. Synaptic neuronal (SN) mitochondria display robust deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics and complex protein levels while non-synaptic neuronal (NSN) mitochondria show State III bioenergetics and complex proteins at control levels. These findings are accompanied by a marked increase in astrocyte-derived mitochondria (AmtGFP) transfer to neurons at 24 hrs post-injury, compared to control animals, but no increase in transfer to neuronal synapses. While TBI also altered astrocytic mitochondrial morphology in the cortex, astrocytic mitochondrial bioenergetics remained preserved. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes revealed significant transcriptional reprogramming following TBI, characterized by the upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis and the machinery for organelle trafficking. In vitro co-cultures of primary cortical astrocytes and neurons demonstrated that astrocytes can transfer mitochondria to neurons via direct contact and that NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity further enhanced this astrocyte-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, astrocytic-derived extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EV-mito) deliver mitochondria to neurons and EV-mediated mitochondrial transfer significantly ameliorated NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cortical neurons. Together, these findings show that astrocytes take on a TBI-related phenotype that facilitates dynamic changes in mitochondrial networks and mitochondrial trafficking to neurons. Astrocytic transfer of respiratory-competent mitochondria support is an intrinsic neuroprotective response to injury that supports mitochondrial function in neuronal soma, dendrites, and axons but not at the neuronal synapse. Finally, we show therapeutic potential of exogenous mitochondrial transfer, particularly via EV-mito, for treating neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity, such as TBI.",

      "title": "Single-cell-resolved spatial multi-omics identifies mTOR-driven neuronal and astroglial pathogenicity underlying epileptogenic focal cortical dysplasia",
      "content": "Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a malformation of cortical development caused by somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. Two hallmark pathological cell types in FCDII, dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells (BCs), arise as a result of somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway and are implicated in the pathophysiology of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, how these somatic mutations reshape cell states within the human cortex remains poorly understood. Here, we integrate imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and proteomics of surgically resected FCDIIb tissue to define the transcriptional and proteomic profiles of DNs and BCs. Spatial mapping of iST data resolved transcriptional signatures in histologically validated DNs and BCs within FCDIIb sections. Integrative omics analysis further revealed that DNs show upregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and p53-CROT metabolic programs accompanied by suppression of synaptic signaling, whereas BCs exhibit transcriptional signatures of reactive astrocytes with increased phagocytic and immune-like activity. These data delineate cell-type-specific consequences of somatic mTOR pathway mutations at single-cell resolution and reveal previously unrecognized metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis in drug-resistant epilepsy. Our study establishes a spatial multi-omics framework for dissecting human cortical malformations and highlights potential therapeutic targets for drug-resistant epilepsy.",

      "title": "Super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics reveals cell-type and brain-region-specific modulation of key epitranscriptomic switches following adolescent alcohol exposure",
      "content": "Epitranscriptomic mechanisms dynamically regulate neuronal function through gene expression, but their precise roles in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders remain to be fully elucidated. A major obstacle to advancing such studies is the absence of a methodology for precise, cell-type and brain-region-specific quantification of critical epitranscriptomic regulators under these complex brain conditions. To overcome this challenge, we developed a super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics method to quantify key epitranscriptomic switches in intact brains. Using this method, we quantified the expression of Mettl3, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase enzyme recently shown to be upregulated in the amygdala after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rats. We observed a significant increase in cytoplasmic Mettl3 mRNA in neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglia, within the adult central amygdala and the CA1 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus following AIE. In contrast, no significant changes were observed across neurons, astrocytes, or microglia within the basolateral amygdala or the hippocampal CA3. Additionally, we found both the cytoplasmic density and subcellular localization of Mettl3 mRNA were dependent on the specific cell types and brain subregions examined. These results suggest that AIE increases Mettl3 expression in a highly cell-type-specific and spatially heterogeneous manner, underscoring the necessity of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics methods for studying transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic regulations under neurological conditions.",

      "title": "IGF1 peptide targets Rett Syndrome astrocytes to degrade IGF binding protein, rescue synaptogenesis and restore mitochondrial function",
      "content": "Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, leads to profound synaptic and circuit deficits in the brain. While neurons have historically been the focus of RTT pathology, emerging evidence implicates astrocytes in non-cell autonomous mechanisms that impair synaptic structure, function and development. Here, we uncover a central role for astrocyte-secreted IGFBP2 in mediating these deficits and demonstrate that treatment with an IGF1-derived peptide restores synapse formation by promoting IGFBP2 degradation. Using an indirect astrocyte-neuron co-culture system, we show that astrocytes derived from RTT model mice suppress excitatory synapse formation in wild-type neurons and that this impairment is reversed when RTT astrocytes are treated with IGF1(1-3) peptide. Proteomic analysis reveals elevated levels of IGFBP2 in RTT astrocytes and their conditioned media. IGF1(1-3) peptide treatment leads to proteasomal degradation of IGFBP2, increasing IGF1 bioavailability, restoring mitochondrial function, and enhancing downstream PI3K/Akt signaling in neurons. Our data define a molecular mechanism by which astrocyte dysfunction in RTT can be rescued and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of IGF1(1-3) peptide, including Trofinetide, an FDA-approved IGF1 peptide mimetic, in RTT.",
