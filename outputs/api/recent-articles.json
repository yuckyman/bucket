      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

      "title": "An Autophagy-Inducing Compound Reduces Tau Pathology, Microglia Reactivity, and Rescues Working Memory in 3xTg AD Mice",
      "content": "Background Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have validated the use of amyloid beta (A{beta})-clearing antibodies, which reduce A{beta} pathology but leave other disease hallmarks largely unaddressed. Since AD involves multiple pathological processes, additional strategies are needed to target complementary mechanisms. One such target is autophagy, a lysosomal mediated degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis that removes toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. This process is implicated in AD, as impaired lysosomal function promotes A{beta} and tau accumulation. Our laboratory recently identified a novel natural mitophagy-inducing compound (MIC) that may serve as a therapeutic intervention for AD. Methods We evaluated the effects of MIC in aged 3xTgAD mice, a transgenic model displaying both A{beta} and tau pathology. Mice received either standard diet or diet containing MIC beginning at age 4 months until 20 months on alternating weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic (NonTg) controls were included under standard and MIC-supplemented diets to assess compound effects during normal aging. Neuropathological changes were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, phosphorylated tau (pTau), and microglial reactivity. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess spatial learning and memory and the Y-maze to measure working memory. Results At 20 months of age, our neuropathological assessment showed that 3xTgAD mice fed an MIC-supplemented diet had a significant reduction in pTau accumulation and microglial reactivity, although A{beta} burden remained unchanged. At 15 months, MIC diet also improved spatial learning and memory in aged NonTg controls but not in 3xTgAD mice. However, in younger 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice, MIC restored working memory performance to NonTg levels, indicating an age-dependent therapeutic response. Conclusion MIC emerges as a potential modulator of tau pathology and neuroinflammation. As a naturally derived compound, MIC offers potential for combination therapy with FDA-approved A{beta}-clearing antibodies, enabling a multimodal approach to AD treatment that addresses amyloid, tau, and microglia-related pathology.",

      "title": "Acetylcholine reflects uncertainty during hidden state inference",
      "content": "To act adaptively, animals must infer features of the environment that cannot be observed directly, such as which option is currently rewarding, or which context they are in. These internal estimates, known as hidden states, guide behaviour but are inherently uncertain. Theoretical models propose that efficient inference requires tracking both the most likely state and the uncertainty of that estimate. While neural representations of state identity have been described in cortical and hippocampal circuits, the origin of uncertainty signals remains unclear. Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) reflects this uncertainty during hidden state inference. Using fibre photometry in mice performing a probabilistic two-armed bandit task, we found that ACh release in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus tracked recent omission history and predicted whether animals would switch choice on the next trial. Blocking muscarinic receptors with scopolamine selectively impaired loss-driven switching without affecting stable performance. A hidden-state inference model in which ACh modulated how uncertainty from past experience shaped future beliefs reproduced both the physiological and behavioural effects, whereas alternative models did not. These results identify ACh as a neuromodulatory signal reflecting uncertainty during hidden-state inference, linking theoretical models of belief updating to their biological implementation in the mammalian brain.",

Recent reports suggest that FGF13 is secreted and regulates neuronal VGSCs through interactions with extracellular domains of integral plasma membrane proteins, yet supportive data are limited. Using rigorous positive and negative controls, we show that transfected FGF13 is not secreted from cultured cells in a heterologous expression system nor is endogenous FGF13 secreted from cultured neurons. Further, employing multiple unbiased screens including proximity protein proteomics, our results suggest FGF13 remains within membranes and is unavailable to interact directly with extracellular protein domains.",

      "title": "Early impairment in dentate pattern separation in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation utilizes sparse neural coding to support memory formation. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the dentate undergoes extensive restructuring, including loss of local inhibition. It is unknown how circuit changes impact dentate network computations in awake behaving animals. Here we perform high-density tetrode recordings from the dentate in male rats treated with systemic kainic acid (KA) to induce TLE. In KA-treated rats, dentate spatial representations were less precise at the single neuron level, however the stability of the spatial code in representing repeated visits to the same location was retained at the population level. Despite spared spatial representation, the network computations for pattern separation were disrupted. The reorganized dentate network in KA-treated rats generated less distinct population activity patterns for different environments, specifically as a result of impaired rate-remapping. Changes in network computations paralleled impairments in a dentate-dependent memory task, potentially providing a link between altered pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These deficits were present in animals with confirmed dentate circuit reorganization that had not yet developed spontaneous seizures - suggesting that the dentate network changes underlying altered rate-remapping and impaired dentate-dependent memory occur early in epileptogenesis.",

      "title": "Causal role of the individual alpha phase in multisensory perception",
      "content": "The phase of alpha oscillations is proposed to reflect perceptual cycles. Yet, human EEG/MEG studies have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because they used correlative approaches that did not consider causal phase-perception relationships. In a multi-day computational EEG study, we developed the neurobehavioral link function (NBLF) as a new approach to model individual sinusoidal relationships between the alpha phase and multisensory perception and to test for causality. Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis. A follow-up psychophysical experiment confirmed individual phase-dependent effects at 5 and 10 Hz, but not 15 Hz. Our results suggest that the individual alpha phase causally modulates perceptual cycles in multisensory integration and advocate for personalized, phase-targeting strategies in neurotechnologies.",
