      "title": "Endothelial Adgrl2 expression and alternative splicing controls the cerebrovasculature",
      "content": "Central nervous system development requires parallel but interrelated processes of neural circuit assembly and vascularization. Intersecting between these two processes, the cell-adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Adgrl2 is expressed in select neuron populations where it has been found to localize and control the assembly of specific synaptic sites. Further, Adgrl2 is found to be expressed in select non-neuronal brain cells, where it is restricted to endothelial cells. Testing for Adgrl2 function in these cells, here we find that endothelial cell specific Adgrl2 deletion results in an impairment in cerebrovascular integrity. To understand how it might be possible for Adgrl2 to function independently in neuronal and endothelial contexts, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for differences in transcriptional identity between these cell classes. Doing so, we find that expression of Adgrl2 mRNA is subject to robust cell type-specific alternative splicing, resulting in distinct isoforms being produced in neurons compared to endothelial cells. Investigating the functional implication of this cell type-specific alternative splicing, we find that forced expression of the neuronal isoform of Adgrl2 in endothelial cells leads to alterations in cerebrovasculature properties. Morphologically, endothelial cells with the non-native neuronal Adgrl2 isoform induce the formation of ectopic glutamatergic synaptic contacts onto endothelial cells, indicating alternations in the cell-cell recognition process. Functionally, in direct contrast to endothelial Adgrl2 deletion, this genetic expression switch instead enhances blood brain barrier integrity. This overly restricted cerebrovascular function results in dysregulation of blood to cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis, enlargement of brain ventricles, and a higher likelihood in the development of hydrocephalus neurological disorder. As such, alternative splicing serves as a cell type specific mechanism that provides isoform specific Adgrl2 for discerning functions controlling neural circuit assembly and cerebrovascular homeostasis.",

      "title": "Dynamics of Dentate Gyrus Place Cells and Dentate Spikes Signal Spatial and Nonspatial Changes in Environments",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to play a key role in the formation of dissociable memory representations for similar contexts. Neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) receive highly processed spatial and nonspatial sensory information from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, respectively. Changes in spatially tuned firing patterns of DG place cells occur after spatial changes to an environment, but the degree to which DG place cells respond to ethologically relevant nonspatial stimuli is largely unknown. Spatial and nonspatial information is thought to be transmitted to the DG during discrete local field potential events called dentate spikes. Here, we tested the extent to which different spatial and nonspatial stimuli modulate place cell firing patterns and dentate spike dynamics. We performed extracellular recordings of DG place cells and local field potentials in rats of both sexes exploring a familiar spatial environment, in which social stimuli and nonsocial odors of varying ethological relevance were presented, and a novel spatial environment. As expected, DG place cells exhibited different firing patterns between familiar and novel environments. Remarkably, a small population of DG place cells changed their firing patterns when social but not nonsocial stimuli were presented in a familiar environment. Additionally, the occurrence of dentate spikes associated with lateral entorhinal cortex inputs increased during exploration of social but not nonsocial stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that the DG preferentially responds to social stimuli at neuronal and network levels, providing novel insights into how spatial and nonspatial information is integrated in the DG.",

      "content": "Stathmin-2 (STMN2) is a microtubule associated protein that plays a role in the stability of microtubules of axons in the nervous system of animals. In this study we generated a novel zebrafish STMN2 knockout (KO) model. STMN2 is represented by two genes in the zebrafish genome: stmn2a and stmn2b. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenic system we selected founder fish lines harbouring frameshift mutations in both genes and bred these together to generate a double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. Using these models, we observed increased developmental lethality in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model and impaired motor function at larval stages of development. Examination of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) revealed a slight increase in the number of orphaned NMJs in trunk musculature as well as a reduction in amplitude of miniature endplate currents in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. In a final series of experiments, we show impaired ventral root axon regrowth following transection in double stmn2a and stmn2b KO larvae. Our findings suggest that while not essential for motor axon development, loss of stmn2a and stmn2b expression perturbs the assembly of zebrafish NMJs during development resulting in a minor motor phenotype and impairs that ability to regenerate motor axons following injury.",

      "content": "Multidisciplinary evidence support a neurodevelopmental origin for schizophrenia, yet the mechanistic translation of known risk factors remains poorly understood. In this study, we leverage multi-lineage, forebrain-patterned organoids derived from monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia, integrating single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to uncover disease-associated gene expression and chromatin accessibility topics. By constructing fate probability maps, we identify an accelerated developmental trajectory emerging from a distinct, schizophrenia-associated radial glia cell state, and reveal unique interactions among schizophrenia risk genes through unbiased multimodal analyses. Further, we confirm that schizophrenia-enriched states persist in differentiated lineages and disrupt synaptic programs, accompanied by molecular and cellular phenotypes mimicking observed disease pathology. Collectively, our findings delineate an early disruption in forebrain development, providing novel mechanistic insights into the origins of schizophrenia risk.",

      "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Trans-synaptic Interaction with mGluR6 Contributes to ELFN1 Presynaptic Enrichment in Rod Photoreceptors",
      "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
