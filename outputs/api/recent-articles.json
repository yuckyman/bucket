      "title": "NeuroGaze: a hybrid EEG and eye-tracking brain-computer interface for hands-free interaction in virtual reality",
      "content": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been studied in clinical and laboratory contexts, but the rise of consumer-grade devices now allows exploration of their use in daily activities. Virtual reality (VR) provides a particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360\u00b0 cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. While the differing confirmation pipelines limit direct comparison of throughput metrics, NeuroGaze is positioned as a feasibility study illustrating trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and accessibility. It highlights the potential of consumer-grade BCIs for long-duration use and emphasizes the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

      "title": "Extent and activity of adult hippocampal neurogenesis",
      "content": "Our understanding of adult neurogenesis has advanced far since Joseph Altman reported newborn neurons in the adult rodent brain over 60 years ago, but only recently have we been able to directly interrogate its role in the brain. While the olfactory-associated neurogenesis seen in the subventricular zone of many other mammals is greatly diminished in humans, hippocampal neurogenesis persists and may have important roles for learning, memory, and emotional regulation. A reduction in neurogenesis may play a role in neurodegenerative disease, and recent studies have suggested that hippocampal neurogenesis counteracts age-associated cognitive decline. Neurogenesis is also negatively impacted by chronic stress, a major contributor to a wide variety of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, antidepressants have been shown to enhance neurogenesis, and some of their behavioral effects are driven by newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Little is known, however, about how these newborn neurons integrate into and contribute to the neural circuitry of the hippocampus. Recent evidence suggests that the behavioral implications of neurogenesis are driven by the activity of newborn neurons, which may or may not be coupled to the extent of cell proliferation. This review discusses what is known about these two elements of neurogenesis, and how a complete picture of both is necessary to fully understand their physiological implications.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "title": "Neural heterogeneity as a unifying mechanism for efficient learning in spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15723v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as \"quantums,\" which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of \"symbols\" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as \"human intuition.\" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the \"normalized centroid distance\" method derived from information compression perspective.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16266v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The maintenance of rail vehicles and infrastructure plays a critical role in reducing delays, preventing malfunctions, and ensuring the economic efficiency of rail transportation companies. Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered labeling interfaces tailored to annotators needs for Usability and User Experience. This study introduces a cost effective predictive maintenance system developed in the federally funded project DigiOnTrack, which combines structure borne noise measurement with supervised learning to provide monitoring and maintenance recommendations for rail vehicles and infrastructure in rural Germany. The system integrates wireless sensor networks, distributed ledger technology for secure data transfer, and a dockerized container infrastructure hosting the labeling interface and dashboard. Train drivers and workshop foremen labeled faults on infrastructure and vehicles to ensure accurate recommendations. The Usability and User Experience evaluation showed that the locomotive drivers interface achieved Excellent Usability, while the workshop foremans interface was rated as Good. These results highlight the systems potential for integration into daily workflows, particularly in labeling efficiency. However, areas such as Perspicuity require further optimization for more data intensive scenarios. The findings offer insights into the design of predictive maintenance systems and labeling interfaces, providing a foundation for future guidelines in Industry 4.0 applications, particularly in rail transportation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Comprehensively interpreting human behavior is a core challenge in human-aware artificial intelligence. However, prior works typically focused on body behavior, neglecting the crucial role of eye gaze and its synergy with body motion. We present GazeInterpreter - a novel large language model-based (LLM-based) approach that parses eye gaze data to generate eye-body-coordinated narrations. Specifically, our method features 1) a symbolic gaze parser that translates raw gaze signals into symbolic gaze events; 2) a hierarchical structure that first uses an LLM to generate eye gaze narration at semantic level and then integrates gaze with body motion within the same observation window to produce integrated narration; and 3) a self-correcting loop that iteratively refines the modality match, temporal coherence, and completeness of the integrated narration. This hierarchical and iterative processing can effectively align physical values and semantic text in the temporal and spatial domains. We validated the effectiveness of our eye-body-coordinated narrations on the text-driven motion generation task in the large-scale Nymeria benchmark. Moreover, we report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream tasks of action anticipation and behavior summarization. Taken together, these results reveal the significant potential of parsing eye gaze to interpret human behavior and open up a new direction for human behavior understanding.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16236v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a graphical labeling user interface for a monitoring and predictive maintenance system for trains and rail infrastructure in a rural area of Germany. Aiming to enhance rail transportation's economic viability and operational efficiency, our project utilizes cost-effective wireless monitoring systems that combine affordable sensors and machine learning algorithms. Given that a successful labeling phase is indispensable for training a supervised machine learning system, we emphasize the importance of a user-friendly labeling user interface, which can be optimally integrated into the daily work routines of annotators. The labeling system has been designed based on best practices in usability heuristics and will be validated for usability and user experience through a study, the protocol for which is presented here. The value of this work lies in its potential to reduce maintenance costs and improve service reliability in rail transportation, contributing to the academic literature and offering practical insights for research on effective labeling user interfaces, as well as for the development of labeling systems in the industry. Upon completion of the study, we will share the results, refine the system as necessary, and explore its scalability in other areas of infrastructure maintenance.",

      "title": "When Less is More: A Story of Failing Bayesian Optimization Due to Additional Expert Knowledge",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.16230v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The compounding of plastics with recycled material remains a practical challenge, as the properties of the processed material is not as easy to control as with completely new raw materials. For a data scientist, it makes sense to plan the necessary experiments in the development of new compounds using Bayesian Optimization, an optimization approach based on a surrogate model that is known for its data efficiency and is therefore well suited for data obtained from costly experiments. Furthermore, if historical data and expert knowledge are available, their inclusion in the surrogate model is expected to accelerate the convergence of the optimization. In this article, we describe a use case in which the addition of data and knowledge has impaired optimization. We also describe the unsuccessful methods that were used to remedy the problem before we found the reasons for the poor performance and achieved a satisfactory result. We conclude with a lesson learned: additional knowledge and data are only beneficial if they do not complicate the underlying optimization goal.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16214v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People today are overwhelmed by massive amounts of information, leading to cognitive overload and memory burden. Traditional visual memory augmentation methods are either effortful and disruptive or fail to align with user intent. To address these limitations, we propose Gaze Archive, a novel visual memory enhancement paradigm through active logging on smart glasses. It leverages human gaze as a natural attention indicator, enabling both intent-precise capture and effortless-and-unobtrusive interaction. To implement Gaze Archive, we develop GAHMA, a technical framework that enables compact yet intent-aligned memory encoding and intuitive memory recall based on natural language queries. Quantitative experiments on our newly constructed GAVER dataset show that GAHMA achieves more intent-precise logging than non-gaze baselines. Through extensive user studies in both laboratory and real-world scenarios, we compare Gaze Archive with other existing memory augmentation methods. Results demonstrate its advantages in perceived effortlessness, unobtrusiveness and overall preference, showing strong potential for real-world deployment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16133v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Beyond a simple notification of incoming calls or messages, more complex information such as alphabets and digits can be delivered through spatiotemporal tactile patterns (STPs) on a wrist-worn tactile display (WTD) with multiple tactors. However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16038v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current text-to-image models struggle to render the nuanced facial expressions required for compelling manga narratives, largely due to the ambiguity of language itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce an interactive system built on a novel, dual-hybrid pipeline. The first stage combines landmark-based auto-detection with a manual framing tool for robust, artist-centric face preparation. The second stage maps expressions using the LivePortrait engine, blending intuitive performative input from video for fine-grained control. Our case study analysis suggests that this integrated workflow can streamline the creative process and effectively translate narrative intent into visual expression. This work presents a practical model for human-AI co-creation, offering artists a more direct and intuitive means of ``infusing souls'' into their characters. Our primary contribution is not a new generative model, but a novel, interactive workflow that bridges the gap between artistic intent and AI execution.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15857v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Similar to social media bots that shape public opinion, healthcare and financial decisions, LLM-based ChatBots like ChatGPT can persuade users to alter their behavior. Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.",

      "title": "Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2410.03972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions, a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks: flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration, while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to tune the variability of RNN solutions, either to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model the individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.",
