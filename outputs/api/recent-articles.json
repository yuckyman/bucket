      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s been a while since this sub popped up on my feed. It\u2019s coming up more recently. I\u2019m noticing a shocking amount of toxicity on people\u2019s project shares that I didn\u2019t notice in the past. Any attempt to call out this toxicity is met with a wave of downvotes.</p> <p>For those of you who have been in the Reddit echo chamber a little too long, let me remind you that it is not normal to mock/tease/tear down the work that someone did on their own free time for others to see or benefit from. It *is* normal to offer advice, open issues, offer reference work to learn from and ask questions to guide the author in the right direction.</p> <p>This is an anonymous platform. The person sharing their work could be a 16 year old who has never seen a production system and is excited about programming, or a 30 yoe developer who got bored and just wanted to prove a concept, also in their free time. It does not make you a better to default to tearing someone down or mocking their work.</p> <p>You poison the community as a whole when you do so. I am not seeing behavior like this as commonly on other language subs, otherwise I would not make this post. The people willing to build in public and share their sometimes unpolished work is what made tech and the Python ecosystem what it is today, in case any of you have forgotten.</p> <p><strong>\u2014update\u2014</strong></p> <p>The majority of you are saying it\u2019s because of LLM generated projects. This makes sense (to a limit); but, this toxicity is bleeding into some posts for projects that are clearly are not vibe-coded (existed before the LLM boom). I will not call anyone by name, but I occasionally see moderators taking part or enabling the behavior as well.</p> <p>As someone commented, having an explanation for the behavior does not excuse the behavior. Hopefully this at least serves as a reminder of that for some of you. The LLM spam is a problem that needs to be solved. I disagree that this is the way to do it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/behusbwj\"> /u/behusbwj </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhdssm/when_did_destructive_criticism_become_normalized/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhdssm/when_did_destructive_criticism_become_normalized/\">[comments]</a></span>",
