      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound of the Human Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Reconfigures Resting State Connectivity: A Sham-Controlled fMRI Study",
      "content": "Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) can modulate human brain activity, but its impact on large-scale functional connectivity (FC) in vivo remains incompletely characterized. Here we asked whether brief tFUS to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) modulates its FC with other brain regions. In a sham-controlled, within-subject study of healthy adults (N=16), we measured resting-state blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, during, and after five minutes of tFUS (i.e., five 20-second sonications followed by 40 second pauses). Subject-level sgACC-whole-brain FC was analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model (fixed: time, condition, time x condition; random: subject). tFUS increased sgACC-whole brain connectivity after sonication relative to sham. A smaller, non-significant trend was observed during sonication. Baseline-controlled analyses were employed to rule out the possibility that the observed increase in FC was due to a \"regression to the mean\" effect. Interestingly, network-level analysis revealed a clear disassociation in the evolution of resting-state FC across the 15 minute recordings: during sham sessions, the sgACC's connectivity with the default mode network (DMN) increased, while FC with other networks was largely unchanged. On the other hand, active tFUS led to a notable increase in FC with non-DMN networks (especially the cognitive control network), while connectivity with the DMN was stable. These results provide whole-brain evidence that tFUS reconfigures network dynamics in the human brain, motivating clinical applications to disorders characterized by dysregulated brain activity.",

      "title": "The cyclic nucleotide binding sites of Swiss-Cheese, the Drosophila orthologue of human PNPLA6, are required for its catalytic function",
      "content": "Mutations in Swiss-cheese (SWS) or its vertebrate ortholog PNLPA6, also called Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE), cause progressive neuronal degeneration in Drosophila and mice and several complex syndromes in humans. These include mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, ataxia and blindness and several other symptoms. SWS and PNPLA6 are widely expressed in neurons and in several glial cell types in Drosophila and mice and both cell types require SWS/PNPLA6 function autonomously. SWS and PNPLA6 are structurally and functionally conserved because expression of human or mouse PNPLA6 can replace SWS in flies. These orthologues share several domains, including the highly conserved phospholipase domain that mediates its function in deacetylating phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine. In addition, they share three cyclic nucleotide binding sites and although about 10% of the known disease-causing mutations occur in these sites, their function is still unknown. We therefore generated mutations in these sites in SWS to address what consequences this has for the function of the protein. Mutating only one site (SWSG558E) results in a partially functional protein that rescues the sws knockdown and that decreases PC when overexpressed. However, mutating all three sites (SWS{Delta}CNB) renders SWS non-functional and results in an increase of PC when overexpressed, suggesting that cyclic nucleotide binding can regulate the phospholipase function.",

      "title": "Hierarchical Community Structure of the Adult Drosophila Connectome Reveals Conserved Circuit Archetypes",
      "content": "Biological neural networks can be meaningfully partitioned into sub-networks referred to as communities. Community structure is thought to support functional specialization, adaptability, and cost-efficient wiring. While many studies have focused on inter-regional brain networks, little is known about communities in connectomes mapped at the level of individual neurons and synapses. Here, we analyze the whole-brain Drosophila adult connectome using a nested stochastic block model to uncover its hierarchical community structure. We find that most of the roughly 1500 fine-scale communities--the smallest, and best resolved level of the hierarchy--are spatially compact, generally assortative, and aligned with known biological features such as neurotransmitter identity and cell type. Nonetheless, we find evidence of nonassortative communities, spatially co-localized within the optic lobe and vision-processing pathways. Seeking \"functional primitives\"--small circuits with functionally narrow feature profiles--we use data-driven clustering to group communities into 45 archetypical meta-clusters based on their spatial, functional, and molecular properties, revealing modular building blocks from which larger, functionally diverse communities are composed. This work advances our understanding of how structure and function are organized in the fruit fly brain and highlights the value of statistical network models in interpreting nanoscale connectomes.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "content": "Neurons are highly polarised cells that depend on mitochondria for energy and signalling homeostasis. Importantly, energy and signalling requirements vary considerably across individual neurons both spatially and temporally. Therefore, to fully understand neuronal mitochondria, methods are needed to analyse mitochondria in live cells over time. The nanotweezer, a minimally invasive single-cell sampling technique, enables precise extraction a individual mitochondria from defined subcellular locations. Here, we combine single-mitochondrial extraction from live neurons with mitochondrial gene expression tracking and mtDNA profiling. By tracking mitochondrial gene expression in the same neurons over time, we reveal a downregulation of mitochondrial genes MT-ND1 and MT-ATP6 following exposure to -synuclein aggregates, independent of the proximity of the aggregates to the sampled mitochondria. Our approach provides precise, dynamic measurements of mitochondrial composition and gene expression in vivo at single-organelle resolution, enabling mechanistic studies of neuronal mitochondrial heterogeneity and its perturbation in models of neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) is a rare but devastating clinical variant characterized by abrupt cognitive decline, yet the molecular features underlying this phenotype remain unknown. Tau oligomers (TauO) are key mediators of tau toxicity, but whether their biochemical properties differ across AD subtypes has not been examined in human brain. We isolated endogenous TauO from frontal cortex of well-characterized control, slowly progressive AD (spAD), and rpAD cases using T22 immunoprecipitation and performed ultrastructural, biochemical, and proteomic characterization. rpAD TauO displayed compact, densely aggregated morphology and exhibited the highest levels of disease-associated phosphorylation (pS396, pS422). Label-free proteomics revealed that control and spAD shared a robust TauO interactome enriched for translation, proteostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and vesicle trafficking. Strikingly, these modules were absent in rpAD, which instead showed selective enrichment for aldehyde detoxification, amino-acid and carbon metabolism, and actin-regulatory pathways. rpAD TauO demonstrated increased association with SERPINA1, ALDH9A1, MAPRE3, DPYSL2/3, and NFASC, and reduced association with MRPL17 and C9. Functionally, rpAD TauO induced the strongest toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these findings indicate that rpAD likely harbors a biochemically distinct TauO species, defining a molecular signature that may underpin its fulminant clinical progression and support the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.",

      "content": "Proper entrainment of the body's circadian rhythms to the environment is critical to human health. Light is one of the strongest cues driving circadian photoentrainment of the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via projections from the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Circadian research has historically centered males, and recent work has revealed multiple sex-differences in circadian circuitry and function, indicating that our understanding of this system in females is severely limited. Moreover, while recent studies have investigated the role of hormonal modulation of light responses, the additional possibility that ipRGC inputs may also be sex-dependent has not been directly tested. Here, we report that not only do ipRGCs in female mice show higher levels of melanopsin expression, but that melanopsin also plays a larger role in shaping circadian photic responses in females compared to males. Collectively, these results define a new retinal source for sex-dependent differences in circadian behavior.",

      "title": "VGF in the Nucleus Accumbens Regulates Synaptic and Opioid-Evoked Plasticity",
      "content": "Neuropeptides contribute to the functional complexity of the nucleus accumbens, and evaluating the mechanisms by which they influence reward neurocircuitry may reveal novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the role of the neuropeptide precursor VGF (non-acronymic) in the nucleus accumbens, and its contribution to synaptic and opioid-evoked plasticity and behavior. We first characterized VGF expression within the nucleus accumbens, then examined its impact on excitatory synaptic transmission, and finally disrupted its expression to assess its influence on opioid sensitivity. We found that VGF is expressed by interneurons and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, and the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 reduced excitatory synaptic transmission onto nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons. Conditional genetic knockout of VGF from the nucleus accumbens did not affect acute opioid sensitivity, but amplified opioid-evoked psychomotor sensitization following chronic fentanyl exposure. These results establish VGF as a modulator of nucleus accumbens synaptic and drug-evoked plasticity. Uncovering the impact of VGF on nucleus accumbens plasticity following exogenous opioid exposure may lead to novel therapeutic targets to treat opioid use disorders.",

      "title": "Functional implications of compartment-specific homeostatic regulation and the feasibility of independent local feedback signals",
      "content": "Neurons regulate their average firing rate by adjusting their synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability. Both forms of homeostatic regulation utilize changes in intracellular calcium as a feedback signal to adjust ion channel densities. But two properties cannot be independently regulated using a single feedback signal, suggesting that either synaptic scaling and excitability regulation are linked by a shared feedback signal or that local calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Past studies on homeostatic regulation have focused on global calcium changes but spatially restricted calcium changes also occur. We hypothesized that local perturbation-induced calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Simulations in a simple two-compartment model confirmed that a perturbation applied to one or the other compartment induces local compensation only if the feedback is compartment-specific. Simulations in a biophysically detailed multicompartment model with realistic calcium handling confirmed that dendritic and somatic calcium signals remain relatively segregated and can, therefore, mediate homoeostatic regulation independently in subcellular compartments. Strong perturbations (as often tested experimentally) triggered widespread compensation because local compensation was overwhelmed. Non-local compensation also occurred when the spatial segregation of calcium signaling was weakened. Our results demonstrate the plausibility of spatially segregated calcium changes encoding separate feedback signals so that homeostatic changes can be locally controlled. Our results also highlight that whereas local homeostatic regulation nullifies local perturbations through compensation within the affected compartment, non-local regulation causes widespread compensatory changes that, while restoring the neuron's overall input-output relationship, distorts the input-output relationship of individual compartments, with potentially important consequences.",

      "title": "Neuronal APOE4 reduction with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within the central nervous system (CNS), APOE is produced by a variety of cell types, with differential roles in AD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that APOE4 produced by neurons plays a central role in promoting the development of major AD pathologies, including p-tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role as an upstream initiating factor that affects other cell types and downstream AD-related pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting APOE-I3, a neuron-specific splicing variant of APOE mRNA, effectively reduce APOE expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Treating PS19 tauopathy mice expressing APOE4 with this APOE-I3-targeting ASO reduces neuronal APOE4, rescues neurodegeneration, and diminishes neuroinflammation. Strikingly, the extent of neuronal APOE4 reduction predicts the efficacy of rescuing neurodegeneration. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated that APOE-I3-targeting ASO treatment decreases disease associated neuronal and glial subtypes and increases a disease-protective microglial subtype. These findings suggest that preferential knockdown of neuronal APOE4 with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against key hallmarks of AD pathology, elucidating a potential therapeutic approach for treating APOE4-driven AD.",
