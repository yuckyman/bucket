      "title": "Chronotype-specific impacts of sleep-wake schedule on behavioral, physiological and psychological parameters",
      "content": "Diurnal variations in human performance are known to be associated with chronotype, which reflects individual differences in preferred sleep -wake cycles. Early chronotypes (ECs) exhibit superior motor and cognitive functions in the morning, whereas late chronotypes (LCs) tend to perform better in the evening. However, previous studies have examined these patterns under socially imposed nighttime sleep schedules, without considering individuals' preferred sleep timing. Thus, it remains unclear whether these chronotype-dependent performance peaks persist when individuals follow their preferred sleep schedules. To address this question, we measured subjective states, sleep pressure (using electroencephalography), and motor and cognitive functions at 1.5 and 12.5 hours after awakening under two conditions: the Clock-Time condition (10:30 PM - 6:30 AM sleep aligned with social rhythms) and the Self-Time condition (8 hours of sleep aligned with individual preferences). The results revealed distinct chronotype-specific patterns. ECs exhibited increases in fatigue and sleepiness dependent on awake duration, showing typical sleep pressure accumulation . LCs were more affected by sleep timing and showed atypical patterns of sleep pressure accumulation compared with ECs. Motor ability tended to improve in the afternoon in both chronotypes, irrespective of sleep-wake schedule, whereas cognitive performance peaked at different stages of wakefulness -earlier for ECs and later for LCs- independent of the time of day. These findings suggest that chronotype-aligned sleep-wake schedules could help optimize fatigue management, cognitive performance, and motor control. Diurnal variations in performance cannot be attributed to clock time alone but emerge from the combined effects of chronotype, awake duration, and sleep-wake regulation.",

      "content": "People tend to recall similar feelings when remembering the same event. Yet the neural mechanisms by which emotional valence and arousal are represented during perception and later recall remain unclear. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record prefrontal cortex activity while participants viewed and then freely recalled short video clips designed to elicit four affective states (amusement, calmness, disgust, and sadness). Multidimensional scaling revealed that both modality-general (shared across viewing and recall) and modality-specific (unique to each phase) dimensions of valence and arousal were significant, and cross-modal classification successfully decoded valence and arousal. Our results support a hierarchical model in which a stable core affect is preserved across perception and memory, while context-dependent refinements adapt emotional representations during recall. This work highlights fNIRS as a useful tool for studying emotional memory in ecologically valid settings and lays groundwork for multimodal imaging of affective replay.",

      "content": "Neurons have long, thin axons and branched dendritic processes which rely on an extensive microtubule network that functions as a cellular scaffold and substrate for cargo transport. Microtubule defects are a defining pathological feature of neurological disorders. The highly arborized, long, polarized neuronal processes pose challenges for imaging-based assays. Available methods use either dispersed cultures, which are inefficient for compartment-specific analyses, or microfluidic chambers, which allow clear separation of somatodendritic and axonal compartments but are expensive and difficult to maintain. Here, we introduce an i3Neurosphere culture model of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cortical i3Neurons that enables high-throughput imaging of hundreds of axons without specialized equipment. We characterize neurite outgrowth, polarization, microtubule dynamics, and motility of diverse cargo, providing a reference for future work on microtubule processes in this system. The high-throughput compartment-specific imaging we present, combined with facile genetic engineering in i3Neurons provides a powerful tool to study human neurons.",

      "title": "Fronto-Parietal Oscillatory Dynamics of Emotion Regulation as a Function of Adult Attachment Orientations",
      "content": "Emotion regulation enables individuals to modulate emotional experiences and behaviors according to situational demands. Within attachment theory, individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance are conceived as interpersonal dispositions that influence the quality and efficiency of emotion regulation strategies, potentially shaping the underlying neural dynamics. This study examined cortical oscillatory activity during two regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-focusing on theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) bands at the source level. Forty adults (21 male, 18 female, 1 gender-unspecified; M = 27.58 years, SD = 8.71) performed an emotion regulation task involving emotionally evocative images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while EEG was recorded. Cortical sources were reconstructed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) assessed the effects of condition, region of interest (ROI), and attachment orientations on oscillatory power. Results showed that higher attachment anxiety predicted reduced theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during reappraisal, indicating attenuated recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms. In the beta band, suppression reduced activity in the right parietal lobe/precuneus - a region involved in self-referential and attentional processes - across participants, while during reappraisal, attachment anxiety was linked to lower beta power and attachment avoidance to higher beta power in the left dlPFC. Together, these findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression engage distinct cortical oscillatory systems, and that interpersonal dispositions modulate their neural implementation. Frontal theta appears to index top-down control during reappraisal, whereas beta activity shows a dual pattern: frontal beta variations reflect differences in control stability associated with attachment orientations, and parietal beta decreases during suppression suggest attentional disengagement from self-referential processing.",

      "title": "Asymmetric blood flow within a shared capillary network links the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema",
      "content": "The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) form a tightly coupled dorsal medullary complex that integrates visceral and humoral signals governing autonomic and cardiometabolic regulation. While their neural interconnections are well characterized, the organization and functional significance of their shared vascular network remain poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in rats, combined with fluorescent vascular labeling and retrograde neuronal tracing, to visualize and quantify blood flow within the AP-NTS microcirculation. We identified direct capillary connections between the two regions, confirming a continuous vascular network previously inferred from ex vivo studies. Analysis of red blood cell trajectories revealed that blood flow across these junctions is predominantly unidirectional, from the NTS toward the AP. Morphometric measurements showed that AP capillaries are nearly twice the diameter of those in the NTS, implying a lower local vascular resistance and providing a structural basis for this directionality. Despite these geometric differences, capillary flow velocities were similar between regions, consistent with active regulation that maintains stable perfusion dynamics. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized, functionally asymmetric vascular pathway within the dorsal medulla. By enabling the directed transfer of diffusible neurohumoral signals from the NTS to the AP, this specialized microvascular network adds a novel layer of communication between two key brainstem autonomic centers and may represent an additional mechanism for the integration of visceral and circulating information.",
