      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "KeyNeg: Negative Sentiment Extraction using Sentence Transformers",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A very simple library for extracting negative sentiment, departure intent, and escalation risk from text.</p> <p>---</p> <p>What my project does?</p> <p>Although there are many methods available for sentiment analysis, I wanted to create a simple method that could extract granular negative sentiment using state-of-the-art embedding models. This led me to develop <strong>KeyNeg</strong>, a library that leverages </p> <p>sentence transformers to understand not just that text is negative, but why it's negative and how negative it really is.</p> <p>In this post, I'll walk you through the mechanics behind KeyNeg and show you how it works step by step.</p> <p>---</p> <p>The Problem</p> <p>Traditional sentiment analysis gives you a verdict: positive, negative, or neutral. Maybe a score between -1 and 1. But in many real-world applications, that's not enough:</p> <p>- HR Analytics: When analyzing employee feedback, you need to know if people are frustrated about compensation, management, or workload\u2014and whether they're about to quit</p> <p>- Brand Monitoring: A negative review about shipping delays requires a different response than one about product quality</p> <p>- Customer Support: Detecting escalating frustration helps route tickets before situations explode</p> <p>- Market Research: Understanding why people feel negatively about competitors reveals opportunities</p> <p>What if we could extract this nuance automatically?</p> <p>---</p> <p>The Solution: Semantic Similarity with Sentence Transformers</p> <p>The core idea behind KeyNeg is straightforward:</p> <ol> <li><p>Create embeddings for the input text using sentence transformers</p></li> <li><p>Compare these embeddings against curated lexicons of negative keywords, emotions, and behavioral signals</p></li> <li><p>Use cosine similarity to find the most relevant matches</p></li> <li><p>Aggregate results into actionable categories</p> <p>Let's walk through each component.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 1: Extracting Negative Keywords</p> <p>First, we want to identify which words or phrases are driving negativity in a text. We do this by comparing n-grams from the document against a lexicon of negative terms.</p> <p>from keyneg import extract_keywords</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>Management keeps changing priorities every week. No clear direction,</p> <p>and now they're talking about another restructuring. Morale is at</p> <p>an all-time low.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>keywords = extract_keywords(text)</p> <p># [('restructuring', 0.84), ('no clear direction', 0.79), ('morale is at an all-time low', 0.76)]</p> <p>The function extracts candidate phrases, embeds them using all-mpnet-base-v2, and ranks them by semantic similarity to known negative concepts. This captures phrases like &quot;no clear direction&quot; that statistical methods would miss.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 2: Identifying Sentiment Types</p> <p>Not all negativity is the same. Frustration feels different from anxiety, which feels different from disappointment. KeyNeg maps text to specific emotional states:</p> <p>from keyneg import extract_sentiments</p> <p>sentiments = extract_sentiments(text)</p> <p># [('frustration', 0.82), ('uncertainty', 0.71), ('disappointment', 0.63)]</p> <p>This matters because the type of negativity predicts behavior. Frustrated employees vent and stay. Anxious employees start job searching. Disappointed employees disengage quietly.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 3: Categorizing Complaints</p> <p>In organizational contexts, complaints cluster around predictable themes. KeyNeg automatically categorizes negative content:</p> <p>from keyneg import analyze</p> <p>result = analyze(text)</p> <p>print(result['categories'])</p> <p># ['management', 'job_security', 'culture']</p> <p>Categories include:</p> <p>- compensation \u2014 pay, benefits, bonuses</p> <p>- management \u2014 leadership, direction, decisions</p> <p>- workload \u2014 hours, stress, burnout</p> <p>- job_security \u2014 layoffs, restructuring, stability</p> <p>- culture \u2014 values, environment, colleagues</p> <p>- growth \u2014 promotion, development, career path</p> <p>For HR teams, this transforms unstructured feedback into structured data you can track over time and benchmark across departments.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 4: Detecting Departure Intent</p> <p>Here's where KeyNeg gets interesting. Beyond measuring negativity, it detects signals that someone is planning to leave:</p> <p>from keyneg import detect_departure_intent</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>I've had enough. Updated my LinkedIn last night and already</p> <p>have two recruiter calls scheduled. Life's too short for this.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>departure = detect_departure_intent(text)</p> <p># {</p> <p># 'detected': True,</p> <p># 'confidence': 0.91,</p> <p># 'signals': ['Updated my LinkedIn', 'recruiter calls scheduled', &quot;I've had enough&quot;]</p> <p># }</p> <p>The model looks for:</p> <p>- Job search language (&quot;updating resume&quot;, &quot;interviewing&quot;, &quot;recruiter&quot;)</p> <p>- Finality expressions (&quot;done with this&quot;, &quot;last straw&quot;, &quot;moving on&quot;)</p> <p>- Timeline indicators (&quot;giving notice&quot;, &quot;two weeks&quot;, &quot;by end of year&quot;)</p> <p>For talent retention, this is gold. Identifying flight risks from survey comments or Slack sentiment\u2014before they hand in their notice\u2014gives you a window to intervene.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 5: Measuring Escalation Risk</p> <p>Some situations are deteriorating. KeyNeg identifies escalation patterns:</p> <p>from keyneg import detect_escalation_risk</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>This is the third time this quarter they've changed our targets.</p> <p>First it was annoying, now it's infuriating. If this happens</p> <p>again, I'm going straight to the VP.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>escalation = detect_escalation_risk(text)</p> <p># {</p> <p># 'detected': True,</p> <p># 'risk_level': 'high',</p> <p># 'signals': ['third time this quarter', 'now it's infuriating', 'going straight to the VP']</p> <p># }</p> <p>Risk levels:</p> <p>- low \u2014 isolated complaint, no pattern</p> <p>- medium \u2014 repeated frustration, building tension</p> <p>- high \u2014 ultimatum language, intent to escalate</p> <p>- critical \u2014 threats, legal language, safety concerns</p> <p>For customer success and community management, catching escalation early prevents public blowups, legal issues, and churn.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Step 6: The Complete Analysis</p> <p>The analyze() function runs everything and returns a comprehensive result:</p> <p>from keyneg import analyze</p> <p>text = &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>Can't believe they denied my promotion again after promising it</p> <p>last year. Meanwhile, new hires with half my experience are getting</p> <p>senior titles. I'm done being patient\u2014already talking to competitors.</p> <p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>result = analyze(text)</p> <p>{</p></li> </ol> <p>'keywords': [('denied my promotion', 0.87), ('done being patient', 0.81), ...],</p> <p>'sentiments': [('frustration', 0.88), ('resentment', 0.79), ('determination', 0.65)],</p> <p>'top_sentiment': 'frustration',</p> <p>'negativity_score': 0.84,</p> <p>'categories': ['growth', 'compensation', 'management'],</p> <p>'departure_intent': {</p> <p>'detected': True,</p> <p>'confidence': 0.89,</p> <p>'signals': ['talking to competitors', &quot;I'm done being patient&quot;]</p> <p>},</p> <p>'escalation': {</p> <p>'detected': True,</p> <p>'risk_level': 'medium',</p> <p>'signals': ['denied my promotion again', 'after promising it last year']</p> <p>},</p> <p>'intensity': {</p> <p>'level': 4,</p> <p>'label': 'high',</p> <p>'indicators': [&quot;Can't believe&quot;, &quot;I'm done&quot;, 'already talking to competitors']</p> <p>}</p> <p>}</p> <p>One function call. Complete picture.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Target Audience: </p> <p>HR &amp; People Analytics</p> <p>- Analyze employees posts through public forum (Thelayoffradar.com, thelayoff.com, Glassdoor, etc..)</p> <p>- Analyze employee surveys beyond satisfaction scores</p> <p>- Identify flight risks before they resign</p> <p>- Track sentiment trends by team, department, or manager</p> <p>- Prioritize which issues to address first based on escalation risk</p> <p>Brand &amp; Reputation Management</p> <p>- Monitor social mentions for emerging crises</p> <p>- Categorize negative feedback to route to appropriate teams</p> <p>- Distinguish between customers who are venting vs. those who will churn</p> <p>- Track sentiment recovery after PR incidents</p> <p>Customer Experience</p> <p>- Prioritize support tickets by escalation risk</p> <p>- Identify systemic issues from complaint patterns</p> <p>- Detect customers considering cancellation</p> <p>- Measure impact of product changes on sentiment</p> <p>Market &amp; Competitive Intelligence</p> <p>- Analyze competitor reviews to find weaknesses</p> <p>- Identify unmet needs from negative feedback in your category</p> <p>- Track industry sentiment trends over time</p> <p>- Understand why customers switch between brands</p> <p>---</p> <p>Installation &amp; Usage</p> <p>KeyNeg is available on PyPI:</p> <p>pip install keyneg</p> <p>Minimal example:</p> <p>from keyneg import analyze</p> <p>result = analyze(&quot;Your text here&quot;)</p> <p>print(result['negativity_score'])</p> <p>print(result['departure_intent'])</p> <p>print(result['categories'])</p> <p>The library uses sentence-transformers under the hood.

As soon as you need to create or disable API keys at runtime, especially with horizontal scaling and multiple workers, they break down.</li> <li>the security aspects are very basic: keys are stored in plaintext, with no hashing using salt and pepper to protect them in case of a leak, and no protection against brute-force attempts.</li> <li>Since Argon2 or Bcrypt hashing is costly, a cache-agnostic system (InMemory / Redis) exists using aiocache, which invalidates itself after a certain amount of time or if the API key is changed (update/delete).</li> </ul> <p><code>fastapi-api-key</code> aims to sit in the middle:</p> <ul> <li>more structured and scalable than \u201cone API key in <code>.env</code> + a dependency\u201d,</li> <li>but lighter and more focused than a full-blown auth server or external API key manager service.</li> </ul> <p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the API design, project architecture, security model, and any specific use cases I might have missed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/__secondary__\"> /u/__secondary__ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgwr7m/fastapiapikey_a_backendagnostic_productionready/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgwr7m/fastapiapikey_a_backendagnostic_productionready/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "Modeling and validation in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with frailty",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The risk of frailty is significantly higher in patients with PD than in age-matched individuals without PD. This study aimed to develop a machine learning\u2013based predictive model for frailty in PD.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of early- and middle-stage PD patients recruited from June 2024 to June 2025 at Shenzhen People\u2019s Hospital. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria (five components: gait speed, grip strength, physical activity, fatigue, and weight loss). A total of 42 demographic and clinical variables, including disease history, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores, were collected and compared between PD patients with and without frailty. Spearman correlation and LASSO regression were used to identify independent risk factors. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the ROC curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration plots, and forest plots.ResultsA total of 205 PD patients were enrolled (133 non-frail, 72 frail; mean age non-frail 62.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.69\u202fyears, frail 68.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.44\u202fyears). Significant group differences were found in sex (p\u202f=\u202f0.013), age (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), disease severity (MDS-UPDRS, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; modified Hoehn-Yahr stage (H&amp;Y stage), p\u202f<\u202f0.001), alcohol consumption (p\u202f=\u202f0.010), MoCA (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), HAMD (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Eight features were identified as independent predictors of frailty: sex, age, alcohol use, Modified H&amp;Y stage, UPDRS-IV score, HAMA score, executive function, and naming. Among all tested algorithms, logistic regression achieved the best predictive performance (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.83 in the test set), outperforming other machine learning models.ConclusionFrailty in PD was associated with female sex, older age, alcohol use, and more advanced disease severity. Patients with PD and frailty exhibited higher MDS-UPDRS scores, more severe cognitive impairment, and greater levels of depression and anxiety. Integrating clinical data with machine learning, especially logistic regression, provides a reliable and scalable tool for early identification and risk stratification of frailty in PD.",
