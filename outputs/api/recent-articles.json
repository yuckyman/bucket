      "title": "Distinct Cortical and Oculomotor Dynamics During Endogenous and Exogenous Competition in Working Memory",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) enables the temporary maintenance of information for guiding thought and action, but its limited capacity requires internal selective attention mechanisms to prioritize goal-relevant representations. Like external attention, internal selection can be shaped by both endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (stimulus-driven) factors. Classic work by Charles Folk and Roger Remington demonstrated that such factors interact competitively during external attention, producing stimulus-driven capture under certain conditions. Whether similar competitive dynamics govern internal selection remains unclear. Here, we combined EEG and eye-tracking to examine how endogenous and exogenous influences interact during the selection of information held in working memory. Participants remembered two oriented bars and used either a pro-cue or an anti-cue to guide recall. Behavioral responses and lateralized alpha-band activity revealed robust delays in selecting task-relevant WM content under competition. In contrast, oculomotor biases toward memorized locations emerged with similar timing across pro- and anti-cue conditions, providing no evidence for retro-capture or delayed selection. These findings indicate that internal selection does not resolve competition via rapid capture, as in external attention, but through time-extended cortical processes. Our results highlight functional dissociations between cortical and oculomotor systems and offer new insight into how internal attention implements selection under competitive demands.",

      "title": "Locus coeruleus degeneration is associated with cortical tau deposition and cognitive decline in older adults at familial risk of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first sites of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may seed neocortical tau. METHODS We used longitudinal neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to assess LC integrity in vivo in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired older adults with familial risk of AD in relation to tau and amyloid PET and long-term cognitive trajectories. RESULTS We showed that both LC integrity at baseline and its rate of degeneration over time independently predicted a neocortical pattern of tau deposition. In keeping with the known function of the LC, neuropsychological tests showed that LC integrity at baseline predicted changes in attention. Finally, we found that longitudinal LC degeneration correlated with memory decline in people with elevated neocortical amyloid burden. DISCUSSION Our findings underscore the importance of LC in AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal measurement of LC degeneration may help distinguish trajectories of age-related cognitive decline and early AD.",

      "title": "Novel Cln8 p.R24G mouse line replicates major clinical features of Northern epilepsy",
      "content": "Rationale. Northern epilepsy belongs to a group of genetically diverse lysosomal storage diseases, the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). A characteristic feature of NCL pathology is the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the central nervous system. Northern epilepsy is a late-infantile -onset disease. Patients develop normally until 5-10 years old when they first present with general tonic-clonic seizures, followed by progressive cognitive impairment and a decline in motor skills. Northern epilepsy is caused by a missense variant in CLN8, causing a p.R24G amino acid substitution. CLN8 deficiency has been studied traditionally using motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice, which carry a spontaneous frame shift variant in the murine orthologue Cln8, which is not known to exist in humans. Methods. We have generated the first Cln8 p.R24G mouse model (Cln8R24G) using CRISPR/Cas9. Phenotyping analysis of the mice was conducted using behavioral and histopathological studies focusing on the brain and retina. Results. At birth, Cln8R24G KI mice were viable and asymptomatic. As the mice aged, a progressive accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C was evident in different brain regions and retinal layers. Health monitoring revealed that mutant mice developed progressive but mild motor symptoms around 7 months of age. Spontaneous epileptic seizures, like those observed in Northern epilepsy patients, were detected and recorded. An increase in FosB staining intensity, reflecting neuronal hyperactivity, was observed in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells and correlated well with the intensity of seizure activity. Neuroinflammation was evident at 4 months and increased dramatically with age, mainly in the thalamic VPN/VPL nuclei and moderately in the cortex. Neurodegeneration was most prominent in the VPN/VPL thalamic nuclei. Conclusions. We have generated the Cln8R24G mouse model that genocopies, for the first time, the pathogenic CLN8 variant present in patients with Northern epilepsy. These mice phenocopy major clinical features of the human disease, including mild motor impairment and, unlike the mnd mice, spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We hypothesize that our mouse model will open new possibilities for developing and testing targeted treatment options for Northern epilepsy and, more broadly, for early-onset neurodegenerative disorders associated with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Long-lasting structural and functional maturation in transplanted human neurons reprogrammed from glial progenitor cells",
      "content": "Direct reprogramming of brain-resident glial progenitor cells (GPCs) into induced neurons (iN) shows great promise for future regenerative therapies for brain diseases. This type of cell conversion is facilitated by introducing lineage-specific transcription factors or small molecules to somatic cells, and can even be achieve in vivo, targeting resident glia cells in the brain for in vivo conversion. While this have shown promising results in animal models, a crucial step is to show the long-term survival and maturation of human reprogrammed cells in vivo. However, this remains largely unexplored partly due to the inaccessible cell source of GPC and difficulty in transplanting converted neurons. In this study, we assessed human GPCs derived iNs for their long-term structural and functional neuronal maturation after transplantation to the immunodeficient mouse brain. GPCs were transduced with established transcription factor cocktail and transplanted to the medial prefrontal cortex as three-dimensional cultures to improve survival and integration upon transplantation. Our results reveal survival of hiNs, for up to 10 months post-transplantation (MPT) and wide distribution across local and proximal functionally connected brain regions. Morphological analysis revealed a gradual neuronal maturation over time, characterized by increase in cellular complexity and expression of neuronal markers. Supporting these findings, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated progressive functional maturation up to 5 MPT with increase in sodium and potassium currents, and the ability to generate multiple evoked and spontaneous action potentials, validating a neuronal phenotype. Importantly, these changes were absent in control grafts of non-converted hGPCs that retained their glia identity. Our findings indicate that hGPCs derived iNs maintain a stable neuronal phenotype that persist in the mouse brain for extended periods. These cells exhibit survival and remarkable adaptability to the host environment, enabling both structural and functional maturation over time. These results highlight their potential as a promising strategy for neural replacement therapies aimed at restoring damaged circuits and promoting brain repair.",

      "title": "FDTest: Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a Test for Memory Effects in Brain Dynamics",
      "content": "A central challenge in neuroscience is to understand how the brain flexibly balances local and distributed information processing to support diverse cognitive and conscious states. We hypothesize that a key signature of this balance is the presence of memory effects, which arise when a brain region's future activity depends not only on its current state, but also on past information fed back from the wider network. Here we introduce the FDTest, a method for assessing local memory effects in multidimensional systems by measuring violations of a generalized Fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We first apply this framework to whole-brain models fitted to human neuroimaging data, showing that the brain's memory structure reflects its underlying connectivity. We then extend the analysis to individualized models of subjects during wakefulness and deep sleep. Memory effects are consistently stronger in wakefulness, indicating richer inter-regional dependencies and more integrated dynamics. These findings establish local memory as a dynamical marker of brain state and position the FDTest as a principled tool for probing the hidden structure of neural dynamics in both models and experiments.",

      "content": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid constituent of the cannabis plant that shows promise for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region in the etiologies of these disorders and is actively modulated by CBD. Prior research has established that CBD alters the molecular composition of the NAc, but none have assessed how CBD affects NAc neuronal function. In this study, we demonstrate that CBD significantly decreases D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron membrane excitability, broadens action potentials, and has no effect on spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc core. These data enhance our understanding of CBDs physiological effects and provide mechanistic insight into its therapeutic potential.",

      "content": "Cranial nerves densely innervate the heart and vasculature, with sensory neurons reporting on blood pressure, respiratory gases, and tissue damage. The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here, we use genetic tools for isolated study of vagal mechanoreceptors in the heart, finding that they are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and play key roles in compensating for decreased filling of the heart that occurs in an upright posture and during hemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart and display blood volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout eliminates heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, and compromises carotid blood pressure when mice on a tilt-table are rotated to an upright position. Vagal PIEZO2 knockout mice also display a lethal failure to sustain blood pressure during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate an essential function for vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors in sustaining the constancy of blood circulation.",

      "title": "The language network responds robustly to sentences across diverse tasks",
      "content": "A network of left frontal and temporal brain areas supports language comprehension and production, implementing computations related to word retrieval and combinatorial linguistic processing. Here, we ask: are computations over linguistic input driven in a bottom-up way, by the input, or in a top-down way, by task demands? Participants (n=52) read sentences and nonword lists under six task conditions, including passive reading, reading with a memory probe at the end, and tasks that require deep semantic engagement. The sentences>nonwords contrast isolated the same set of language-responsive voxels across all tasks; the locations of those voxels were participant-specific, highlighting the value of individual-specific functional localization. We therefore conclude that language localization is robust to task variation. We then examined responses to each task in these language-responsive voxels (the language network) and in the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network, known to respond to task demands. The language network responded robustly to sentences across all tasks, with somewhat higher responses to semantically engaging tasks. In contrast, the MD network responded to both sentences and nonwords in the presence of a demanding task, which warrants caution when examining brain responses to language tasks accompanied by task demands, as such tasks engage two independent systems. A multivariate analysis revealed that stimulus information is more easily decodable in the language network, whereas task information is more decodable in the MD network. These results suggest that the language and MD networks perform complementary functions during task-driven language comprehension, with the language network primarily extracting information from linguistic input and the MD network determining the appropriate response to the task.",

      "content": "Biological neural networks contain diverse cell types with heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) model computational aspects of biology but use homogeneous neurons, limiting realism. A key obstacle to building bio-inspired ANNs is the absence of a database of neuron models that both fit biological data and remain differentiable for gradient-based learning. We present such a database: over 1,000 differentiable single-neuron firing-rate models with accompanying PyTorch code for integration with machine learning. The models belong to the linear-nonlinear (LN) class, which, for ease of reference, we term Generalized Firing Rate (GFR) neurons. Each GFR neuron uses input and firing-rate history filters across multiple timescales, followed by a nonlinearity to generate firing rates. Models are fit to patch-clamp recordings from mouse and human central nervous system slices. Parameter clustering reflects electrophysiological diversity and partially aligns with transgenic lines. This resource will enable development of bio-inspired ANNs built from biologically grounded, differentiable single-neuron models.",

      "content": "Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are high-frequency events critical for memory consolidation, typically studied during sleep and quiet wakefulness. Emerging evidence suggests that SWRs also occur during active behavior, yet their role in awake cognition remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that changes in sustained attention modulate both the occurrence of SWRs and their temporal alignment to ongoing hippocampal oscillations. Using intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients performing a sustained attention to response task (SART), we first identified attentional states based on behavioral variability and subjective reports. Next, we observed that SWRs were more frequent during high-attention periods, despite the absence of memory demands. Importantly, SWRs during low-attention periods showed higher phase synchrony with low-frequency oscillations (theta to lower beta) indicating increased endogenous coordination of SWRs under low attentional focus. These findings show that SWRs are dynamically regulated by attentional engagement, supporting a broader role for ripples in active cognitive processing.",
