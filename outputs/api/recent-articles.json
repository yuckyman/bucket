      "title": "Differential isoform-specific control of KCC2 function in developing cortical neurons",
      "content": "The K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 is essential for fast synaptic inhibition in the mature brain. It is encoded by a single gene and expressed as two isoforms: KCC2a and KCC2b, which differ in their N-terminal domains. While KCC2b is predominant, the function of the weakly expressed KCC2a isoform remains unclear. Here, we reveal that KCC2a is a potent, bidirectional regulator of KCC2b membrane stability and function in cortical neurons. In immature neurons, where WNK-SPAK kinase activity is high, KCC2a promotes SPAK-dependent phosphorylation of KCC2b at Thr1007, which likely contributes to hindering its membrane expression and function. Conversely, in mature neurons with low basal WNK-SPAK activity, KCC2a promotes KCC2b expression, clustering, and function. At this stage, although accounting for less than 5% of total KCC2 mRNA, KCC2a is enriched in dendrites and within KCC2 clusters, where it prevents clathrin-mediated KCC2b endocytosis, as well as polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, KCC2a acts as a developmental switch that first inhibits KCC2b during early development and then ensures its membrane stability to support effective synaptic inhibition in the adult brain.",

      "content": "The MNI152 template is widely regarded as a representative average brain in neuroimaging, computational modeling, and neuromodulation research; however, its fidelity as a true population mean has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we compared the MNI152 6th generation nonlinear template to 436 individual MRI from a publicly available dataset, including Asian, Black, and White participants. We quantified the gross brain dimensions and extracted the mean scaling, shear, and voxel-wise Jacobian determinants from the linear and nonlinear registrations between the template and each subject. Across all racial groups, the MNI152 brain exhibited substantially larger radii than the population means, with z-scores frequently exceeding 1.0. The linear scaling factors indicated consistent contraction of the template, and voxel-wise Jacobian fields revealed spatially heterogeneous deformations, demonstrating that the template differs from real brains in both size and shape. These findings suggest that the MNI152 template does not reflect the average morphology of contemporary population samples and that linear registration alone cannot resolve these discrepancies. Therefore, more robust and unbiased template-generation pipelines may be necessary for applications requiring anatomically accurate head models.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study investigated the distinct mechanistic pathways linking depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline in Parkinson\u2019s disease, with emphasis on differential roles of daytime sleepiness versus rapid eye movement sleep disorder.ParticipantsThe study included 450 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients enrolled in the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) between 2010 and 2024, leveraging longitudinal clinical and biomarker data.MeasurementsDepressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), sleep disturbances (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS for daytime sleepiness; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire, RBDSQ), and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) were analyzed using mixed-effects models and structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapped mediation.ResultsStructural equation modeling demonstrated excellent model fit (CFI/TLI\u202f>\u202f0.94; RMSEA < 0.08). Analyses revealed distinct pathological pathways: (1) Excessive daytime sleepiness impaired cognition fully through depression mediation (indirect effect \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.084, 95%CI [\u22120.097,-0.028], 66.1% mediated), while (2) REM sleep behavior disorder showed both direct negative effects on cognition (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.116, p\u202f=\u202f0.035) and depression-mediated effects (indirect effect \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.071, 95%CI [\u22120.110,-0.029], 38.2% mediated). These results highlight different intervention targets - treating depressive symptoms may fully mitigate cognitive impacts of daytime hypersomnia, while RBD may require both antidepressant and direct neuroprotective approaches.ConclusionDivergent neurobehavioral mechanisms underlie sleep-related cognitive decline in PD: daytime sleepiness operates through mood dysregulation, while rapid eye movement sleep disorder involves additional direct neural insult. Interventions targeting these pathways may require distinct strategies.",

      "title": "Hormonal control of postmitotic neuronal identity",
      "content": "The Drosophila central complex is a brain region that coordinates complex behaviors through precisely wired circuits composed of diverse neuronal subtypes. Dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons integrate internal-state signals to regulate sleep, feeding, and energy homeostasis, yet how dFB subtypes are specified and maintained remains unclear. More importantly, how a developmental transcription factor regulates neuronal identity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the developmental origin and post-mitotic regulation of neuronal identity in dFB subtypes labeled by the 84C10 driver, which innervates layers 6-7 of the fan-shaped body and contributes to nutrient sensing and metabolic adaptation. Using lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and birth-dating, we show that 84C10 dFB neurons derive primarily from the DL1 type II neural stem cell lineage, with a minor contribution from DM4, and are generated during a late larval temporal window after ~48 h after larval hatching (ALH). These late-born neurons maintain expression of ecdysone-responsive transcription factor E93 into adulthood. Selective postmitotic knockdown of E93 in mature 84C10 neurons causes progressive neuronal loss, ectopic expansion of axonal arborizations across fan-shaped body layers, and downregulation of the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT. These circuit defects are accompanied by a failure to mount normal triglyceride accumulation in response to high-sugar feeding. Together, our results demonstrate that a late temporal transcription factor, E93, is retained post-mitotically to preserve neuronal survival, layer-specific connectivity, and neurotransmitter identity in a behaviorally relevant dFB population, revealing how developmental programs are repurposed to sustain the long-term function of adult behavioral circuits.",
