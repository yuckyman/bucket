      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "title": "The modulatory effect of evaluative valence on fear generalization in social anxiety: an SSVEP study",
      "content": "BackgroundSocial anxiety is characterized by excessive sensitivity and concern about social evaluation. While previous research has demonstrated attentional bias and fear generalization in socially anxious individuals, the neural mechanisms by which different evaluative valences modulate this process remain unclear.MethodThis study employed a fear generalization paradigm combined with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Fifty-one college students were recruited and divided into high (n = 25) and low (n = 26) social anxiety groups. A face-evaluation paradigm was used to record both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses during fear generalization.ResultsAt the behavioral level, the high social anxiety group showed a broader fear generalization gradient. Both groups demonstrated higher unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings under negative versus positive evaluation conditions. This effect manifested differently between groups: in the high social anxiety group, it was specific to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) and generalization stimulus 4 (GS4), whereas in the low social anxiety group, it was observed for generalization stimulus 1 (GS1). At the neural level, SSVEP results revealed enhanced visual cortical activation (Oz, PO8) in the high social anxiety group across all stimuli. The PO7 electrode specifically reflected a differential modulation by evaluative valence between the groups; this adaptive modulation was evident in the low social anxiety group but absent in the high social anxiety group.ConclusionThis study reveals that social anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of early visual hypervigilance. Critically, we provide neurophysiological evidence that a core deficit underlying this condition is an impaired ability to utilize positive evaluation to down-regulate this hypervigilance. These results redefine our understanding of the cognitive-neural mechanisms of social anxiety, shifting the focus toward deficits in the neural processing of positive social information, and suggest that interventions should aim to restore the adaptive processing of positive social feedback.",

      "title": "Monotonicity in graph theoretic summaries of fMRI data acquired during human learning",
      "content": "IntroductionBehavioral performance during associative learning typically improves monotonically; performance on each successive iteration of the task is no worse (and typically better) than on the previous one. It is unclear whether connectomic measures of brain function (from fMRI data acquired during learning) also increase monotonically. We used a well-established associative learning paradigm to test for the possible co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and connectomics.MethodsfMRI data were summarized using two distinct connectomic (i.e., graph theoretic) measures: (a) Betweenness Centrality (of nodes) and (b) Average Shortest Path Length (i.e., a measure of network efficiency) across the graph. To broaden our study\u2019s breath, in addition to healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f39), we extended the analyses to data collected in schizophrenia patients (n\u202f=\u202f49). Past studies show that although patients show deficits in learning (lower learning capacity), behavior does typically display monotonicity.ResultsWe observed robust evidence for monotonic changes in behavior at the group level, and in most participants regardless of group. Evidence for monotonic changes in graph theoretic summaries of the co-acquired fMRI data was less widespread and was in general, more evident in group level summaries (regardless of group).DiscussionThis modest co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and fMRI-based connectomics re-emphasizes what has long been suspected: the relationship between overt measures of behavioral competence and the co-acquired imaging signals is complex. This may be because psychological events (whether in the healthy brain, or in clinical populations like schizophrenia) emerge not from local activity in circumscribed brain regions, but rather from widely distributed activity across the brain. While well-defined mathematical concepts like monotonicity can anchor attempts to co-observe properties of change in overt behavior, and underlying brain signals, we suggest that the search for such relationships will remain a challenge.",
