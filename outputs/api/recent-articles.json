      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "Sleep is essential for episodic memory consolidation, involving the reactivation of neural patterns during encoding and retrieval. This study examined how sleep duration influences encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) and memory performance across the adult lifespan. Fifty-five adults (18-79 years) participated in a seven-day protocol, combining actigraphy-based sleep monitoring with EEG and memory assessments during a paired associate learning task. Significant correlations between sleep duration and ERS were observed, with clusters showing positive and negative associations across brain regions. In match context trials, ERS in the left frontal region correlated with sleep duration, and age moderated these effects. In mismatch context trials, positive correlations were identified in the left posterior, left frontal, and right posterior regions. These results highlight the role of sleep in modulating neural reactivation patterns during memory retrieval and emphasize the influence of age. The study advances our understanding of how sleep variability impacts memory consolidation and provides a basis for exploring targeted sleep interventions.",

      "title": "Contextual unfamiliarity during drug intake induces AMPA receptors linked to relapse vulnerability",
      "content": "Relapse to drug use, even after years of successful rehabilitation, remains a challenge in treating substance use disorders. Drug-associated cues, stress, or the drug itself can trigger episodes of relapse. In rodent models of drug use disorders, cue-drug memories are enhanced through the expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons, emerging after prolonged withdrawal from some forms of drug-conditioned training. Inhibition or removal of these receptors dampens drug-seeking behavior. However, the specific contextual conditions that govern CP-AMPAR expression are unclear. To examine how environmental features influence drug memories, we compared three contextual settings in mice - the conditioned place preference (CPP), open-field (OF), and home-cage (HC) - using the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a model drug. Contrary to the HC condition, where CP-AMPARs were absent, synaptic CP-AMPAR expression was observed in the NAc shell of the CPP and OF groups, both of which involved immediate exposure to an unfamiliar context following drug administration. Moreover, the CPP and OF groups produced comparable increases in CP-AMPAR levels, and CPP mice presented heightened fentanyl-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that contextual unfamiliarity drove synaptic CP-AMPAR expression after drug conditioning, establishing neural substrates that mediate relapse vulnerability. The habituation or avoidance of contextual novelties during medical treatments with opioids may therefore represent a candidate therapeutic approach to reduce relapse risk by limiting the engagement of these critical cellular mechanisms.",

      "title": "Multiplex imaging combined to machine learning enable automated profiling of cortical malformations applications in tuberous sclerosis complex",
      "content": "Malformations of cortical development such as tuberous sclerosis complex arise within a heterogeneous cellular landscape that conventional histopathology only partially resolves. Here, we combined a 19-marker multiplex immunofluorescence panel with a machine learning-driven image analysis pipeline to map and quantify over 365 000 cells from paediatric surgical cortex, defining the single-cell architecture of TSC lesions. Microtubers were objectively delineated by vimentin and detected in all TSC samples but absent from non-dysplastic controls. Within these structures, balloon cells exhibiting strong pS6 activation occupied lesion cores and were confined to microtuber boundaries, whereas dysmorphic neurons were more diffusely distributed into adjacent cortex. The microtuber niche was dominated by astroglial remodeling: immature and reactive vimentin-positive astrocytes, including Lamp5-positive subsets, accumulated at and around lesion rims, while mature GFAP-positive astrocytes showed only modest changes. Distance-based spatial analyses revealed neuronal exclusion from microtuber centres with gradual recovery in surrounding tissue, indicating local network disruption. Unsupervised clustering and niche modelling recapitulated these spatial gradients, identifying a glial-dominated ecosystem that concentrates balloon cells, increases inter-neuronal distances, and reduces cell-cell interactions. Together, these data support a model in which cortical tubers arise through the coalescence of microtubers orchestrated by balloon cells and reactive gliosis during corticogenesis. Beyond elucidating disease architecture, our automated framework enables reproducible lesion detection, quantitative cell-state mapping, and spatial readouts applicable across malformations of cortical development.",

      "title": "How human aging disrupts the head direction network: evidence from VR experiments and mechanistic models",
      "content": "Navigational deficits during aging can severely limit mobility and reduce quality of life. While research on the underlying neural mechanisms has primarily focused on medial temporal lobe dysfunction, the head-direction (HD) system - a core component of the mammalian navigation circuit - remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. We established an immersive virtual reality paradigm that provides direct behavioral read-outs of HD signals. In addition, we developed a biologically inspired HD model, which accommodates noise sources that simulate age-related neural changes. Compared to younger adults, older participants exhibited larger angular errors, and a brief delay increased their heading uncertainty. In addition, our novel ring-attractor architecture shows that synaptic noise and small-scale neuronal loss replicate the magnitude and dynamics of the age-related deficits observed behaviorally. Together, these behavioral and computational findings provide the first evidence that aging compromises the fidelity and stability of the HD system. By pinpointing noise accumulation and neuron attrition as mechanistic contributors, our study significantly advances the understanding of spatial navigation deficits in old age, and it highlights novel targets for interventions aimed at preserving navigational abilities and quality of life.",

      "content": "Corollary discharge (CD) signals allow the brain to predict and suppress the sensory consequences of its own actions, providing stability to perception and thought. Disruption of these predictive mechanisms has long been hypothesized to contribute to the disorganization of experience in schizophrenia, yet direct circuit-level evidence has been lacking. Here, we show that ketamine, a dissociative N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, at subanesthetic doses, selectively disrupts CD signaling in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) - a region thought to be the seed of mental representations and one of the most affected areas in schizophrenia. We recorded activity from 1,342 neurons in LPFC areas 8a and 9/46 of macaques performing a visuospatial working-memory task in a virtual environment, before and after subanesthetic ketamine administration. Ketamine impaired performance and increased overall firing rates but markedly suppressed saccade-related responses carrying CD signals. This led to decreased discriminability of eye movement signals. This finding links two major ideas in neuroscience research: the role of disrupted glutamate signaling and the failure of the brain's predictive models. It provides evidence for how these mechanisms may interact in the prefrontal cortex to disturb the sense of reality.",

      "title": "Impaired synaptic inhibition and enhanced aversion encoding by lateral habenula neurons during \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol withdrawal.",
      "content": "The lateral habenula (LHb) integrates cortical and basal forebrain (BF) input to control monoaminergic outflow and is implicated in depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and aversion. Although cannabis withdrawal is associated with negative affect and heightened anxiety, LHb involvement is not established. Here, effects of withdrawal from the psychoactive cannabis constituent {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9-THC) on LHb neurons were assessed with photometric calcium measurement during fear conditioning and in vitro electrophysiology. LHb calcium signals were larger during footshock, and presentation of a tone paired with footshock in {Delta}9-THC withdrawn rats. Fear-induced freezing to the tone was also larger during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal. Electrophysiology revealed larger LHb excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratios during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, resulting from impaired synaptic GABA release. Moreover, GABA release via optogenetic activation of BF-LHb inputs was impaired during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, whereas no changes occurred at ventral tegmental area-LHb inputs. Recovery of BF-LHb GABA release and cannabinoid CB1 receptor desensitization were incomplete at 30 days of {Delta}9-THC withdrawal. The data show that LHb responsivity to primary aversive and conditioned stimuli are increased during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, and that this is likely mediated by altered E-I balance. We propose negative affect experienced during cannabis withdrawal is related to LHb hypersensitivity to aversive stimuli and this facilitates encoding of associated environmental cues.",
