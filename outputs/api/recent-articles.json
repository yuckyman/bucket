      "title": "Development and Kinematics Optimization of a Human-Compatible Rope-Driven Ankle Rehabilitation Robot Based on Foot-Ankle IFHA Identification",
      "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

      "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
      "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

      "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
      "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

      "title": "Multimodal imaging suggests potential immune-vascular contributions to altered regional brain perfusion and oxygen metabolism in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome",
      "content": "Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS) frequently presents with persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and emotional symptoms. Although structural brain changes remain subtle, growing evidence implicates functional and metabolic disruptions in ongoing symptomatology. We used multimodal MRI to investigate cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism in PCS and examined their associations with cognitive function and peripheral biomarkers. We enrolled 40 individuals with prior mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 20 with persistent fatigue and 20 recovered controls matched for age, sex, BMI, and acute COVID-19 severity. Participants underwent structural MRI, arterial spin labelling (ASL) to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), and asymmetric spin echo imaging to estimate oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). We assessed cognition using an online battery and measured serum levels of TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IFN-{gamma}, GFAP, and S100{beta}, alongside blood routine tests. We performed ANCOVAs on predefined regions of interest (hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], insula, amygdala, striatum), followed by Bayesian inference and exploratory whole-brain analyses. PCS participants showed increased CMRO2 in the hippocampus and decreased CMRO2 in the ACC. Subfield analysis revealed elevated OEF and CMRO2 across most hippocampal regions, excluding the entorhinal cortex. Whole-brain analyses identified increased perfusion in salience-related regions (insula, ACC, thalamus) and decreased perfusion in posterior cortical and cerebellar areas, in the absence of grey matter volume differences. Higher hippocampal metabolism positively correlated with cognitive performance, suggesting compensatory adaptation to sustain function. In contrast, lower ACC CMRO2 correlated with depressive symptoms, reduced motivation, and elevated TNF- and GFAP, consistent with neurovascular uncoupling possibly driven by immune-glial activation. These findings reveal distinct physiological disruptions in PCS, with potential implications for stratified, metabolism-focused interventions.",

      "title": "Microglia Piezo1 aggravates cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury by chemotactic recruitment of T lymphocytes",
      "content": "Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a complex pathophysiological process involving multiple mechanisms. Piezo1, a stretch-activated ion channel, has recently emerged as a potential regulator of cellular responses to ischemic conditions. However, its role in specific cells during ischemic events is not well elucidated. Here, we showed that after experimentally induced CIRI, Piezo1 channel was highly expressed in peri-infarct area, where is upregulated and activated mainly in microglia. Behavioral tests, and infarct volume measurements demonstrated that conditional Piezo1 deficient in microglia markedly ameliorated the neurological deficits and reduced the infarct volumes. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining showed decreased peripheral immune cells, especially T lymphocytes infiltration into the brain in microglia Piezo1 deficient mice after stroke. Multiplex chemokine immunoassay and T cell migration assays screened that Piezo1 deficient microglia blocked the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) release from astrocyte, which lead to the inhibited T cell recruitment in transwell co-cultured system. Furthermore, RNA-Sequencing analysis showed that defective Piezo1 in microglia lead to its polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to cerebral ischemia and reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}). Collectively, Piezo1 deficiency inhibited the secretion of TNF-? and IFN-? in microglia. The reduction of these inflammatory cytokines further blocked the CXCL10 release from astrocyte, and ultimately ameliorated the infiltration of peripheral T lymphocytes after stroke. Our results therefore highlight the critical role of Piezo1 in microglia-orchestrated neuroinflammation and suggest a potential means for reducing stroke-induced neurological injury.",

      "title": "Transplantation of Human IPSC-derived Microglia Ameliorates Neuropathology and Circuit Dysfunction in Progranulin-Deficient Mice",
      "content": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a major cause of early-onset neurodegeneration characterized by progressive behavioral, emotional, and cognitive decline. Progranulin haploinsufficiency, a leading genetic cause of familial FTD, disrupts lysosomal function, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and neuroimmune signaling across multiple cell types. Increasing evidence indicates that microglia are particularly sensitive to progranulin loss, exhibiting elevated complement activation that contributes to TDP-43 proteinopathy and neuronal dysfunction. Here, we investigate the biological role of restoring progranulin exclusively within microglia by transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) into progranulin (Grn)-deficient mice. We find that wild-type, but not Grn-deficient, human iMG restore brain-wide progranulin levels, normalize microglial transcriptional states, and ameliorate pathological, functional, and behavioral phenotypes associated with progranulin loss. Because microglia are the only source of progranulin in this system, these findings demonstrate that microglial progranulin is sufficient to restore key aspects of cellular, circuit, and behavioral homeostasis in a progranulin-deficient FTD model. More broadly, this work highlights a central, microglia-intrinsic role for progranulin in maintaining brain function and provides a framework for dissecting microglia-specific mechanisms across FTD and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "content": "REM sleep constitutes a critical window for memory consolidation, yet the brain circuits orchestrating this process remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify a lateral supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-medial septum (MS) projection as a REM sleep-specialized pathway essential for hippocampal memory consolidation. Fiber photometry and optrode recordings revealed that lateral SuM-MS projecting neurons were selectively active during REM sleep. REM-specific optogenetic silencing of this projection impaired consolidation of both social and contextual fear memories. Crucially, silencing of its downstream target, the MS-CA2 pathway, during REM sleep selectively disrupted social memory while sparing contextual fear memory. This functional dissection establishes a hypothalamo-septo-hippocampal circuit (lateral SuM-MS-CA2) dedicated to social memory processing, in parallel to the recently-described direct SuM-CA2 pathway. These results also position the SuM as a REM sleep-hub that routes information via parallel septal pathways to consolidate distinct memory modalities.",

      "title": "Molecular, cellular and network mapping of brain structural deviations in patients with Post-COVID19 syndrome",
      "content": "Post-COVID-19 syndrome encompasses persistent cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, profoundly affecting global quality of life. Clarifying the neurobiological basis of these symptoms is vital for effective therapeutic interventions. This study utilized normative modelling of brain structure (\"CentileBrain\") to quantify individualized deviations in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes among 20 patients experiencing persistent fatigue following mild COVID-19, compared to 20 matched healthy controls. Group-level analyses on deviation scores revealed subtle yet distinct regional alterations in cortical thickness, specifically decreased thickness within orbitofrontal cortices and increased thickness in occipital/sensory cortices. Although at the individual regional level, the proportion of patients exhibiting infranormal or supranormal thickness values was relatively low (<35%) and comparable to controls, deviations frequently clustered within structurally connected circuits, affecting up to 50% more of patients. Spatial analysis of regional cortical thickness alterations correlated significantly with the constitutive expression patterns of TMPRSS2, an essential protein facilitating SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Canonical correlation analyses further identified specific cell-type distributions and neuroreceptor densities predictive of regional thickness changes, highlighting neurons and molecular targets associated with serotoninergic, cannabinoid, cholinergic, and glutamatergic signalling pathways. Network-diffusion modelling constrained by a canonical structural connectome significantly outperformed null models based on permuted connectomes and Euclidean distance metrics, identifying posterior-parietal regions as probable initiation points (\"seeds\") for network-wide structural changes. Seed likelihood correlated positively with TMPRSS2 expression levels, suggesting that these posterior-parietal regions may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights a plausible mechanism where structural alterations could propagate through connected neural networks, although direct evidence of such propagation requires further investigation. These findings provide novel insights into potential mechanisms underlying neural circuit disruptions in post-COVID-19 fatigue and suggest avenues for therapeutic neuromodulation.",

      "title": "fNIRS Characterization of Temporal Potentiation During Optimized Nerve Stimulation",
      "content": "Restoring stable somatosensory feedback through transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) represents a significant challenge in neural engineering; however, the cortical dynamics underlying sensory habituation are not yet well characterized. This study utilizes a multi-method functional near-infrared spectroscopy framework to quantify the temporal evolution of cortical engagement during optimized TNS. It was hypothesized that stimulation parameters fundamentally constrain the spatiotemporal profile of the hemodynamic response function. A General Linear Model with temporal and dispersion derivatives was used to analyze hemodynamic responses in 10 participants across three phases: validation, duration optimization (2, 5, or 10 seconds), and sustained engagement (45 minutes). During the optimization phase, 5-second stimulation produced the highest canonical amplitude with optimal dispersion characteristics, while 10-second trains resulted in significant temporal delays. During the sustained phase, parametric modeling indicated no linear decay in cortical response. Instead, the cortex demonstrated temporal potentiation, characterized by a transition from sparse early-phase activation to widespread late-phase recruitment across the sensorimotor network. The left posterior parietal cortex (BA5) served as a continuous integration hub, whereas primary somatosensory regions exhibited dynamic late-onset engagement. These findings quantify a nonlinear adaptation mechanism whereby engineered temporal spacing prevents neural saturation. The observed intersubject heterogeneity highlights the necessity for adaptive, closed-loop TNS controllers guided by real-time hemodynamic biomarkers.",

      "title": "Non-invasive tracking of hippocampal theta oscillations",
      "content": "Hippocampal theta oscillations play a crucial role in the formation of episodic memories by binding multisensory information into coherent episodes. Brain stimulation studies suggest that memory performance can be modulated by targeting these oscillations, offering a potential way of treating memory disorders. However, to effectively engage these rhythms, precise knowledge about their presence, frequency, phase and location is required, which has been a challenge, particularly for non-invasive methods such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Here, we first asked if hippocampal signals are detectable in MEG recordings. Using simultaneous MEG-intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, we show that invasively recorded hippocampal activity is reflected in MEG sensor signals, demonstrating the feasibility of detecting deep-brain activity non-invasively. Building on this, we introduce a MEG-based analysis pipeline to track hippocampal theta frequency over time. Applied across three independent datasets, the pipeline captured characteristic hippocampal theta frequency patterns in both rodents and humans, and MEG-derived hippocampal frequencies were consistent with those observed simultaneously in intracranial EEG. These findings provide evidence that MEG can reliably track individual hippocampal oscillatory dynamics, paving the way for future non-invasive closed-loop interventions that adapt stimulation frequency and timing to ongoing oscillations.",

      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "Exploring the link between National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery performance and everyday functioning in mild cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: Neuropsychologists routinely use scores on traditional paper-and-pencil tests to assess capacity for independent functioning, with these assessments accounting for a moderate amount (20%\u201337%) of the variance in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) performance. The field is shifting toward incorporation of computerized neuropsychological assessments such as the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB). There have been no studies examining how the NIHTB-CB relates to IADL performance or whether it better predicts IADL performance compared to traditional methods. Method: Data from 74 participants in the Lithium as a Treatment to Prevent Impairment of Cognition in Elders were analyzed. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery, the NIHTB-CB, and measures of IADL capacity. Linear regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB performance predicted IADL performance. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine whether NIHTB-CB added incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance. Results: Select NIHTB-CB measures predicted IADL functioning as measured by a performance-based assessment of everyday functioning, but not self- or informant-reported everyday functioning. Of these subtests, two were found to add incremental validity to the prediction of IADL performance above and beyond their matched traditional measures, with effect sizes ranging from mild to moderate (<em>F</em>\u0394<em>R</em>\u00b2 = .045\u2013.077). Conclusions: We found performance on individual NIHTB-CB subtests predicted approximately the same amount of variance in IADL functioning as traditional tests, with only subtests assessing processing speed and executive functioning adding a mild to moderate amount of additional variance above matched measures. It remains important for clinicians to consider additional determinants of functioning when using computerized assessments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Familial longevity, educational attainment, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities are independently protective for cognitive aging, yet little is known about how these factors relate with one another. We explored the interplay between familial longevity, life exposures that confer cognitive resilience, and cognitive function in the Long Life Family Study. Method: A series of Bayesian hierarchical regression models was used to examine the associations among familial longevity, educational attainment, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and neuropsychological test performance in several cognitive domains in an ancillary observational study of Long Life Family Study family members and a referent cohort (<em>N</em> = 314, <em>M</em> = 75.7, <em>SD</em> = 14.6 years). Models were adjusted by age, sex, and upstream variables along the regression pathway (i.e., cognitive activity, education, and familial longevity), and incorporated a random intercept for family relatedness. Results: Referents had greater engagement in cognitive activities, and in turn, those with higher levels of education and cognitive activity exhibited better neuropsychological performance. Greater cognitive activity was specifically associated with better executive functioning, episodic memory, and language scores. Although Long Life Family Study family members engaged in cognitive activities less often than referents, they performed better on tests of episodic memory, and matched performance on tests of executive function, language, and visuoconstruction. Conclusions: These results suggest that familial longevity and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities represent two distinct pathways that contribute to preserved cognition in older adulthood, though these findings should be replicated in more diverse samples. Furthermore, these unique pathways differ across tests and cognitive domains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Remote assessment of episodic memory would be a cost-effective alternative to in-person visits for early detection of memory impairment related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but there is a need for test development and studies in population-based samples. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and correlates of a novel three-trial administration of 10-word list learning included in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in a population-based study of 65- to 96-year-old individuals. Method: A total of 800 participants completed telephone-administered word list learning task that yielded immediate and delayed recall measures. We compared these to corresponding measures from in-person neuropsychological assessment and tested differences between cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we studied the associations of age, sex, education, and genetic risk of AD with telephone-administered memory measures. Results: Telephone-administered three-trial word list learning task yielded normally distributed immediate and delayed recall measures that performed like corresponding measures from in-person assessment. Having cognitive impairment or AD\u2014but not genetic risk of AD\u2014were related to poorer memory performance. Younger age, being female, and having secondary education were related to better memory performance. Conclusion: Our study supports the validity of telephone-administered word list task with multiple learning trials. Remote assessment of memory can be used as an alternative to inviting people to in-person assessment and is also easily accessible for people living in remote areas and for those with physical disabilities or during restrictions related to in-person contact.

The present study sought to understand how informant-rated everyday cognitive abilities related to memory, language, spatial skills, planning, organization, and divided attention\u2014as measured by the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale\u2014change over time in a diverse sample of older adults. Method: Participants (<em>N</em> = 891) from the University of California Davis Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 76.1, <em>SD</em><sub>age</sub> = 7.4) were followed for an average of 4.4 years with annual ECog assessments. Multilevel beta regression was used to model ECog scores as a function of time, cognitive domain, diagnosis change, and\u2014in a neuroimaging subsample (<em>N</em> = 264)\u2014cross-sectional and longitudinal total gray matter and hippocampus volume. Results: ECog domains changed at different rates when modeled as a function of diagnosis change; differences in domain were most apparent in the stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-MCI and MCI-to-dementia conversion groups. By contrast, ECog domains changed at the same rate when modeled as a function of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal gray matter volume change, corresponding to other research suggesting that cognitive domains change at relatively uniform rates over time. In separate models, total gray matter and hippocampus atrophy were salient predictors of ECog score changes. At baseline, hippocampus volume was the strongest predictor of ECog intercepts. Conclusions: Although some caution is warranted interpreting score changes due to floor and ceiling effects, the ECog appears sensitive to underlying gray matter atrophy and change in clinical disease severity when used longitudinally.
