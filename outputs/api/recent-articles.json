      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

That's it.</p> <p>Fully typed, linted, and tested (by itself and pytest)!</p> <p>For those who do not know, you can test your docstrings with doctests/pytest, if they look like this:</p> <pre><code>def foo(x: int) -&gt; int: &quot;&quot;&quot;Example function. &gt;&gt;&gt; foo(2) 4 &quot;&quot;&quot; return x * 2 </code></pre> <p>This will fail if you wrote 3 instead of 4 for example.</p> <p>However it will only work for .py files, not for .pyi files (stubs)</p> <p>More infos here:<br /> <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html\">https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html</a><br /> <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/doctest.html\">https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/doctest.html</a></p> <h1>Usage</h1> <p>Run on all stubs in a directory -&gt;</p> <pre><code>uv run stubtester path/to/your/package </code></pre> <p>Run on a single stub file -&gt;</p> <pre><code>uv run stubtester path/to/file.pyi </code></pre> <p>Or programmatically -&gt;</p> <pre><code>from pathlib import Path import stubtester stubtester.run(Path(&quot;my_package&quot;)) </code></pre> <p>It will:</p> <ul> <li>Discover the stubs files</li> <li>Generate .py files in a temp directory with the docstrings extracted</li> <li>Run pytest --doctest on it</li> <li>Clean up the files once done</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Altough writing docstrings in stubs files is not considered idiomatic (see <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-in-stub/\">https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-in-stub/</a>), it's sometimes necessary if a lot of your code lives in Pyo3, cython, or if you are writing a third-party stubs package and want to ensure correctness.</p> <p>I currently use it in two of my repos for example:</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyopath\">https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyopath</a> (Pyo3 WIP reimplementation of pathlib)</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/cytoolz-stubs\">https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/cytoolz-stubs</a> (third party stubs package)</p> <p>There's still some improvements that could be done (delegating arguments to pytest for more custom uses cases, finding a solution between not having to manually manage the temp directory whilst still having convenient &quot;go to&quot; when an error occur), however the error handling of the code in itself is already solid IMO and I'm happy with it as it is right now.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I'm not aware of similar tools so far (otherwise I wouldn't have wrote it!).</p> <h1>Dependencies</h1> <p>- my library pyochain for iterations and error handling -&gt; <a href=\"https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain\">https://github.com/OutSquareCapital/pyochain</a><br /> - typer/rich for the CLI<br /> - pytest</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning-Fruit-1397\"> /u/Beginning-Fruit-1397 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2w477/stubtester_run_doctests_from_pyi_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2w477/stubtester_run_doctests_from_pyi_files/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>! I've been working on a focused library called <strong>calgebra</strong> that applies set operations to calendars.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>calgebra lets you compose calendar timelines using set operators: <code>|</code> (union), <code>&amp;</code> (intersection), <code>-</code> (difference), and <code>~</code> (complement). Queries are lazy\u2014you build expressions first, then execute via slicing.</p> <p><strong>Example \u2013 find when a team is free for a 2+ hour meeting:</strong></p> <p>```python from calgebra import day_of_week, time_of_day, hours, HOUR</p> <h1>Define business hours</h1> <p>weekend = day_of_week([&quot;saturday&quot;, &quot;sunday&quot;], tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;) weekdays = ~weekend business_hours = weekdays &amp; time_of_day(start=9<em>HOUR, duration=8</em>HOUR, tz=&quot;US/Pacific&quot;)</p> <h1>Team calendars (Google Calendar, .ics files, etc.)</h1> <p>team_busy = alice | bob | charlie</p> <h1>One expression to find available slots</h1> <p>free_slots = (business_hours - team_busy) &amp; (hours &gt;= 2) ```</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong> - Set operations on timelines (union, intersection, difference, complement) - Lazy composition \u2013 build complex queries, execute via slicing - Recurring patterns with RFC 5545 support - Filter by duration, metadata, or custom properties - Google Calendar read/write integration - iCalendar (.ics) import/export</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Developers building scheduling features, calendar integrations, or availability analysis. Also well-suited for AI/coding agents as the composable, type-hinted API works nicely as a tool.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Most calendar libraries focus on parsing (icalendar, ics.py) or API access (gcsa, google-api-python-client). calgebra is about <em>composing</em> calendars algebraically:</p> <ul> <li><strong>icalendar / ics.py</strong>: Parse .ics files \u2192 calgebra can <em>import</em> from these, then let you query and combine them</li> <li><strong>gcsa</strong>: Google Calendar CRUD \u2192 calgebra wraps gcsa and adds set operations on top</li> <li><strong>dateutil.rrule</strong>: Generate recurrences \u2192 calgebra uses this internally but exposes timelines you can intersect/subtract</li> </ul> <p>The closest analog is SQL for time ranges, but expressed as Python operators.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra\">https://github.com/ashenfad/calgebra</a> - Video of a calgebra enabled agent: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k\">https://youtu.be/10kG4tw0D4k</a></p> <p>Would love feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive-Glass-523\"> /u/Impressive-Glass-523 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q2gkde/i_built_calgebra_set_algebra_for_calendars_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
