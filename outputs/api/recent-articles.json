      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Distinct cellular processes drive motor skill learning in the human brain",
      "content": "Despite decades of research, the biological mechanisms by which motor skills consolidate in the human brain remain poorly understood. Diffusion MRI provides a unique opportunity to probe biological processes non-invasively, as water displacements occur on the micrometer scale. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), our team showed that motor sequence learning (MSL) induces microstructural changes in the hippocampus and key motor regions, suggesting that declarative and procedural systems may operate as part of the same network. Yet DTI cannot identify the cellular source of these changes, leaving open whether they reflect structural plasticity, remodeling of dendritic and astrocytic processes described in rodents, or transient homeostatic responses that accompany learning, neuronal and astrocytic swelling. Here, we combined ultra-high-gradient diffusion MRI with the compartment-based Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) model to disentangle the cellular basis of motor skill memory consolidation. DTI showed that MSL induced rapid microstructural changes in the hippocampus, precuneus, and motor regions, but only those in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) persisted overnight. SANDI revealed that DTI changes were driven by two distinct cellular processes: a transient enlargement of the cell soma across all regions consistent with a short-lived homeostatic response, and a sustained rise in cell-process density restricted to the precuneus and PPC, compatible with structural plasticity. By decomposing diffusion signals into their cellular sources, our work disambiguates transient and enduring processes, providing the first non-invasive evidence for the cellular basis of human motor memory consolidation and a framework for studying neuroplasticity in vivo.",

      "title": "Modular inhibitory coding in binary networks",
      "content": "We developed and characterized properties of new class of binary models where, as observed in biological networks, excitatory neurons are functionally separated from inhibitory units. New patterns, represented as activation and inactivation of binary units in excitatory layer, are stored in the network through recruitment and training of inhibitory units that are group into individual modules and interact with excitatory layer. We investigate the roles the two populations play in memory storage and show that inhibitory layer plays a critical role in memory storage and management and that capacity of this new type of network scales with number of inhibitory neurons. Further, we show that performance of the network is only gradually diminished when excitatory to excitatory connections are removed, but critically depends on inhibitory to excitatory connections. These results are in line with new experimental work showing that inhibitory interneurons are playing critical role in memory storage and recall in the brain networks and may also address why generally excitatory networks exhibit sparser reciprocal connectivity as compared to connections to/from inhibitory units. We further show advantages of so designed coding shame in terms of memory capacity, its expansion with progressive storage of new memories as well as network behavior for large memory loading.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
