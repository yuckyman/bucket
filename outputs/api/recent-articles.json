      "title": "Coordinated infraslow cortical oscillations of neuromodulators during NREM sleep",
      "content": "Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators regulate brain states through diverse mechanisms, yet how their activities are coordinated during sleep remains unresolved. Using in vivo fiber photometry in adult mice expressing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, combined with EEG/EMG recordings, we investigated the temporal organization of multiple neuromodulators during sleep in barrel cortex, with norepinephrine (NE) as a reference signal. All five neuromodulators examined, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and NE, exhibited synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations during NREM sleep. Optogenetic suppression of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons abolished NE oscillations and selectively reduced acetylcholine fluctuations in barrel cortex, whereas targeted inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons attenuated REM-associated acetylcholine elevations without disrupting NREM-related oscillations or NE dynamics. The synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations spanning multiple neuromodulators reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for organizing sleep architecture.",

      "title": "Constitutive DREADD signalling modulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell bioelectrical membrane properties and fate",
      "content": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are small cells in the central nervous system that proliferate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life, allowing for myelin plasticity and repair. G protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors can regulate OPC fate, but the role of individual G protein families is unclear. Here, we use chemogenetics to directly investigate the role of Gq and Gi proteins in OPC fate. We find that expressing the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) hM3Dq or hM4Di in OPCs without activating them with designer agonists induces constitutive G protein signalling, which alters bioelectrical membrane properties such as voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors in OPCs. Further, we find that hM3Dq or hM4Di expression alone modulates OPC fate, increasing or decreasing differentiation, respectively, suggesting that directly targeting G protein signalling can be used to bidirectionally regulate differentiation. Importantly, our data raise a note of caution regarding the use of DREADDs in both excitable and non-excitable small cells.",

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Mesa 3.4.0: Agent-based modeling; now with universal time tracking and improved reproducibility!",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! Mesa 3.4.0 is here with major improvements to time tracking, batch run reproducibility, and a strengthened deprecation policy. We've also migrated to our new mesa organization on GitHub and now require Python 3.12+. This release includes numerous visualization enhancements, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0\"><strong>https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0</strong></a></li> </ul> <h1>What's Agent-Based Modeling?</h1> <p>Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual &quot;agents&quot; (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.</p> <h1>What's Mesa?</h1> <p>Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.</p> <h1>What's new in Mesa 3.4.0?</h1> <h1>Universal simulation time with model.time</h1> <p>Mesa now provides a single source of truth for simulation time through the <code>model.time</code> attribute. Previously, time was fragmented across different components - simple models used <code>model.steps</code> as a proxy, while discrete event simulations stored time in <code>simulator.time</code>. Now all models have a consistent <code>model.time</code> attribute that automatically increments with each step and works seamlessly with discrete event simulators.</p> <p>It also allows us to simplify our data collection and experimentation control in future releases, and better integrate it with our full discrete-event simulation.</p> <h1>Improved batch run reproducibility</h1> <p>The <code>batch_run</code> function now offers explicit control over random seeds across replications through the new <code>rng</code> parameter. Previously, using <code>iterations</code> with a fixed seed caused all iterations to use identical seeds, producing duplicate results instead of independent replications. The new approach gives you complete control over reproducibility by accepting either a single seed value or an iterable of seed values.</p> <h1>Other improvements</h1> <p>This release includes significant visualization enhancements (support for <code>AgentPortrayalStyle</code> in Altair components, improved property layer styling), a strengthened deprecation policy with formal guarantees, removal of the experimental cell space module in favor of the stable <code>mesa.discrete_space</code> module, and numerous bug fixes.</p> <p>We welcome 10 new contributors to the Mesa project in this release! Thank you to everyone who contributed bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature enhancements.</p> <h1>Mesa 4</h1> <p>We're already planning the future with Mesa 4.0, and focusing on two key areas: <strong>Fundamentals</strong> (unified time and event scheduling, coherent spatial modeling, clean-sheet experimentation and data collection, stable visualization) and <strong>Extendability</strong> (powerful agent behavior frameworks, ML/RL/AI integration, and an extensible module system). We aim to make Mesa not just a toolkit but a comprehensive platform where researchers can model complex systems as naturally as they think about them.

As an input it accepts SMILES notation. Chemical syntax validity is enforced during training and inference using SELFIES encoding. I also made an optional GUI to interact with the model using NiceGUI.</p> <p>Currently, it might seem like a glorified substructure search, however it is able to generate molecules which may not actually exist (yet?) while respecting chemical syntax and including the input structure in the generated structure. I have listed some possible use-cases and further improvements in the github README.</p> <h1>Target audience</h1> <ul> <li>People who find it intriguing to generate random, cool, possibly unsynthesisable molecules.</li> <li>Chemists</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I have not found many projects which uses a GRU and have a GUI to interact with the model. Transformers, LSTM are likely better for such uses-cases but may require more data and computational resources, and many projects exist which have demonstrated their capabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thecrypticcode\"> /u/thecrypticcode </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[comments]</a></span>",
