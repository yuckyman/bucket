      "title": "Differential modulation of aversive signaling by expectation across the cingulate cortex",
      "content": "Pain-related aversion is an affective-motivational state driven by sensory experience that promotes learning and recruits widespread cortical networks, yet how distinct cingulate subregions contribute to its adaptive utility remains poorly understood. Here we used longitudinal one-photon calcium imaging in mice to compare dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) across repeated unsignaled foot-shocks and fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Both regions contained relatively stable ensembles that responded robustly to shocks, indicating shared encoding of acute nociceptive events. However, only the RSC flexibly reorganized its population activity when shocks were preceded by predictive cues. These anticipatory dynamics in the RSC predicted the rate of fear learning across individuals and subsequent extinction. By contrast, the ACC maintained shock-responsive ensembles with limited cue modulation. Instead, its dynamics encoded decisions to freeze, aligning with its role in encoding ongoing nociception and driving immediate defensive behavior. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which the ACC emphasizes ongoing nociceptive processing, while the RSC transforms sensory signals into predictive codes that shape learning and memory. This specialization highlights how distributed cortical computations cooperate to generate the adaptive value of aversion. More broadly, our findings suggest that these regions assume complementary roles to address immediate sensory-motivational responses while flexibly reconfiguring to support long-term behavioral adaptation.",

      "title": "PKM\u03b6-KIBRA interactions, molecular turnover, and memory",
      "content": "How can the molecules that strengthen synaptic connections maintain memory in the face of molecular turnover? Our previous work showed that persistent interaction between the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, KIBRA, and the autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is crucial for maintaining synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory for at least a month. This duration is longer than the lifespans of individual KIBRA and PKM{zeta} molecules. Biophysical modeling of the interaction suggests oligomers of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} dimers, but not individual dimers or monomers, can overcome molecular turnover by continually incorporating newly synthesized KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, replacing those that have degraded. Here we used AlphaFold 3 to predict the structures of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} heterodimers and heterohexamers and to examine the sites of action of two structurally distinct inhibitors of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interaction that disrupt established late-LTP and long-term memory. The structures predict that the peptide K-ZAP blocks formation of heterodimers, whereas the small molecule {zeta}-stat prevents PKM{zeta} of one heterodimer from binding a second KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, essential for forming larger oligomeric structures. We show that {zeta}-stat, like K-ZAP, disrupts 1-month-old spatial memory. Thus, continual formation of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} oligomers can be a core molecular mechanism driving the persistence of long-term memory in the face of molecular turnover.",

      "title": "The IKC-leptin axis functions as a molecular bridge between neurodevelopment and endocrine signaling",
      "content": "Kcnb1, a voltage-gated K+ channel widely expressed in brain, assembles with integrins to form integrin-K+ channel complexes (IKCs) in cortex and hypothalamus. Pathogenic KCNB1 variants cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), and Kcnb1-null (Null) mice reproduce core neurodevelopmental defects alongside chronic hypoleptinemia, suggesting a leptin-IKC signaling axis. We find that Kcnb1, integrins, and the leptin receptor (LepR) co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in cortical neurons. Perinatal leptin supplementation in Null mice improves cognition, corrects cortical anatomy, and restores neuronal migration, dendritic arborization, and synaptic functionality. In primary Null cortical neurons, leptin normalizes dendritic growth and actin remodeling via integrin-dependent mechanisms. By contrast, leptin has modest effects in WT animals and neurons; sensitivity is unmasked by pharmacological manipulation of integrins, and, strikingly, LepR blockade in the absence of exogenous leptin is sufficient to induce Null-like defects in WT neurons. These findings argue that hypoleptinemia alone does not drive the Null phenotype. Instead, they reveal a previously unrecognized, dual-mode model in which LepR signaling is regulated by both its ligand and IKCs. This conceptual advance links IKC-LepR coupling to neurodevelopment and DEE and pinpoints their interface as a tractable therapeutic target.",

      "title": "The individuality of single-frame functional brain connectivity",
      "content": "Converging evidence from studies on brain network fingerprinting and precision functional mapping suggest that brain networks are highly individualized in functionally meaningful ways. Concurrently with a growth in studies on this topic, there has been a rise in interest on dynamics (approximately second-to-second changes) in brain networks within scan sessions. While analyses of traditional static networks have increasingly grown towards emphasizing the importance of individual differences in brain network topology, studies of dynamic networks typically follow methodology that require brain states to be considered at a group level. In this work, we explore the extent to which brain states are shared across groups of people or unique to individuals using dynamic fingerprinting, an extension of existing fingerprinting methodology meant for dynamic networks. We estimate connectivity at individual volumes using phase coherence. We find that the identity of participants can be predicted with high accuracy based on single volumes given sufficient database scan data. We find that having more highly parcellated atlases facilitates individual identification. Finally, we find that tasks can be identified more readily within subjects than between subjects. We conclude that not only are trajectories between brain states unique to individuals (as previous work suggests), but also the instantaneous states that individuals inhabit are distinct. Further, the instantaneous neural correlates of a task appear to be more consistent within subjects than between subjects. This underlines the importance of considering individual variability in studies of brain network dynamics.",

      "content": "Emotions in speech are conveyed through both semantics and prosody--voice 'melody', yet how listeners integrate these cues in the brain remains unclear. We investigated non-literal forms of speech, such as irony and sarcasm, where understanding beyond literal meaning relies on the dynamic interplay between affective prosodic and semantic cues, alongside theory of mind (ToM). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants listened to short dialogues between two characters, which varied in prosody and semantics to convey either literal or non-literal meanings. Behaviorally, semantics and prosody interacted in shaping participants' evaluations, although the data suggest a prosody dominance effect. Non-literal speech engaged the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, temporal speech regions, and ToM areas, while integration-demanding tasks (e.g., irony, sarcasm, ToM) evoked stronger ToM-network activation than prosody or semantics tasks. Taken together, our data clarify the behavioral and neural underpinnings of the integration of prosody and semantics in non-literal speech and open new venues in this field.",
