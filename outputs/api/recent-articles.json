      "title": "Emerging technologies and neuroscience-based approaches in dyslexia: a narrative review toward integrative and personalized solutions",
      "content": "BackgroundDevelopmental dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs reading ability despite adequate intelligence and education, affecting up to 17% of children worldwide. Advances in neuroscience have revealed complex mechanisms involving phonological, visual, and temporal processing, with cross-linguistic variability. At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",

      "title": "Loss of Nocturnin increases neuronal viability in oxidative stress conditions",
      "content": "Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and is strongly associated with neuronal cell death. Nocturnin was identified as a NADP(H) phosphatase and key regulator of oxidative stress. NADPH serves as a crucial co-factor for enzymes which regenerate antioxidants, and downregulation of its levels increases sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined how the loss of Nocturnin impacts redox homeostasis and neuronal survival in Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression PD mouse model (DASYN53). Here we demonstrate that loss of Nocturnin increases CAD cell viability by increasing total glutathione levels, boosting metabolites involved in antioxidant defense, and reducing oxidative damage. Additionally, Nocturnin deletion in DASYN53 mice promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival. These findings suggest that the loss of Nocturnin protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant defense, which rescues neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

      "title": "Visionary Co-Driver: Enhancing Driver Perception of Potential Risks with LLM and HUD",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14233v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Drivers' perception of risky situations has always been a challenge in driving. Existing risk-detection methods excel at identifying collisions but face challenges in assessing the behavior of road users in non-collision situations. This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users. These risks are dynamically indicated on an adaptive heads-up display interface to enhance drivers' attention. A user study with 41 drivers confirms that Visionary Co-Driver improves drivers' risk perception and supports their recognition of roadside risks.",

      "title": "Algorithmic Management and the Future of Human Work: Implications for Autonomy, Collaboration, and Innovation",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14231v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the evolving impact of algorithmic management on human resource management (HRM) practices, with a focus on employee autonomy, procedural transparency, and the sociotechnical dynamics of performance evaluation. Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.",

      "title": "A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.",

      "title": "Final Happiness: What Intelligent User Interfaces Can Do for the lonely Dying",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14164v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores the design of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) to address the profound existential loneliness of terminally ill individuals. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in \"Thanatechnology,\" current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a \"tool for dying,\" but as a \"partner for living fully until the end\".",
