      "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

      "title": "DIME: Data-driven Importance MEtric Guides Localization of the Seizure Onset Zone from Intracranial EEG Data",
      "content": "Epilepsy affects over 50 million individuals, many of whom require surgical treatment that is dependent on accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Conventional SOZ biomarkers are based on strictly defined intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) phenomena and cannot benefit from increased datasets. The scarcity of SOZ-labeled iEEG data impedes biomarker development. We introduce the Data-driven Importance MEtric (DIME) to guide SOZ localization in an interpretable pipeline that improves with ictal-labeled iEEG data. We apply DIME to an open-source dataset (n=21; 13 successful; 8 failed) for SOZ localization and surgical outcome prediction. The highest DIME-ranked electrode belonged to the clinically annotated SOZ for 69.2% of patients with successful surgery (p<0.001). DIME scores were significantly higher in SOZ electrodes than nonSOZ electrodes in both successful and failed surgeries (p<0.001), though the DIME distribution for successful cases differed from failed cases (p=0.002). DIME predicted surgical outcome with 92.3% recall and 66.7% accuracy.",

      "content": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (eIF3d) is a noncanonical cap binding protein implicated in selective mRNA translation under stress conditions. Here, we investigate the contribution of eIF3d to pain processing using a heterozygous eIF3d knockout (eIF3d+/-) mouse model. We first validated this model, confirming substantial reductions in eIF3d mRNA and protein levels in dorsal root ganglia. Baseline assessments revealed no differences in mechanical, thermal, cold, or spontaneous pain behaviors between eIF3d+/- (HET) and eIF3d+/+ (WT) mice, indicating intact basal nociceptive function. In pain models involving peripheral inflammation and metabolic stress, including methylglyoxal injection, IL-6 administration and paw incision, HET mice displayed significantly reduced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. In contrast, HET mice exhibited increased second phase nocifensive behavior in the formalin test, possibly indicating enhanced central sensitization. Hyperalgesic priming was comparable between HET and WT mice following IL-6 exposure. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced mice were unaffected by eIF3d reduction. These findings demonstrate that eIF3d selectively modulates nociceptive plasticity under defined stress conditions and suggests a context dependent role in the regulation of inflammatory and central pain sensitization.",

      "title": "Vector coordinate transformation in the Drosophila navigation system",
      "content": "Animals' navigational behaviors rely on internal representations of space, yet how these representations guide behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we determined how neurons in the brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transform a world-centric (allocentric) reference frame to one that is body-centric (egocentric), which is essential for navigating to a goal. PFL1 neurons in the fly's central complex, the navigation center, have two dendrites; one of these receives input from neurons that encode a head direction vector, while the other receives input from neurons in a neuropil called the fan-shaped body (FB). Therefore, we investigated whether PFL1 neurons transform allocentric vectors to an egocentric reference frame. We developed a computational model that shows how PFL1 can transform an allocentric direction vector encoded by FB neurons to an egocentric reference frame by nonlinearly combining it with the head direction input. In tethered flying flies, we simultaneously recorded the head direction input to as well as the output of PFL1, which we used to constrain and fit our model. This allowed us to infer that PFL1 neurons receive a stored direction that persists across behavioral trials for the same fly but appears to be random across flies, fundamental characteristics of a goal. Our results describe how a population of neurons performs a coordinate transformation that can facilitate the pursuit of a goal, a fundamental computation for any neural system containing representations in multiple reference frames.",

      "title": "NAD+ hydrolase Sarm1 is a key driver of synapse degeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Synapse degeneration is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synapse loss has been known for decades as the strongest correlate with cognition and disease progression in AD patients, but the molecular mechanisms that drive synapse degeneration remain elusive. Here, we identify Sarm1, a new class of NAD+ hydrolase required for Wallerian degeneration of periphery nerves after injuries, as the key mediator of synaptic degeneration in AD brains. Sarm1 knockout largely reversed synapse loss, amyloid burden, and cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice. We found that Sarm1 is enriched in synaptic terminals and becomes activated in synaptic dystrophies adjacent to Abeta; plaques, leading to synapse degeneration and subsequent neuroinflammation. Sarm1 deletion in the AD mice prevented synaptic dystrophies and rescued short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Further, Sarm1 deletion protected synapses from C1q tagging and phagocytosis, and C1q-MERTK signaling in complement cascades was significantly reduced. The reduced synapse degeneration, in turn, broke the feed-forward loop of \"glia activation-neuroinflammation-Abeta deposition\". These data suggest that Sarm1 plays a key role in driving synapse degeneration in AD before C1q-tagging and phagocytic clearance, and targeting Sarm1 may offer a novel intervention to attenuate synapse degeneration and memory loss in AD.",

      "content": "Accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein at serine 129 is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its pathogenic role remains controversial. We conducted longitudinal studies using non-phosphorylatable S129A and phosphomimetic S129D -synuclein global knock-in mice. Unexpectedly, the S129A mice--rather than S129D mice--developed reproducible olfactory, motor, and cognitive deficits, dopaminergic dysfunction and neurodegeneration, -synuclein insolubility, and Lewy-like inclusions by 3 to 9 months, with progressive worsening up to 12 months of age. Spatial transcriptomics and electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial, synaptic, and protein ubiquitination abnormalities in the substantia nigra of S129A -synuclein mice. Viral vector-mediated nigral overexpression of S129D--synuclein or systemic administration of an anti--synuclein-aggregation drug partially alleviated the early neurological phenotypes of S129A mice. These results implicate non-phosphorylatable -synuclein as a direct pathogenic driver for PD.",

      "title": "Disentangling Brain-Psychopathology Associations: A Systematic Evaluation of Transdiagnostic Bifactor Models",
      "content": "Understanding the neurobiological basis of mental health disorders remains a central goal in psychiatry. However, identifying robust brain-psychopathology associations with neuroimaging has proven difficult, in part due to substantial heterogeneity within and comorbidity between diagnostic categories. Transdiagnostic bifactor models aim to characterise this structure by separating shared from unique symptom variance, yielding more reliable and potentially more accurate latent dimensions of psychopathology. However, the extent to which these behavioural models improve brain-psychopathology associations remains largely uncharacterised. Using two large developmental cohorts, we compared 11 previously published bifactor models applied to the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) to traditional CBCL summary scores. For both symptom-scoring approaches, we systematically evaluated their reliability and multivariate associations with whole-brain structure (MRI) and function (resting-state fMRI). We found no consistent evidence that bifactor-derived factor scores strengthened reliability or brain-psychopathology associations, relative to summary scores. Whole-brain predictive models revealed broadly distributed neural signatures that were highly similar between corresponding factor and summary score constructs, with general factors and total problems approaching numerical equivalence. Nevertheless, factor scores displayed more distinct neural signatures between general, internalising, and externalising dimensions than did summary scores. Together, these findings suggest that existing CBCL bifactor models of psychopathology do not systematically strengthen the predictive utility of psychiatric neuroimaging, possibly reflecting fundamental limits on the proportion of CBCL symptom variance captured by brain features. While bifactor models may aid in separating neural correlates across constructs, improving phenotypic assessment depth, rather than alternative phenotypic modelling, may provide more tangible improvements to association strength moving forward.",

      "title": "Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition for Cross-Bispectral Analysis of EEG Data",
      "content": "Cross-bispectral measures provide a rich description of interactions in EEG signals, but their third-order tensor structure poses substantial challenges for interpretation and dimensionality reduction. We introduce a low-rank tensor decomposition framework specifically designed for cross-bispectral EEG data. The model expresses the bispectrum as a product of a single spatial mixing matrix and a compact source-interaction tensor, yielding a structured and interpretable representation of the data. Unlike classical tensor decompositions such as Tucker and its special case PARAFAC, where either the core tensor is unconstrained or restricted to rank-one terms, our formulation incorporates a source-space interpretation directly through the tensor Qmnp, making the decomposition well suited for identifying dominant coupling components. After obtaining the low-rank representation, spatial demixing is performed using MOCA to derive clear and interpretable source maps. Through simulations, we show that the method consistently retrieves the dominant structure of the bispectrum across a wide range of conditions, including changes in SNR, dipole orientation, amplitude balance, and source complexity. Applied to resting-state EEG, the method produces anatomically plausible parietal generators associated with the strongest alpha-band bispectral interactions. Overall, the framework provides a principled and computationally efficient approach for reducing and interpreting cross-bispectral EEG data, offering source-level insights that are difficult to obtain using standard tensor factorization techniques.",

      "content": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration in optic neuropathies is often preceded by neuroinflammatory changes, yet the earliest in vivo indicators of this process remain poorly defined. Here, we identified vitreous hyperreflective foci (VHRFs) by visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) as an early inflammatory signature of RGC injury. Longitudinal vis-OCT imaging after optic nerve crush (ONC) revealed that VHRFs emerged as early as 6 hours post-injury and peaked before the significant RGC loss. Confocal analysis showed that these VHRFs corresponded to activated amoeboid microglia undergoing vertical migration from the outer to inner retina and horizontal movement toward the optic nerve head area. Similar amoeboid microglia were also observed in the anterior segment, suggesting a global ocular inflammatory response to the ONC injury. RNAscope in situ hybridization further demonstrated elevated IL-1{beta} expression in vitreous amoeboid microglia. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of IL-1 signaling with an IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced VHRFs, suppressed microglial migration, and delayed RGC loss. Taken together, our findings identify VHRFs as a previously unrecognized early danger signal for RGC degeneration and highlight IL-1-mediated inflammation as a tractable early therapeutic target for preventing RGC degeneration and vision loss.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.
