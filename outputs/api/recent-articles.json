      "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "content": "IntroductionSleep disorders represent the most prevalent psychiatric complication following stroke, seriously impacting patients' neurological recovery, functional prognosis, and quality of life. Music therapy, as a safe, cost-effective, and non-invasive intervention, is widely employed to ameliorate post-stroke sleep disorders. However, the precise mechanisms underlying music therapy's effects on post-stroke sleep disorders require further elucidation. This review aims to systematically examine the efficacy of music therapy for post-stroke sleep disorders and to elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms through which music may improve sleep outcomes in this population.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search across the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and VIP, with a search time frame ending in August 2025. Quality assessment was performed using the Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2).ResultsA total of 1,363 subjects from 14 original articles met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Each study has shown that music intervention can effectively improve the sleep status in patients with post-stroke sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Autonomic small fiber involvement in painful long COVID: a histological and clinical study",
      "content": "BackgroundDespite growing recognition of painful long COVID syndrome as a chronic neurological condition marked by pain and autonomic symptoms, the precise contribution of autonomic small fiber involvement is still not well characterized and understood. In this retrospective study, we aimed to identify autonomic small fiber involvement in patients with painful long COVID syndrome by analyzing skin biopsy data. We used nerve fiber density in the piloerector muscles (PMNFD) and sweat glands (SGNFD) as the primary histological outcomes of autonomic innervation.MethodsWe reviewed skin biopsy samples from 50 patients with painful long COVID syndrome and included 31 patients with available PMNFD and SGNFD data for analysis. PMNFD and SGNFD were compared with an age- and sex-matched healthy control group (n = 42). To evaluate whether autonomic involvement was independent of somatic nerve fiber reduction, a subgroup analysis was performed in patients with normal intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) (n = 23). Correlations between histological findings and autonomic symptoms, assessed with the COMPASS-31 questionnaire, were also analyzed.ResultsPiloerector muscle nerve fiber density and SGNFD were significantly reduced in patients with long COVID compared with controls, both in the full sample (p = 0.0135; p < 0.0001) and in the subgroup with normal IENFD (p = 0.0003; p = 0.0005). Neither PMNFD nor SGNFD correlated with COMPASS-31 scores (p = 0.27; p = 0.46) and no association with disease onset, duration and COVID-19 severity was found.ConclusionThese findings provide histological evidence that autonomic small fiber damage is a prominent and measurable feature of painful long COVID syndrome. Importantly, this pathology was also observed in patients with preserved IENFD, indicating that autonomic involvement may occur independently of somatic small fiber loss.",

      "title": "Rethinking ADHD as a neurointestinal syndrome: a gut\u2013brain\u2013parasite hypothesis",
      "content": "Neurodevelopmental conditions such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are usually framed as brain-based disorders driven by genetics and neurotransmitter imbalance. At the same time, converging evidence implicates the gut\u2013brain axis and intestinal immunity in shaping cognition and behavior. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, I propose that a subset of ADHD and related neurodivergent profiles can be usefully conceptualized as neurointestinal syndromes, emerging from co-evolutionary interactions between the gut microbiota, intestinal parasites, and host immunity. Drawing on data from ADHD, autism spectrum conditions, and migraine, I synthesize evidence for altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, and low-grade inflammation in neurodivergent individuals, and discuss how these changes may bias tryptophan metabolism, vagal signaling, and large-scale brain networks. I then explore a speculative evolutionary scenario in which recurrent helminth exposure, historically ubiquitous, acted as a long-term ecological force shaping gut architecture, immunoregulation, and stress responsivity. Chronic parasitic pressure, combined with microbial metabolites and epigenetic imprinting, may have contributed to the emergence of attentional profiles characterized by hypervigilance, novelty seeking, and rapid switching\u2014traits that could have been advantageous in ancestral, pathogen-rich environments but are often maladaptive in modern settings. This framework does not romanticize ADHD nor deny its frequent clinical burden. Rather, it reframes some ADHD phenotypes as possible mismatch syndromes involving the gut\u2013brain axis, generated when an evolutionarily tuned intestinal and immune architecture is placed in sanitized, post-industrial ecologies. Clinically, this perspective supports continued use of established CNS-targeted treatments while motivating complementary research into microbial, barrier, and vagal interventions as potential adjuncts for carefully defined ADHD subgroups.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the therapeutic mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) in a mouse model of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) induced by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).MethodsMotor functions were evaluated using open field test and pole tests. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the substantia nigra and striatum was detected by immunohistochemistry. Intestinal barrier integrity was assessed via immunofluorescence staining of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.ResultsEA treatment significantly improved motor deficits, restored TH expression in nigrostriatal regions, and enhanced colonic ZO-1 and Occludin levels. EA reversed MPTP-induced dysbiosis, notably normalizing the abundances of Dubosiella, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Desulfovibrio, Bacteroides, Allobaculum, and Parasutterella. Microbial co-occurrence network analysis revealed that EA simplified hyperconnected interactions and improved network stability.ConclusionEA treatment attenuated PD progression, which was associated with the remodeling of gut microbiota structure and restoration of microbial network stability. The concomitant protection of dopaminergic function suggests a potential link mediated by the gut\u2013brain axis.",

      "content": "IntroductionBeing able to recognize the emotions in others is fundamental to social interaction, yet the precise temporal dynamics by which the brain integrates contextual cues with facial expressions remain unclear. This study used behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how contextual congruency and emotional valence modulate facial emotion recognition in a neurotypical population.MethodsParticipants viewed emotional faces preceded by either congruent or incongruent bimodal cues, combining vocalizations and visual images.ResultsBehaviorally, participants responded faster and made fewer errors during congruent trials than in incongruent trials, indicating that context facilitates emotional processing. At the neural level, incongruent cues elicited a significantly larger P1 component, suggesting that the brain allocates increased early attentional resources to conflicting stimuli. Furthermore, the P3 component was significantly larger for negative stimuli compared to neutral ones, highlighting the role of emotional valence in later stages of cognitive processing.DiscussionTogether, these findings support a multi-stage model of emotional integration, where contextual incongruency impacts processing from early perceptual encoding to later cognitive evaluation. By integrating behavioral and neural evidence, this study clarifies the temporal course of contextual integration in multisensory emotion perception and provides new insights with implications for clinical and applied research.",

      "title": "Individualized cortico-basal ganglia network effective connectivity predicts outcomes of STN-DBS in patients with Parkinson's disease",
      "content": "BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, postoperative outcomes vary with no reliable predictive method.MethodsOur study involves 43 PD patients undergoing STN-DBS. Preoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imagings (rs-fMRI) were collected. The volume of tissue activated (VTA) was defined based on contact points and stimulation parameters. A model of the cortico-basal ganglia network was established using dynamic causal modeling. The correlation between the UPDRS-III and the network edges was determined through Pearson correlation analysis. Furthermore, a generalized linear model was employed to predict the post-DBS motor improvement.ResultsIndividual STN-VTA intersections were found to be important to UPDRS-III improvement induced by DBS (R = 0.59, P = 0.001). STN-VTA intersections were related to the thalamic-primary motor cortex (M1) (R = 0.47, P = 0.005), and M1-STN (R = 0.40, P = 0.006) coupling strength. The coupling strength of Thal-M1 (R = 0.442, P = 0.009) and M1-STN (R = 0.481 P = 0.004) resulted in DBS-induced movement enhancement, particularly rigidity. The strength of effective connections within the STN-Thal-M1 pathway was found to predict improvements in UPDRS-III scores (P = 0.003).ConclusionOur study confirmed the relationship between clinical improvements in STN-DBS and target location as well as the stimulation parameters. By constructing personalized cortical-basal ganglia network models based on target location as well as the stimulation parameters, we discovered that the effective connection strength in STN-THA-M1 can predict motor improvement in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS.",

      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "ssrJSON: faster than the fastest JSON, SIMD-accelerated CPython JSON with a json-compatible API",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>ssrJSON is a high-performance JSON encoder/decoder for CPython. It targets modern CPUs and uses SIMD heavily (SSE4.2/AVX2/AVX512 on x86-64, NEON on aarch64) to accelerate JSON encoding/decoding, including UTF-8 encoding.</p> <p>One common benchmarking pitfall in Python JSON libraries is accidentally benefiting from CPython <code>str</code> UTF-8 caching (and related effects), which can make repeated dumps/loads of the same objects look much faster than a real workload. ssrJSON tackles this head-on by making the caching behavior explicit and controllable, and by optimizing UTF-8 encoding itself. If you want the detailed background, here is a write-up: <a href=\"https://en.chr.fan/2026/01/07/python-json/\">Beware of Performance Pitfalls in Third-Party Python JSON Libraries</a>.</p> <p>Key highlights: - Performance focus: project benchmarks show ssrJSON is faster than or close to orjson across many cases, and substantially faster than the standard library <code>json</code> (reported ranges: <code>dumps</code> ~4x-27x, <code>loads</code> ~2x-8x on a modern x86-64 AVX2 setup). - Drop-in style API: <code>ssrjson.dumps</code>, <code>ssrjson.loads</code>, plus <code>dumps_to_bytes</code> for direct UTF-8 bytes output. - SIMD everywhere it matters: accelerates string handling, memory copy, JSON transcoding, and UTF-8 encoding. - Explicit control over CPython's UTF-8 cache for <code>str</code>: <code>write_utf8_cache</code> (global) and <code>is_write_cache</code> (per call) let you decide whether paying a potentially slower first <code>dumps_to_bytes</code> (and extra memory) is worth it to speed up subsequent <code>dumps_to_bytes</code> on the same <code>str</code>, and helps avoid misleading results from cache-warmed benchmarks. - Fast float formatting via Dragonbox: uses a modified Dragonbox-based approach for float-to-string conversion. - Practical decoder optimizations: adopts short-key caching ideas (similar to orjson) and leverages yyjson-derived logic for parts of decoding and numeric parsing.</p> <p>Install and minimal usage: <code>bash pip install ssrjson </code></p> <p>```python import ssrjson</p> <p>s = ssrjson.dumps({&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}) b = ssrjson.dumps_to_bytes({&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}) obj1 = ssrjson.loads(s) obj2 = ssrjson.loads(b) ```</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <ul> <li>People who need very fast JSON in CPython (especially tight loops, non-ASCII workloads, and direct UTF-8 bytes output).</li> <li>Users who want a mostly <code>json</code>-compatible API but are willing to accept some intentional gaps/behavior differences.</li> <li>Note: ssrJSON is beta and has some feature limitations; it is best suited for performance-driven use cases where you can validate compatibility for your specific inputs and requirements.</li> </ul> <p>Compatibility and limitations (worth knowing up front): - Aims to match <code>json</code> argument signatures, but some arguments are intentionally ignored by design; you can enable a global strict mode (<code>strict_argparse(True)</code>) to error on unsupported args. - CPython-only, 64-bit only: requires at least SSE4.2 on x86-64 (x86-64-v2) or aarch64; no 32-bit support. - Uses Clang for building from source due to vector extensions.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <ul> <li>Versus stdlib <code>json</code>: same general interface, but designed for much higher throughput using C and SIMD; benchmarks report large speedups for both <code>dumps</code> and <code>loads</code>.</li> <li>Versus orjson and other third-party libraries: ssrJSON is faster than or close to orjson on many benchmark cases, and it explicitly exposes and controls CPython <code>str</code> UTF-8 cache behavior to reduce surprises and avoid misleading results from cache-warmed benchmarks.</li> </ul> <p>If you care about JSON speed in tight loops, ssrJSON is an interesting new entrant.
