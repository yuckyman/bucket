      "title": "SynTEF1 restores the functional disease phenotype of SCA27B in an hiPSC-derived neuronal disease model",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia 27B (SCA27B), caused by a deep-intronic GAA-TTC repeat expansion in FGF14, has recently been identified as one of the most frequent genetic ataxias. Yet its underlying disease mechanism remains largely unknown, and disease-modifying treatments targeting upstream disease mechanisms are lacking. Here we hypothesized that (i) SCA27B is caused by transcriptional repression of FGF14, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission strength; (ii) which can be restored by a synthetic elongation transcription factor (Syn-TEF1). We assessed FGF14 mRNA levels by qPCR, and neuronal function by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in network and autaptic cultures of SCA27B patient iPSC-derived NGN2-neurons. Change in all read-outs was then assessed also upon Syn-TEF1 treatment. FGF14 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both heterozygous and biallelic SCA27B patient-derived neurons. This was associated with decreased neuronal excitability and decreased peak current density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Moreover, SCA27B neurons showed reduced synaptic transmission with decreased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes. Treatment with SynTEF1 restored FGF14 mRNA levels, thereby restoring neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These insights into SCA27B pathophysiology and its amelioration by SynTEF1 open new translational avenues for the development of disease-modifying gene-targeted therapies for SCA27B.",

      "title": "A scaffold attachment factor PHM-2 regulates synaptic transmission through SLO-2 potassium channel in C. elegans",
      "content": "Scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins are evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding proteins that are involved in multiple processes of gene expression. These proteins are broadly expressed with particular high expression observed in the nervous system. However, their physiological roles in neurons are largely unclear. Here we show that PHM-2, the sole SAFB ortholog in C. elegans, regulates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions through an effect on SLO-2 potassium channel. We found that phm-2 knockout suppresses a sluggish phenotype of worms expressing a hyperactive SLO-2 channel, greatly reduces SLO-2-mediated neuronal whole-cell currents, and enhances neuromuscular synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that PHM-2 genetically interacts with another DNA/RNA binding protein, HRPU-2/hnRNP U, to control SLO-2 expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These results reveal a novel function of a SAFB protein in regulating neuronal activity, and may help understand the physiological roles of SAFB proteins in the nervous system of other species.",

      "content": "<p>I built a small workspace lighting setup using LED strips and ended up learning more than I expected. On paper it was simple: stick a strip somewhere, add a diffuser, done. In practice, the stuff that mattered wasn\u2019t the spec sheet\u2014it was power delivery, optics, and human perception.<p>A few notes that surprised me:<p>Power planning > \u201cjust buy a bigger PSU.\u201d Long runs behave like distributed loads. Voltage drop shows up as uneven brightness, and on RGB/RGBW it can show up as color shift (\u201cwhite\u201d gets warmer at the far end). The fix isn\u2019t only wattage\u2014it\u2019s where you feed power, wire gauge, and connector losses.<p>Diffusion is not cosmetic. Without enough distance or diffusion, you get hotspots and glare. A cheap milky diffuser in an aluminum channel gets you most of the way there, but what helped the most was increasing LED-to-diffuser distance (depth of the channel) rather than chasing \u201cpremium\u201d diffusers.<p>Indirect beats direct for comfort. Bouncing light off a wall/desk surface looked dimmer on paper but felt more usable and less fatiguing. It also hid the fact that LEDs are point sources.<p>Signal integrity is a separate problem (for addressable). A lot of \u201cflicker\u201d is actually data/ground/reference issues, not power. Short data lines, solid ground, and sometimes level shifting helped more than swapping power supplies.<p>Questions for folks who\u2019ve done larger installs (10\u201350m) or more \u201cproduction\u201d setups:<p>Do you design power delivery first or physical layout first?<p>Any favorite diffuser/channel profiles that minimize hotspots without killing too much output?<p>For long addressable runs, what\u2019s your go-to strategy for signal conditioning (buffers, differential, etc.)?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46390875\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46390875</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "A Theory of Thalamocortical Loops in Evidence Accumulation and Decision-Making",
      "content": "A prominent property of the neocortex is that it forms reciprocal excitatory loops with the thalamus. Here, we propose a function for the loops between layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons in the cortex and matrix-type relay cells in the thalamus, which is based on known anatomy and biophysics. This pathway forms an amplifier circuit with a gain less than unity in the resting condition. However, descending cortical input to apical tufts of L5 neurons can raise the gain of these neurons, boosting the thalamocortical loop into either an integrating or an amplifying regime. Multiple thalamocortical loops compete via lateral inhibition in the thalamus, resulting in a winner-take-all global dynamic among the motor commands encoded by each loop. When L5 neurons are driven by sensory inputs, the integration regime closely resembles the drift-diffusion model of decision-making. We explore basic relationships among parameters of this model and compare broadly against neurophysiological data.",

      "title": "An auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans sensitive to fast temporal cues",
      "content": "Rapid threat processing is crucial for survival. In vision, neural models of emotion propose the existence of direct pathways, or \"low roads\", from visual thalamus to the amygdala, which may rely on magnocellular inputs and thereby enable rapid processing of threat signals. In audition, evidence from non-human animals points to the existence of a similar fast direct pathway, but its presence in humans remains unknown. Building on animal evidence that high-rate amplitude-modulated (highAM) sounds preferentially engage magnocellular processing, we used behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging measures to search for an auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans responsive to magnocellular-associated features. Specifically, we tested whether highAM threat cues elicit rapid affective responses, and whether highAM threat processing aligns with structural thalamo-amygdala connectivity. We recorded electroencephalography and pupillometry from participants while they detected voices during fear conditioning. Emotional voices presented at highAM rates, as opposed to lowAM, elicited threat-related responses during the earliest post-stimulus window. A further study combining functional and diffusion-weighted imaging revealed that selective amygdala responses to highAM threatening voices were functionally associated with individual fiber density of an auditory thalamo-amygdala pathway. These results provide convergent functional and anatomical evidence supporting a subcortical pathway for auditory threat processing, consistent with evolutionarily conserved emotional systems.",

      "title": "Conditional-longitudinal brain growth charts detect MRI changes with birth weight and psychopathology",
      "content": "Key Points: Question: How do differences in brain maturation trajectories, quantified by novel conditional-longitudinal models, relate to perinatal factors and mental health in adolescence? Findings: In this longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, conditional-longitudinal normative models revealed that trajectories of brain maturation in adolescence are associated with birth weight, and with longitudinal changes in mental health. Meaning: Conditional-longitudinal models detect inter-individual variability in brain maturation, which is related to both perinatal factors and concurrent changes in psychopathology. Importance: Brain maturation varies between individuals, particularly during dynamic developmental periods like adolescence. Directly assessing differences in longitudinal trajectories can reveal deviations from normative patterns. Objective: We present novel conditional-longitudinal normative models that characterize variability in brain maturation. We utilize these models to examine whether differences in longitudinal trajectories are associated with birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and longitudinal psychopathology scores derived from behavioral assessments. Design: Cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal normative models were developed for brain volumes derived from the first two neuroimaging timepoints from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Conditional-longitudinal models index an individual's expected brain volume at follow-up, conditioned on their baseline measurement. Models were fit with split-half cross-validation on demographically matched samples. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site, population-based, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: Participants were excluded based on imaging quality flags and missing data, leaving 10,830 at baseline and 7,262 at follow-up. Exposures: BW and GA were derived from parent-report questionnaires. General psychopathology scores were calculated using a bifactor model. Main Outcomes and Measures: We calculated cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal centiles, respectively quantifying individual deviations in size and change between timepoints. Sensitivity analyses included covariates for parental income and education as well as current weight and height. Results: The sample was 10,830 at baseline (48.2% F, age 9-10y) and 7,262 at follow-up (46.6% F, age 11-13y). Conditional-longitudinal centiles were sensitive to individual differences in brain change between timepoints. Lower BW was associated with lower conditional-longitudinal centiles, suggesting larger decreases in brain volumes over time (27 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.08). Lower conditional-longitudinal centiles were associated with greater increases in psychopathology scores, suggesting with increased psychopathology brain volumes show greater decrease (37 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.06). Notably, changes in psychopathology were not related to brain size at either timepoint, indexed by cross-sectional centiles. Conclusions and Relevance: Models that capture individual-level deviations from expected growth trajectories, rather than static positions on a growth curve, are particularly informative for assessing developmental change. Novel conditional-longitudinal models address this gap in lifespan brain imaging. Using this framework, we demonstrate robust associations between individual trajectory deviations, perinatal adversity, and longitudinally assessed mental health symptoms. Conditional-longitudinal models hold promise for applications across psychiatric neuroscience, from development to aging.",
