      "title": "Numerical Variability of functional MRI Graph Measures",
      "content": "Network neuroscience provides a powerful framework for studying the mechanisms underlying brain-related diseases. As analyses become increasingly computational, ensuring their numerical reliability has become a critical challenge. Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes. NPVR values varied across brain regions, thresholding choices, and confound regression strategies. These findings highlight numerical variability as an important factor in functional network studies, particularly when examining subtle effects or working with small sample sizes.",

      "title": "Cellular- and systems-level profiling of amyloid-beta effects on circadian timing",
      "content": "Disruption of the circadian timing system has been reported in the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD) and is a well-characterized component of mid- and late-stage AD. Given the distributed nature of the circadian timing system, with a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks throughout the brain, understanding how AD affects this system has been challenging. To investigate how AD may disrupt circadian physiology, we focused on the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to familial early-onset AD. Using the 5xFAD mouse model and ex vivo single-cell profiling, we examined how amyloid-beta influences clock timing in both SCN neurons and hippocampal neuronal populations. Circadian profiling of 5xFAD mice (4- and 8-months-old) showed only modest changes in key clock timing properties, including a shortening of the SCN rhythm. Interestingly, the mice showed enhanced rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light cycle, suggesting that elevated amyloid-beta levels increase the sensitivity of the SCN clock to light. Further, using both in vitro SCN slice explant and dispersed SCN culture models, the exogenous administration of oligomerized amyloid-beta had no significant effect on inherent clock timing capacity. In contrast, the timing properties of cultured hippocampal neurons showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to amyloid-beta. This included an elevated mesor and an increased rhythm amplitude. These findings reveal a divergence in amyloid-beta sensitivity between the central SCN clock and peripheral oscillators. This raises the possibility that circadian disruptions in AD may stem from both the destabilization and decoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central timing properties of the SCN.",

      "title": "Deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning",
      "content": "Understanding how cognition shapes behavior across contexts remains a fundamental challenge for many disciplines. In particular, for the optimism heuristic--i.e., the tendency to overweight positive (relative to negative) information--knowledge remains fragmented, with models developed in specific domains in isolation. Here, we present a unifying computational framework by deriving the deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach discretizes reward distributions through a finite set of neurons, consistent with recent empirical findings on distributional coding in the brain. We validate our framework by reproducing established results across three iconic domains spanning individual exploration versus exploitation, social coordination, and risky choice. Beyond validation, we uncover novel interactions among optimism, reward discretization, and temporal discounting. Specifically, we identify conditions under which choice hysteresis and path-dependent strategies emerge, suggesting that perseveration results from neural reward discretization rather than constituting an independent heuristic. We further reveal \"individual dilemmas\": circumstances where agents gravitate toward suboptimal yet stable strategies, offering a mechanistic explanation for incoherent choice patterns. Our framework bridges neuroscience, psychology, and collective behavior, enabling empirically testable hypotheses about how cognitive biases propagate from individual cognition to social outcomes in complex environments.",

      "title": "Canonical Wnt signaling controls the fate and plasticity of NG2 glia in the healthy and ischemic adult mouse cortex",
      "content": "NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), exhibit unexpected plasticity in the adult brain after injury, yet the molecular cues guiding their fate remain poorly defined. Wnt signaling contributes to tissue responses following ischemic stroke, but its precise role in post-injury glial remodeling is not fully understood. Here, we define how Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling shapes NG2 glial behavior after focal cerebral ischemia. Using genetic mouse models enabling cell-specific Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological recording, we disclosed a central role for Wnt signaling in post-injury fate specification. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the oligodendroglial lineage, including a subset with an astrocyte-like transcriptional profile. Wnt signaling strongly influenced the balance between OPC proliferation and differentiation: pathway hyperactivation impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and expanded astrocyte-like NG2-derived cells, likely through concomitant activation of the Notch pathway. Remarkably, Wnt hyperactivation also induced the appearance of cholinergic neuron-like cells derived from NG2-expressing cells exclusively in the somatosensory cortex; these cells generated action potentials and exhibited sodium conductance characteristic of functional neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that NG2 glia undergo distinct fate transitions after stroke and that their lineage plasticity is highly sensitive to Wnt pathway dynamics. Targeted fine-tuning of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may enable directed redirection of NG2 glia toward specific reparative outcomes, including neuronal reprogramming, in the injured adult brain.",

      "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Willed Attention Control",
      "content": "Cueing paradigms are commonly used to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention control. In these paradigms, each trial starts with an external cue, which instructs the subject to pay covert attention to a spatial location in anticipation of an impending stimulus (instructed attention). Recent work has introduced a new type of cue which prompts the subject to spontaneously decide which spatial location to attend (willed attention). We studied the neural mechanisms of willed attention control by analyzing fMRI and EEG data recorded at two institutions (UF and UC Davis) using the same willed attention paradigm. The findings include: (1) both instructional cues and the choice cue activated the DAN, (2) the choice cue additionally activated a frontoparietal decision network consisting of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) the decision about where to attend can be decoded in frontoparietal decision network in choice trials but not in instructional trials, and (4) EEG alpha oscillation patterns immediately preceding the choice cue, but not the instructional cues, predicted the postcue direction of attention and the frontoparietal decision network activity. Based on these findings we proposed a model of willed attention control revealing how the direction of visual spatial attention was decided upon in the absence of external instructions.",

      "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of experimental pain on rat grimace scale scores",
      "content": "The rat grimace scale (RGS) purports to assess behavioural responses related to pain by assessing four facial expressions. To understand how experimental pain affects RGS scores, we conducted a systematic review of studies which reported outcomes using this scale (CRD42022292189). Systematic searches were conducted on 3 databases in January 2022. RGS studies that assessed the effects of disease models relating to pain were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using a modified version of the CAMARADES reporting checklist and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A standardised mean difference effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Fifty-four studies were included, in which 15 disease model classes and 16 classes of pharmacological interventions were identified. RGS scores were increased in disease models hypothesised to be associated with persistent pain (SMD = -4.44 [95%CI -6.25 to -2.63]) and this response was attenuated by analgesic drugs (SMD = 1.97 [95%CI 1.25 to 2.69]). Post-surgical models (39% of experiments) and opioids (30% of experiments) were the most commonly reported. We could not ascertain the sources of heterogeneity due to insufficient data. Most studies were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting quality. The relationship between RGS scores and mechanically evoked limb withdrawal was inconsistent. These findings indicate emerging evidence to support the use of RGS in persistent pain research, but additional research is needed to strengthen these findings. Future studies could benefit from using sex-balanced animal populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. To enhance the impact and reproducibility of their findings, studies should prioritise improvements in reporting quality.",

      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "A high-content imaging workflow to screen for molecules that reduce cellular uptake of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils",
      "content": "A classical pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the formation of protein-rich aggregates and inclusions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.",

      "title": "10.5 Tesla High-Resolution Macaque Brain MRI for Connectivity Studies",
      "content": "Mapping brain connectivity in primates remains a major challenge due to difficulties in resolving microscopic white matter architecture, while maintaining whole-brain coverage. Increasing imaging spatial resolution is key for disambiguating fiber configurations within smaller anatomical volumes. Here, we present developments that allow high-resolution diffusion MRI of the macaque brain, both in vivo and ex vivo, using one of the world's highest-field human MRI scanners operating at 10.5 Tesla. Our approach achieves data of highest reported resolutions for this field strength and scanner type, (750 m)3 in vivo and (400 m)3 ex vivo, with diffusion weighting up to b = 6000 s/mm2. We detail methodological advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and whole-brain tractography that overcome critical challenges associated with ultra-high-field imaging. This work establishes a new benchmark for high-resolution neuroimaging at 10.5T, paving the way for comparable human studies and enabling analyses of brain connectivity across species and tissue states at unprecedented detail. The dataset, along with all processing pipelines, containerised workflows, and reusable web services, is openly shared to support reproducibility and future integration with microscopy for studying white matter microstructure and connections at the mesoscale.",

      "title": "Associations between amygdala connectivity and experienced discrimination in children",
      "content": "Discrimination is a chronic stressor linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding associations between early discrimination and the brain in childhood may help identify mechanisms through which discrimination impacts future health. Data from 4512 children (ages 9-11) and a subsample of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC; N = 1567) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) was used to create linear mixed-effects models that evaluated associations between Perceived Discrimination (PD) and amygdala resting-state fMRI connectivity (AC) to the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and thalamus. PD was measured using the youth self-reported PD Scale. Results indicated that greater PD significantly predicted greater AC to the right thalamus in our full sample. In secondary analyses, environmental and behavioral factors were evaluated as potential moderators for associations significant at least at a trend level in both our full sample and BIPOC subsample. In our BIPOC subsample, traumatic events experienced (TE) moderated the relationship between PD and AC to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; SN), such that greater TE predicted stronger positive associations between PD and this connection. Results suggest PD impacts neural connections in early life, highlighting the need to consider the impact of discrimination on risk for psychopathology.",

      "title": "PATZ1 remodels the nucleosome landscape to promote chromatin accessibility in injured neurons",
      "content": "Adult central nervous system neurons fail to regenerate after injury, in part due to epigenetic constraints that maintain a growth-restrictive chromatin state. We previously showed that the transcription factor PATZ1 reprograms chromatin accessibility in injured corticospinal neurons to promote axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we use nucleosome-resolution profiling to reveal that PATZ1 induces widespread nucleosome eviction at regeneration-associated gene loci. PATZ1 treatment dramatically reduces both nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness, indicating active chromatin remodeling rather than passive destabilization. This remodeling occurs preferentially at distal regulatory elements, where PATZ1 drives a greater than 3-fold expansion of H3K27ac-marked active enhancers. Nucleosome eviction at these sites precedes enhancer activation, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that targeted nucleosome eviction at enhancers underlies PATZ1-mediated chromatin reorganization, providing mechanistic insight into how epigenetic barriers to CNS regeneration can be overcome.",

      "content": "Senescent microglia develop during aging and Alzheimer disease (AD), driving chronic neuroinflammation. Here we hypothesized that the previously observed disease-modifying effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade occur through clearance of senescent microglia. Using CyTOF, we found that a single systemic anti-PD-L1 injection leads to rapid elimination of senescent microglia in 5xFAD and aged wild-type mice, independently of Fc effector function, while increasing homeostatic microglia. These findings suggest that immune rejuvenation via PD-L1 blockade promotes disease modification in AD through senescent-microglial elimination.",

      "title": "Open-access template and database approaches for pseudo-CT generation in brain PET/MRI attenuation correction",
      "content": "Positron emission tomography (PET) provides high-sensitivity molecular information in neuroimaging. However, its quantitative accuracy critically depends on attenuation correction (AC). Unlike PET/CT, hybrid PET/MRI systems cannot directly measure photon attenuation, necessitating alternative AC strategies. While several MRI-based AC tools exist, they often raise concerns regarding data privacy, long-term accessibility and reproducibility. We present an open-access framework for PET AC using pseudo-CT (pCT) methods. A database of 60 paired MRI-CT scans was curated and normalized to stereotactic MNI space. Three established pCT approaches (Boston, MaxProb, UCL) were adapted to enable their use with the normalized database. Method performance was assessed by comparison with a CT-based AC reference in an independent validation sample of 28 subjects, using the Jaccard index and [11C]DASB PET-derived serotonin transporter quantification as evaluation metrics. Boston and MaxProb demonstrated consistent performance across database subsets, while the UCL achieved the closest agreement with CT-derived AC and yielded the lowest quantification error (mean relative error <0.5%). This work demonstrates the feasibility of different pCT approaches using a database in MNI space thereby introducing an openly available reference database to support fast, reproducible and continued integration of MRI-based AC into PET reconstruction pipelines.",
