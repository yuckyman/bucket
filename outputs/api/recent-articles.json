      "title": "The first comprehensive case study of early-emerging prosopometamorphopsia",
      "content": "Prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized by facial distortions. This report presents the first thorough study of a case of PMO that emerged early in life. Zed, age 15 at the time of testing, has experienced lifelong, dynamic facial distortions in which features move, droop, disappear, expand, shrink, and rotate. He also experiences identity misrecognitions, in which he perceives familiar faces as strangers and vice versa (e.g., seeing his grandfather when viewing a young woman). Behavioral assessments indicate that Zed's distortions occur across viewpoints, visual field positions, picture-plane orientations, and visual angles. Neuropsychological testing revealed face identity recognition deficits, yet, despite his facial distortions, Zed can make accurate fine-grained perceptual judgments about facial age and sex. Structural MRI showed no lesions, but face-selectivity in two right posterior face-selective areas was reduced, and diffusion tensor imaging revealed lower white matter integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Zed's case offers new insights into early-emerging PMO, its manifestations, co-occurrence with other face-processing disorders, and underlying neural correlates.",

      "title": "Reverberation exacerbates effects of interruption on auditory spatial selective attention",
      "content": "Everyday listening requires focusing on one talker while ignoring competing sounds, a process challenged by reverberation and unexpected distractions. Here, we asked whether reverberation decreases effects of distractions by reducing the salience of new onsets, or compounds disruption by increasing task difficulty. Across five online experiments, participants recalled spatialized syllable streams presented with or without interrupters under pseudo-anechoic and reverberant conditions. Interrupters consistently impaired recall, especially the syllables following the interrupter. For the syllable immediately after the interruption, this effect was larger in reverberation than in anechoic conditions. These results demonstrate that distractions are especially disruptive in reverberant settings.",

      "title": "Multi-timescale Rhythmic Dynamics in Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Neurons",
      "content": "Neural circuits involved in sensory control must integrate fast, reflexive responses with slower, state-dependent modulation. This coordination is especially critical in the pain system, where rapid withdrawal must be balanced against slower adjustments in nociceptive sensitivity that reflect arousal, physiology, and internal state. We hypothesized that neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), the principal brainstem node for descending pain control, operate across multiple temporal scales, combining fast stimulus-evoked responses with slower intrinsic dynamics. Using single-unit recordings from identified RVM ON-, OFF-, and NEUTRAL-cells and probabilistic modeling, we find that ON- and OFF-cells exhibit multi-phase population responses characterized by rapid activation and prolonged recovery dynamics lasting tens of seconds. In the absence of stimulation, the same neurons display coherent, quasi-periodic oscillations on the order of minutes, captured by Gaussian process models as predictable, low-frequency fluctuations. These rhythmic dynamics were specific to ON- and OFF-cells and occasionally coherent with autonomic parameters, suggesting coupling between nociceptive and homeostatic control loops. Together, these results identify a multi-timescale organizational principle within descending brainstem circuits, in which fast, reflex-related and slow, rhythmic processes jointly structure sensory modulation and internal state control.",

      "title": "Sleep-modulated disinhibition enables replay for memory consolidation, accelerated by ripples",
      "content": "Memory consolidation involves elusive neural mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysically detailed model of the entorhinal-hippocampal-cortical network to reveal that disinhibition drives synaptic and systems consolidation. Transitioning to slow-wave sleep via neuromodulatory dampening of inhibition generates up-down states and spontaneous, time-compressed replays of spatial sequences encoded with theta-phase precession. Lateral inhibition levels unify physiological and pathological ripple diversity. Cortical disinhibition enables memory transfer from hippocampus. Weakened afferent CA1 synapses eliminate ripples but spare replays, proposing strategies to mitigate ripple disruptions. Replays sustain systems consolidation even without ripples, albeit slower; excessive weakening halts it, rescuable by enhanced hippocampal-to-cortical connectivity. Inducing disinhibition during wakefulness--mimicking medial-entorhinal-cortex-input-dependent quiet wakefulness replay--activates these processes, underscoring disinhibition's state-agnostic role. These insights elucidate disinhibition's centrality in engraining memories and fostering hippocampal independence, reconciling empirical observations, yielding testable predictions, and identifying therapeutic avenues for memory disorders.",

      "title": "Temporal contrast enhancement generalizes across pain and auditory modalities",
      "content": "The human brain continuously processes sensory inputs whose perceptual impact depends on stimulus intensity, salience, and context. Temporal filtering shapes this processing by dynamically modulating neural responses according to stimulus repetition, temporal structure, and predictive contingencies. Higher-order percepts such as pain are likewise a subject to temporal filtering, as exemplified by temporal contrast enhancement (TCE), a stimulation paradigm eliciting pain inhibition. However, given the prevalence of filtering mechanisms across sensory domains, it remains unclear whether TCE is specific to pain or represents a supramodal filtering mechanism. Here, we contrasted behavioral and neurophysiological responses, including electroencephalography and pupillometry, in a TCE paradigm for painful heat versus uncomfortable auditory stimulation. We sought to establish whether TCE generalizes across modalities and bases on similar or distinct underlying neurophysiological processes. Human participants took part in either a purely behavioral investigation (n = 33) or in a neurophysiological and behavioral investigation (n = 29). Both painful heat and loud sounds induced TCE effects, suggesting a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific temporal dynamics. Increasing pupil size and decreasing power of neural alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) with higher painful heat indicate bottom-up modulation of the autonomic nervous system and a release of neural inhibition, respectively. Critically, expectation of pain - but not loud sound - induced an alpha power increase, demonstrating to-down contributions to temporal filtering of pain. However, no direct neurophysiological correlates of subjectively experienced TCE effects were found. Findings suggests that a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific neurophysiological dynamics shapes the processing of aversive stimulation.",

      "title": "Neuronal activity induces myelin voltage changes that reflect action potential dependent myelin potassium buffering",
      "content": "Vertebrate axons can be wrapped by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes. This cellular interaction ensures fast and accurate propagation of action potentials, but the physiology of the myelin sheath is almost completely unknown. To investigate the physiology of the myelin sheath, we implemented an imaging strategy that allowed optical measurements of myelin membrane voltage, with the aim to identify physiological changes of the myelin membrane during neuronal firing. We expressed the genetically encoded voltage indicator ASAP3 in mouse oligodendrocytes in vivo and subsequently investigated myelin physiology by optically measuring myelin membrane voltage. We found that myelin depolarizes during neuronal activity, which is blocked by inhibiting neuronal action potentials. Pharmacological and knock-out experiments of Kir4.1 showed that potassium uptake channels mediate action potential induced depolarization. Blocking myelin dependent potassium uptake and direct application of high potassium to identified axons induced axonal initiated and antidromic propagating action potentials. Our study shows that myelin is not an electrically passive insulator, but exhibits ion dynamics and its physiological response is fine tuned to neuronal activity. By facilitating potassium removal during action potentials, myelin supports high precision axonal firing. Genetically encoded sensors are thus a useful tool to study physiological properties of myelin, inaccessible by classical techniques.",

      "title": "A map of the cortical functional network mediating naturalistic navigation",
      "content": "Navigation through the real world requires close coordination of perception, planning, and motor actions. Prior neuroimaging studies that used controlled stimuli and tasks have suggested that navigation-related information is represented broadly across the human cerebral cortex. While three regions in the anterior visual cortex have been well-studied, the extent and functional properties of regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices are not as well-characterized. To map and characterize the full cortical network that underpins active navigation in the real world, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity from participants performing a naturalistic navigation task. Banded ridge regression was used to fit high-dimensional encoding models for 28,134 features to this data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions: five prefrontal and three parietal regions, along with three regions in the visual cortex that had been identified and characterized in previous studies. Analysis of encoding model weights shows that these 11 regions transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs, and are organized along distributed cortical functional gradients. These results provide a unified description of the functional properties and organization of the cortical network that mediates naturalistic navigation. We anticipate that these maps will provide rich targets to inform more targeted future studies of human navigation.",

      "title": "Verbal versus Nonverbal Processing Leads to Generalized Hemispheric Laterality Effects that Span Multiple Networks",
      "content": "Precision neuroimaging was used to explore specialization for verbal versus nonverbal processing. Consistent with prior findings, individuals exhibited a spatially left-lateralized association language network, with regions in both hemispheres robustly responding to processing of meaning-based sentences. We next examined differential responses to verbal (words) versus nonverbal (faces) materials within the same working memory task. The right hemisphere components of the language network responded more strongly to nonverbal than to verbal materials, splitting the network's functional profile between the hemispheres. Similar patterns were observed across multiple association networks including putative cognitive-control, action-mode, and attention networks. The hemispheric laterality effect was prospectively replicated in a second independent study. These findings highlight a generalized laterality phenomenon that transcends individual specialized networks and aligns with a broad mechanism that modulates processing between the hemispheres.",

      "title": "NeuRoDev resolves lifelong temporal and cellular variation in human cortical gene expression",
      "content": "Understanding how the human brain develops and functions requires direct analysis of human cells. Single-cell atlases open unprecedented opportunities to survey cell physiological molecular states as the brain develops. However, technical challenges limit their potential. We present NeuRoDev, a computational resource with highly curated transcriptomic data and novel analytical tools to investigate neuronal and glial development in the human cortex. NeuRoDev compresses ~1M single-cell transcriptomes into integrative summary networks of reproducible cell clusters that capture temporal and cellular variation across all stages of human brain development. It provides a reference framework to directly interrogate cellular maturation dynamics, contextualize gene function, and interpret experimental organoid models. We use NeuRoDev to investigate developmental variation in cell physiology, reconstruct genesis and maturation dynamics in neuronal and glial cells, and interpret time-series data from organoid models. NeuRoDev is provided as a freely available software package and as web applications for interactive data analysis.",
