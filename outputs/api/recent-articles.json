      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Diverse Visual Experience Promotes Integrated Representations and Mitigates Bias in Deep Neural Networks for Face Perception",
      "content": "Humans are experts at recognizing faces, yet this expertise is not uniform: people perceive faces from familiar facial groups more accurately than those from unfamiliar ones, a phenomenon known as the Other-Race Effect (ORE). Although the ORE is well established, it remains unclear how exposure diversity reshapes the underlying representations that give rise to it. Here, we combine deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with human behavioral data to investigate how training diversity influences the emergence and mitigation of recognition biases. CNNs trained exclusively on either Asian or White faces reproduced ORE-like biases, showing reduced performance for faces from unfamiliar groups. In contrast, a CNN trained on both Asian and White faces showed minimal bias, balanced performance across groups, and an integrated representational geometry spanning both groups. Critically, this model best captured human face-matching behavior across both Asian and White participants, outperforming single-trained networks on cross-group trials. These findings show how diverse visual experience reorganizes representational geometry to support cross-group generalization in artificial systems and provide computational insight into how diverse experience may shape more integrated face representations in humans.",

      "title": "Feel the Beat: The Impact of Rhythms on Dynamic Visual Search",
      "content": "Rhythms are everywhere. We encounter them daily within our environment and produce them regularly through our movements, speech and sensory systems. In both cognitive and clinical contexts, external rhythms have been shown to enhance performance when they are aligned with, predict, or entrain stimuli onsets or relevant moments in time. In this study, we aimed to understand the impact of external and internal rhythms on performance in a task devoid of rhythmic temporal structure. We thus investigated the differential impact of auditory beats (1, 2, 5 Hz or no beat) on detection in a non rhythmic, dynamic search task requiring the continuous deployment of attention. We additionally assessed whether the influence of auditory beats on detection was modulated by individual rhythmic preferences as measured by their spontaneous motor tempo. Overall, we found that auditory rhythms enhanced visual task performance, even in the absence of rhythmic structure within the measured task, improving both detection accuracy and response speed. This enhancement was tempo dependent, with the strongest facilitation observed at 2 Hz. The magnitude of the observed benefits varied with individual spontaneous motor tempo, such that participants with slower SMTs exhibited the greatest performance benefits due to the presence of auditory rhythms. We propose that rhythmic stimulation may serve as a powerful scaffold for sustained performance in the context of dynamic and temporally unpredictable environments.",

      "title": "Incentive valence differentially engages open- and closed-loop basal ganglia circuits during movement initiation",
      "content": "Incentives modulate voluntary movement, yet the circuitry channeling these signals into motor output remains unclear. Classical models emphasize a closed-loop circuit (CLC) linking dorsal putamen (PUTd) with motor cortex, but this pathway is anatomically segregated from affective processing regions. Anatomical and clinical evidence point to an alternative: an open-loop circuit (OLC) from ventral putamen (PUTv) that may route affective signals to motor cortex. Here, we conducted two experiments to test whether a functional OLC exists in humans and whether it is differentially engaged by incentive conditions. First, in 7 T resting-state fMRI (multi-echo), PUTv showed robust functional connectivity with both affective and motor regions, including the cingulate motor area (CMA), even after accounting for PUTd variance. This connectivity pattern supports the plausibility of an independent pathway linking affective basal ganglia regions to the motor cortex. Second, in 3 T task fMRI (incentivized reaching), jackpot (high-reward) and robber (high-loss avoidance) incentive conditions produced distinct behavioral and neural signatures. Jackpot produced a speed-accuracy trade-off, with faster movement initiation but more false starts. Neurally, this coincided with engagement (BOLD responses relevant for initiation speed) being reduced in CLC nodes but not in OLC. Robber, in contrast, eliminated engagement in both OLC and CLC nodes, instead recruiting stopping-related regions (e.g., STN), consistent with an avoidance phenomenology. Together, these findings support a versatile architecture for movement initiation that flexibly engages distinct cortico-subcortical circuits depending on incentive phenomenology, and offer a candidate mechanism through which affective salience and valence modulate voluntary movement.",

      "title": "Parkinsonism Reversal and Dopaminergic Resilience: Lessons from a Rotenone-induced Parkinson's Disease Model",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by profound loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, yet the underlying mechanism remains incompletely defined. Mitochondrial toxins can induce acute degeneration of DA neurons and Parkinsonism-like phenotypes in animal models, and epidemiological studies have linked pesticide exposure to increased PD risk; however, the long-term effects of pesticide exposure remain elusive. Here, we examined both the acute and long-term effects of rotenone exposure in mice to understand PD onset, progression, and recovery. A 21-day regimen of rotenone intraperitoneal injections (2.5 mg/kg/day) induced robust Parkinsonism-like deficits by the 4th week, including impaired locomotion, increased anxiety-like behaviors, and deficits in motor balancing and coordination. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by pronounced reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Unexpectedly, these functional impairments fully resolved by 12 months, and rotenone-treated mice behaved equally well as age-matched controls. In parallel, the TH expression and DA neuron density in SNc were restored to control levels. Together, these longitudinal results demonstrate that chronic rotenone injection induces robust but reversible Parkinsonism in the acute phase, with limited long-term consequence on Parkinsonism upon toxin cessation. These findings contrast with the prevailing view that environmental pesticide exposure irreversibly drives PD and instead they reveal a substantial resilience and adaptive capacity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in vivo.",

      "title": "Cyfip2 mediates sensorimotor integration of visual input through Rac1-dependent actin remodeling",
      "content": "Sensorimotor integration of visual input is essential for adaptive behaviors such as navigation, hunting, and escape from danger, yet our understanding of the developmental mechanisms that assemble these visuomotor circuits remains incomplete. Cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 2 (cyfip2) is a key factor in retinotectal axon guidance in zebrafish larvae, and it has conserved roles in regulating actin dynamics and mRNA translation. Variants in human CYFIP2 cause neurodevelopmental disabilities including vision deficits, but how it functions to shape visually-driven behavior is unclear. Here we measured multiple visually-mediated behaviors, brain-wide activity, and conditional rescue of behavioral defects in larval zebrafish to define cyfip2's roles in assembling visual sensorimotor circuits. cyfip2 mutants display severe deficits in prey capture and dark and light flash responses, despite normal optokinetic responses, indicating intact retinal phototransduction but disrupted downstream sensorimotor integration. Both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity are reduced in the optic tectum of cyfip2 mutants, as measured by phospho-ERK immunostaining and pan-neuronal calcium, consistent with impaired functional input from retinal ganglion cells. Finally, using conditional transgenic alleles to temporally control Cyfip2 expression, we identified a critical window from 30-50 hours post-fertilization during which Cyfip2 acts through Rac1-dependent actin polymerization but not FMRP-mediated translation to establish visual behavior circuits. Together, these findings define how and when Cyfip2 acts as a critical organizer of vertebrate visual circuit development, providing mechanistic insight into the visual and motor deficits in human subjects with variants in CYFIP2.",

Conventional approaches often apply narrowband band-pass filters to one or a few predefined frequency bands, followed by fixed power- or amplitude-thresholding to identify oscillatory events. Although recent unsupervised alternatives based on Hidden Markov models (HMM) address these limitations, they still require a priori specification of the number of states and can underfit or overfit when the number of states is misspecified. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric method that identifies distinct oscillatory states while inferring an appropriate number of states directly from the data. This method combines time-delay embedding (TDE) with the Dirichlet-process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM). TDE augments the signal with time-shifted copies, enabling the DP-GMM to capture frequency-specific local autocovariance structures, while the Dirichlet-process prior adapts model complexity by pruning inactive components. We benchmarked the approach against a filter-based thresholding method and the time-delay embedded HMM using single-channel synthetic data designed to mimic neural time series (e.g., EEG, MEG, and local field potentials), with multiple frequency components embedded in 1/f-like noise. In this setting, the proposed model reliably recovered multiple distinct frequency components under noisy conditions while also inferring the correct number of oscillatory states. Applied to a resting-state motor-cortex MEG dataset, the model identified multiple frequency-selective, short-lived oscillatory states that exhibited substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in peak frequency, occurrence rate, and power. Overall, this provides a fully unsupervised route to discovering frequency-selective oscillatory states without predefining frequency bands or selecting the number of states in advance.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Neurocognitive Trajectories in a Large Cohort of Youth Who Use Cannabis: Combining Self-Report and Toxicology",
      "content": "Adolescents experience extensive neurocognitive development, which cannabis use potentially impacting developmental trajectories. Here, we comprehensively assess the influence of adolescent cannabis use onset on neurocognitive trajectories and consider how recent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) may influence neurocognition. We use the large, diverse longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset, combining self-reported substance use with objective toxicological tests (hair, urine, breath, oral fluid). Longitudinal mixed methods of the full cohort (n=11,036, ages 9-17) investigate time-varying cannabis onset on neurocognitive performance. Secondarily, in participants with repeat toxicological hair testing (n=645) at ages 12-16, we consider the influence of THC v. CBD v. Controls. Covariates include sociodemographics, family history of substance use disorder, prenatal substance exposure, early psychopathology, other substance use, and nesting for participant ID, study site, and family ID. Cannabis group interacted with age to show altered neurocognitive trajectories across domains (immediate recall and delayed memory, processing speed, inhibitory control, visuospatial processing, language, and working memory; {beta}s=-0.11 - -0.52). Secondary models indicated hair-identified THC exposure predicted worse episodic memory than in Controls ({beta}=-0.60, p=.007), with no difference between CBD exposed and Controls. Data suggest those who use cannabis show a slight cognitive advantage during late childhood, with demonstrate diminished trajectories over time. These flattened neurocognitive trajectories in youth (ages 9-17) who initiate cannabis use were demonstrated after accounting for within-person change and numerous known confounds and improving accuracy in cannabis groupings through incorporating toxicological measures. Continued monitoring of this cohort will clarify cannabinoid-cognition relationships into young adulthood, including the impact of timing of cannabis use initiation.",

      "title": "Thermal lensing during infrared neural stimulation enables spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry",
      "content": "Photothermal laser tissue interactions are challenging to study at the subcellular level due to the complexity of accurately characterizing spatial energy distributions. Infrared (IR) neural stimulation, a label-free photothermal neuromodulation technique using pulsed IR light, has demonstrated promise but lacks standardized, high-resolution dosimetry methods. Objective. In this study, we present an automated, imaging-based workflow to perform spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry. This method uses thermal lensing to mark the location of IR exposure within the imaging field of view, enabling precise assessment of the radiant exposure dosage and correlated neuronal responses. Approach. Neuronal Ca2+responses to single IR pulses of varying duration (350 \u00b5s, 2 ms, and 8 ms) were measured using widefield fluorescence microscopy. The thermal lensing artifact (TLA) observed during stimulation was used to model the spatial energy distribution of the laser beam profile. Neuronal Ca2+ responses were analyzed relative to the local radiant exposure, H0(x,y), and the average radiant exposure, dosage, Havg, calculated using the laser pulse energy divided by the laser spot area. Main results. The TLA provided a reliable fiducial for tracking the IR stimulus within the imaging field. Neuronal responses to INS were spatially dependent and exhibited three phenotypes: unreactive, low-amplitude, and high-amplitude. The Gaussian laser beam profile led to cells near the beam center receiving higher radiant exposure dosages, exceeding activation thresholds. We find that shorter pulse durations required lower radiant exposure dosages to elicit neuronal responses. The Havg consistently underestimates the radiant exposure required for stimulation. The H0(x,y) required for stimulation did not produce measurable cellular damage. Significance. Local radiant exposure dosage dictates neuronal activation during INS. Our method provides a standardized, high-throughput approach for performing spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry at microscopic level.",

      "content": "Objective. Damage to the peripheral nerves frequently leads to significant impairments in their functional capacity, highlighting the need for effective treatments that can facilitate nerve repair. This study explores the potential of grape skin extract (Ex), alone and in combination with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), to enhance regeneration following sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in rats. Approach. ZnO NPs were synthesized using both a conventional chemical route and a green synthesis method in which Ex served as a natural reducing and capping agent. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Thermogravimetric analysis, Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, zeta potential, and Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analyses to confirm the role of Ex in shaping nanoparticle morphology and surface properties. Functional recovery and histological outcomes were then assessed in a murine SNI model. Main results. Treatment with Ex and ZnO/Ex significantly reduced collagen accumulation, fibrosis, and tissue vacuolization compared to untreated controls. Both interventions also improved myelination and enhanced the sciatic function index, indicating improved neural repair. Significance. These findings demonstrate that Ex and ZnO/Ex promote nerve regeneration and highlight their potential as promising candidates for the development of biogenic nanotherapeutics targeting peripheral nerve injuries.",

      "title": "Incorporating multi-modal prompt learning into foundation models enhances predictability of visual fMRI responses to dynamic natural stimuli",
      "content": "Objective. Modeling neural encoding of visual stimuli often uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict human brain response to external stimuli. However, each DNN depends on networks tailored for computer vision tasks, resulting in suboptimal brain correspondence. On the other hand, when end-to-end optimizing the encoding process for specific brain regions, challenges like training difficulties arise. Additionally, these models mostly focus on visual information processing, while the human brain integrates multi-modal information such as language to achieve a comprehensive understanding. Approach. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal prompt learning (PL) model for neural encoding of dynamic natural stimuli. Specifically, we leverage the powerful representation ability of pre-trained foundation models and fine-tune them using our multi-modal prompts. These prompts, which include textual and visual prompts tailored to each specific regions of interest, can adapt foundation models to neural encoding tasks with fewer trainable parameters. We use the CLIP For video Clip retrieval (CLIP4clip) and Video Masked Autoencoder V2 (videoMAEv2) for feature extraction with backbone freezing, refine the representations via PL, and map the fused multi-modal features to predict voxel-wise brain responses. Main results. Extensive experiments on two functional magnetic resonance imaging video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and public models. Significance. This work highlights the potential of prompt-based fine-tuning strategies in bridging the gap between foundation models and neural encoding tasks.",
