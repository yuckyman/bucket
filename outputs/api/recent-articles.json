      "title": "Beta bursts mediate amygdala gating of hippocampal emotional encoding",
      "content": "The amygdala and hippocampus are central to emotional processing, yet the transient neural dynamics coordinating these regions remain unclear. We simultaneously recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials from both regions in epilepsy patients during an emotional image-rating task. Neurons in both regions responded to images with firing rate changes that predicted subjective ratings of extreme pleasantness or unpleasantness. To examine the underlying oscillatory mechanisms, we analyzed beta bursts (13-30 Hz)-transient, high-power events-since conventional spectral analyses revealed no valence-specific patterns. Beta bursts were associated with increased gamma amplitude and enhanced phase coherence in both structures, with beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling capturing emotion-related dynamics. Critically, amygdala beta bursts strongly suppressed hippocampal firing through interneuron activation during negative valence processing, whereas hippocampal bursts showed no reciprocal influence. These findings suggest that beta bursts provide a temporal code for emotion and represent a candidate mechanism for targeted neuromodulation in mood disorders.",

      "title": "Local thalamic interneurons drive spindle termination and enable sleep-dependent learning",
      "content": "The thalamus is central to fundamental brain functions including sensation, attention, and sleep through the precise generation and regulation of neuronal ensemble oscillatory activity. Sensory thalamic circuits are considered feedforward structures, lacking lateral connectivity, while recurrence in the network is mediated by interactions with inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Here, we define previously uncharacterized functional roles of local thalamic interneurons, a component of the sensory thalamus whose function has remained unexplored. We demonstrate that local interneuron activation induces rebound oscillations in thalamocortical relay neurons ex vivo and neocortical spindles in vivo, while their inhibition increases spindle occurrence, overall spindle duration and impairs sensory learning. Our findings reveal that local thalamic interneurons have shared and complementary functions to those of thalamic reticular neurons and are required for proper spindle formation and sleep-dependent learning. Together, this work establishes an important neural substrate of thalamocortical circuit function.",

      "content": "The Drosophila giant fiber system is a well-characterized escape circuit that enables precise investigation of synaptic development and function. Here, we examined the role of the cell adhesion molecule Dscam1 in shaping presynaptic architecture and supporting circuit performance. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dscam1 in giant fiber interneurons, we observed reduced presynaptic terminal volume, smaller synapse interfaces, and reduced levels of electrical (Shak-B) and chemical (Bruchpilot) synaptic proteins. Despite this reduction in overall abundance, protein localization and density remained unchanged. Functionally, Dscam1 knockdown impaired circuit performance, both increasing latency and reducing success at high frequency demand. Correlation and principal component analysis of our data set show that anatomical variables, particularly presynaptic terminal size, best predicted circuit output. These findings identify Dscam1 as a key developmental regulator of presynaptic terminal size, linking early axon terminal elaboration to adult synaptic function in a central motor circuit. More broadly, our results exemplify a volumetric scaling model where available presynaptic area constrains the distribution of synaptic proteins, both electrical and chemical.",

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, capable of operating reliably in adverse weather and lighting conditions, offers a promising alternative for road surface monitoring. In this study, six representative road surface conditions-dry, wet, thin-ice, ice, snow, and sludge-were experimentally implemented on asphalt...",
