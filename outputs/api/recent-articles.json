      "title": "A comprehensive, open-source battery of movement imagery ability tests: Development and psychometric properties",
      "content": "Imagining actions is a covert and multidimensional skill difficult to quantify. Comprehensive assessments rarely combine measures of imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation. We developed and validated a combination of tests to assess these processes of movement imagery, online. 180 healthy individuals completed the MIQ-RS questionnaire (generation), the Imagined Finger Sequence Task (iFST; maintenance), and the Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT; manipulation). MIQ-RS showed a bifactorial structure (visual and kinesthetic modalities) according to confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability (internal consistency) was good. In the iFST, internal validity analyses via generalized mixed models showed a clear effect of sequence complexity, stronger for execution than imagery. Reliability, estimated via signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using hierarchical Bayesian models, was also adequate (SNR > 1.6). In the HLJT, expected effects of rotation angle, hand view, and their interaction, consistent with biomechanical constraints, were also found. Reliability was also adequate (SNR > 1.75). Criterion validity across tests, assessed using Bayesian Spearman correlations, showed that correlations were generally absent (BF01 > 3), and when present, of small magnitude (r < 0.27). Test-retest reliability (122 participants reassessed 6-8 days after), computed via Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs), was generally adequate (ICCs > 0.67). We conclude that the online versions of these tests showed adequate structural/internal validity and (test-retest) reliability. However, weak criterion validity suggests individuals with high ability to generate movement imagery may not necessarily have high ability to maintain and/or manipulate movement imagery, underscoring the need for comprehensive assessment of this capacity.",

      "title": "Disrupted Integration-Segregation Balance in the Intact Hemisphere in Chronic Spatial Neglect",
      "content": "Spatial neglect is a common and disabling consequence of right hemisphere stroke, characterized by a failure to attend to the contralesional left space, and frequently persists into the chronic stage. There is robust evidence on the role of right-hemisphere frontoparietal dysfunction, interhemispheric structural disconnection and maladaptive activity in the left hemisphere in the persistence of neglect. However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradienttypically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics. These findings reveal a previously overlooked aspect of neglect pathophysiology: the maladaptive dominance of the non-lesioned hemisphere's intrinsic architecture. By combining innovative gradient-based metrics with classical lesion approaches, our study offers a new framework for understanding neglect as an emergent property of large-scale network imbalance, with clinical implications for diagnosis and intervention, and theoretical consequences for models of hemispheric asymmetries and conscious access.",

      "title": "Computational modelling of schizophrenia-associated alterations of ion-channel-encoding gene expression predicts a decrease in delta power",
      "content": "Schizophrenia presents with a wide range of phenotypes that can help to understand the the mechanisms of the disease. Among these, alterations in delta oscillations are especially amenable to experimental investigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes remain insufficiently understood. Biophysically detailed computational modeling offers a powerful approach to investigate these phenomena, as it enables multi-scale integration of genetic and electrophysiological data. In this study, we developed a minimal network model composed of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental neurons to replicate experimental data on the effects of pharmacological blockage of gabaergic neurotransmission on delta-band power. We inserted post-mortem RNA expression data from the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices of individuals with schizophrenia and matched controls into the model to study the effects of schizophrenia-associated alterations of ion-channel expression on delta-oscillation power. Our simulations revealed a significant reduction in delta-band power in schizophrenia, driven by altered expression of calcium channel genes in pyramidal neurons. These results provide insights into the genetic contributions to oscillatory disruptions observed in schizophrenia, and our modelling framework can help to develop stratification strategies that bridge genetics and in vivo electrophysiology.",

      "content": "Non-human primates (NHPs) are a crucial model for studying glaucoma because of their similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology and pathology. Our goal in this study was to quantify in vivo NHP lamina cribrosa (LC) shapes at low, normal, and elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs), and compare them with literature reported values for in vivo human LCs. We imaged the optic nerve heads (ONH) of seven eyes from six rhesus macaque monkeys using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Distinct ACEs profiles were significantly associated with episodic memory and HPA dysregulation-related inflammation. The severe adversity, parental conflict, and low adversity groups showed no reliable predictions to cognition or cognitive status. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of timing, measurement, and potential adaptive mechanisms when examining inflammatory pathways that associate childhood adversity with cognitive aging in older Black adults.",

National guidelines recommend vision assessment following a fall; however, adherence remains suboptimal. This quality improvement project aimed to evaluate compliance with national recommendations and implement interventions to improve visual assessment rates in elderly inpatients.
