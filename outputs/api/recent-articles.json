      "title": "MitoEM 2.0 - A Benchmark for Challenging 3D MitochondriaInstance Segmentation from EM Images",
      "content": "We present MitoEM 2.0, a curated data resource for training and evaluating three-dimensional (3D) mitochondria instance segmentation in volume electron microscopy. The collection assembles multiscale vEM datasets (FIB-SEM, SBF-SEM, ssSEM) spanning diverse tissues and species, with expert-verified instance labels emphasizing biologically difficult scenarios, including dense mitochondrial packing, hyperfused networks, and thin filamentous connections with ambiguous boundaries. All releases include native-resolution volumes and standardized processed versions, per-volume metadata (voxel size, modality, tissue, splits), and official train/validation/test partitions to enable reproducible benchmarking. Annotations follow a consistent protocol with quality checks and instance reindexing. Data are provided in NIfTI with nnU-Net-compatible layout, alongside machine-readable split files and checksums. Baseline scripts support common training pipelines and size-stratified evaluation. By consolidating challenging volumes and harmonized labels, MitoEM 2.0 facilitates robust model development and fair comparison across methods while supporting reuse in bioimage analysis, algorithm benchmarking, and teaching.",

      "title": "Head stabilization behavior and underlying circuit mechanisms in larval zebrafish",
      "content": "Head stabilization is essential for animal survival, enabling stable sensory input and effective motor coordination. Animals stabilize their heads in response to vestibular stimuli through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). While the VCR has been characterized in tetrapod vertebrates, it remains unknown whether fish, which lack an anatomical neck, employ a comparable behavior. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit VCR-like behaviors: they adjust their head orientation relative to the body by rostral body flexion during pitch tilts. The rostral body flexed ventrally during head-up posture, whereas it flexed dorsally during head-down posture. These flexions partially compensated for the head pitch changes, thereby contributing to head stabilization. We also identified the muscles and neural circuits responsible for these two types of body flexions. Both the dorsal and ventral flexions were mediated by the same vestibular nucleus, but neural signals were transmitted through distinct pathways, either involving or bypassing a class of reticulospinal neurons. The dorsal and ventral flexions were ultimately produced by specialized dorsal and ventral muscles in the rostral body, respectively. The neural circuits underlying these body flexions in fish share similarities with those underlying the mammalian VCR. Together, our results demonstrate that fish exhibit a VCR-like behavior through comparable circuit mechanisms, suggesting that the VCR is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates.",

      "title": "The antiviral Interferon pathway drives astrocyte aging and motor decline",
      "content": "Aging encompasses low-level inflammation and motor decline. Astrocytes are neuroregulatory glial cells that change in aging, particularly in the cerebellum, which is essential for movement coordination. Regulation and functionality of cerebellar astrocytes in aging is unknown. We show that antiviral type I Interferons (IFN-I) drive motor deficits and regional astrocyte aging. Transcriptomics reveal that cerebellar astrocytes, but not cortical, exhibit an antiviral state that intensifies with age, with increased expression of Stat1. Aged mice display motor deficits similar to humans that improve after peripheral IFN-I receptor neutralization, whereas astrocyte Stat1 induces motor deficits during chronic inflammation in adults. While strong systemic inflammation induces astrocyte antiviral state, in aging, chromatin de-repression of Stat1 and nucleotide sensors in cerebellar astrocytes amplifies local IFN-I signaling. We identify functional interaction between a classical immune pathway and astrocytes, representing an actionable strategy to preserve motor function in aging.",

      "title": "When Brain Models Are not Universal: Benchmarking of Ethnic Bias in MRI-Based Cognitive Prediction Across Modalities",
      "content": "Predictive neuroimaging models promise precision medicine but risk exacerbating health inequities if they perform unevenly across ethnic/racial groups. Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development data, we benchmarked ethnic/racial bias in models predicting cognitive functioning from 81 MRI phenotypes across four training strategies. Models trained on one ethnicity performed best within that group. Models trained on participants sampled without regard to ethnicity, a common practice, performed better on White participants, likely because the ABCD sample was predominantly White. Training on equal-sized White and African American subsamples reduced disparities without accuracy loss. Structural MRI exhibited the greatest bias, whereas task-based fMRI phenotypes were more equitable. Stronger brain-cognition associations generalized more equitably, but multimodal stacking despite enhancing prediction, did not improve fairness. Increasing representation of African American participants improved performance up to balanced sampling, with diminishing returns beyond. This first modality-wide benchmark reveals pervasive, modality dependent ethnic bias in cognitive prediction and identifies key factors shaping equity in neuroimaging models.",

      "title": "Electrophysiological Brain Connectivity and Subjective States Evoked by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Mediodorsal Thalamus",
      "content": "Recent advances in human intracranial EEG (iEEG) have enabled new investigations into the role of the thalamus in human brain functions. In this study, we applied direct intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) to the mediodorsal (MD) subregion of the thalamus using both high-frequency (50 Hz, iESHF) and low-frequency (0.5 Hz, iESLF) procedures to examine its impact on conscious experience and causal brain connectivity in 30 patients with focal refractory epilepsy (128 electrode contacts). iESHF of the MD elicited reportable changes in conscious experience in 11 of 12 patients (39 sites; 83 stimulations across 27 unique pairs) - predominantly in the visceral, emotional, or somatosensory domains and often described as unpleasant without any lateralization effect. Our connectivity analyses based on iESLF revealed that the cingulate and insular cortices produced stronger electrophysiological responses in the MD (inflow connectivity) than did the sites in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) within the same individuals. Moreover, MD stimulation showed its strongest outflow connectivity to the cingulate, insular, and PFC regions, all significantly stronger than to medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Notably, inflow from both MTL and insula sites to the MD were significantly stronger than their reverse directions, indicating clear asymmetry in connectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that stimulation of the human thalamus can modulate conscious experience. They also highlight the extensive bidirectional connectivity between the MD and cingulate and insular cortices along with asymmetric connectivity between the MD and MTL and insula sites in the human brain.",

      "title": "Central role for fast nociceptors in mechanical nocifensive behavior and sensitization",
      "content": "Nociceptors, primary afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious stimuli, are broadly divided into slowly conducting unmyelinated C fibers and fast-conducting myelinated A fibers. Whereas C-nociceptors have been extensively studied, considerably less is known about the function of A-nociceptors. To address this gap, we developed an intersectional genetic approach for robust and selective interrogation and manipulation of mechanically responsive A-nociceptors (A-MNs) in mice. Optogenetic A-MN stimulation induced rapid and precise withdrawal reflexes as well as place aversion and facial expression changes consistent with pain affect, while inhibition strongly impaired mechanical nociceptive withdrawal reflexes, demonstrating that A-MNs are necessary and sufficien t for rapid avoidance of noxious mechanical stimuli. Prolonged A-MN activation induced mechanical allodynia and central sensitization. In a rare individual lacking thickly myelinated A{beta} fibers, mechanical withdrawal reflexes were completely absent, and pain perception reduced. Together, these findings identify fast-conducting mechano-nociceptors as essential drivers of nocifensive behaviors in mice and humans.",

      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",
