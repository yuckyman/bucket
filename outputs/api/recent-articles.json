      "title": "ALCOHOL AUGMENTS SPONTANEOUS GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION AND ACTION POTENTIAL FIRING IN IMMATURE MURINE CEREBELLAR GOLGI CELLS, LEADING TO ENHANCED INHIBITORY INPUT ONTO CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS",
      "content": "Golgi cells (GoCs) are cerebellar inhibitory interneurons that provide both phasic and tonic GABAergic input to cerebellar granule cells. They receive inhibitory control from Lugaro cells, other GoCs, and cerebellar nuclear inhibitory neurons via GABAergic and glycinergic inputs. Although fetal alcohol exposure is known to impair cerebellar function, its impact on developing GoC physiology remains unclear. We investigated the acute effects of ethanol on GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission in GoCs during the mouse equivalent of the human third trimester, a critical window for inhibitory circuit formation. To identify GoCs, we used VGAT-Venus transgenic mice, in which the vesicular GABA transporter promoter drives expression of the Venus fluorescent protein. Whole-cell patch-clamp and loose-patch recordings from postnatal day (P) 6-10 mice revealed that ethanol exposure dose-dependently increased the frequency of action potential-dependent GABA-A receptor-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in GoCs. While ethanol produced variable effects on GoC firing rates, it more consistently enhanced GABA-A-sPSC frequency in granule cells. We also examined expression of the K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a chloride exporter whose developmental upregulation drives the shift in GABAA receptor signaling from excitatory to inhibitory. Immunohistochemical analysis at P6 showed that GoCs express low levels of KCC2, suggesting that GABA-A receptor-mediated currents may remain depolarizing in a subset of GoCs. This property could contribute to ethanol-induced disruption of cerebellar circuit maturation. Together, these findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which ethanol perturbs inhibitory circuit development in the cerebellum.",

      "title": "Layer-specific glutamatergic inputs and Parvalbumin interneurons modulate early life stress induced alterations in prefrontal glutamate release during fear conditioning in pre-adolescent rats",
      "content": "Exposure to early life stress (ELS) can exert long-lasting impacts on emotional regulation. The corticolimbic system including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in fear learning. Using the limited bedding paradigm (LB), we examined the functional consequences of ELS on excitatory and inhibitory tone in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC after fear conditioning in rats. In adults, LB exposure enhanced in vivo glutamate release in the PL mPFC during fear conditioning in male, but not female offspring. In contrast, the glutamate response to fear conditioning was diminished in LB-exposed pre-adolescent males, but not females. We investigated whether reduced glutamatergic inputs and/or elevated inhibitory tone might contribute to the diminished glutamate response in the mPFC following LB in pre-adolescent male rats. Indeed, we found that LB exposure specifically increased the activation of PV, but not SST interneurons in layer V, but not layer II/III of the PL mPFC in fear-exposed pre-adolescent males. Presynaptic glutamate release probability was reduced by LB exposure in layer V, but increased in layer II/III of the PL mPFC. These functional changes might be related to the LB-induced alterations in the bilaminar distribution of BLA and vHIP projections to the PL mPFC we observed in pre-adolescent males. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS modifies glutamate release and PL mPFC function during fear conditioning in a sex- and age- dependent fashion, likely through layer-specific shifts in excitation/inhibition balance.",

      "content": "<p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

      "title": "Potentiation of Nigra-Striatal Dopaminergic Projection Underpins Core Autism-Like Behaviors in Valproate-Exposed Mice",
      "content": "<p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>",

      "title": "Optical Recordings of Unitary Synaptic Connections Reveal High and Random Local Connectivity between CA3 Pyramidal Cells",
      "content": "<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>",

      "title": "Asymmetries in Foveal Vision",
      "content": "<p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the  foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only  away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~ away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>",
