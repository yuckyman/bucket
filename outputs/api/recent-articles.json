      "title": "Active zone remodeling by Bruchpilot couples synaptic architecture to Kv1/Shaker excitability control",
      "content": "Presynaptic active zones are known to undergo state-dependent remodeling across sleep, circadian, and experience-dependent conditions, yet how such structural changes influence synaptic computation and excitability has remained unclear. Here, we address this gap by examining the functional consequences of physiological upscaling of the active zone scaffold Bruchpilot (BRP), within the range previously observed during natural state-dependent plasticity. We show that moderate BRP elevation expands the number of functional release sites while surprisingly reducing vesicle release probability, thereby establishing a presynaptic operating mode with selectively enhanced transmission at intermediate firing frequencies. This remodeled mode depends on Kv1/Shaker potassium channels, which normally constrain the increased structural capacity generated by BRP; accordingly, perturbation of Shaker abolishes BRP-dependent reductions in release probability and unmasks an enlarged synaptic output capacity. To test the functional relevance of this coupling, we examined sleepless mutants, in which Kv1/Shaker channels are destabilized and presynaptic remodeling is compromised. We show that direct, physiological-level BRP upscaling selectively restores the Shaker/Hyperkinetic channel complex from near-undetectable levels toward normal abundance without inducing global proteomic changes, and correspondingly rescues excitability balance, oxidative stress resistance, lifespan, and mid-term memory. Together, these findings identify a mechanistic coupling between active zone architecture and intrinsic excitability control and demonstrate how presynaptic structural plasticity shapes frequency-dependent transmission and functional robustness under stress.",

      "title": "Chronic stress abnormalize microglial-vascular interaction via AT1R signaling and microglia activation to drive depression-like behaviors",
      "content": "Depression entails a range of pathological processes in the brain, typically characterized by microglia activation, neural dysfunction, and vascular dysregulation. While it is well established that activated microglia inflict damage to neurons through direct and indirect microglia-neuron interactions, their interaction with vasculature and the associated regulation of vascular structure and function in depression remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), we find that in stressed mice, activated microglia present reduced motility and decreased contact area with vasculature, which is accompanied by pathological vascular structure and function, marked by reduced vessel density, narrowed vascular diameters, and sluggish blood flow velocity. We observe that vascular structure in the stressed mice is rapidly modified by the vascular-contacted microglia. These vascular-contacted microglia show upregulated angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression, which is not present in the vascular-uncontacted microglia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AT1R signaling together with microglia activation under chronic stress are critical mediators for the altered microglial-vascular contact situation, vascular dysregulation, as well as the depression-like behaviors. Together, our findings reveal that under CUS, the aberrant microglial-vascular interaction, including the dysregulated microglial vasoregulation arising from AT1R signaling and microglia activation, leads to depression, forging a new link between chronic stress and depression.",

      "title": "The impact of downsampling on data quality, univariate measurement and multivariate pattern analysis in event-related potential research",
      "content": "The choice of sampling rate is a critical preprocessing step in event-related potential (ERP) research, yet its impact on different analytic approaches remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically evaluated how downsampling affects data quality measured via Standardized Measurement Error (SME), conventional univariate ERP metrics (mean amplitude, peak amplitude, peak latency, and 50% area latency), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA; decoding). We analyzed seven commonly studied ERP components: P3, N400, N170, N2pc, mismatch negativity, error-related negativity, and lateralized readiness potential collected from neurotypical young adults. Results showed that both amplitude- and latency-based scores were significantly affected by sampling rate changes, particularly for 50% area latency that presented increased SME (reduced data quality) at lower sampling rates. Amplitude-based measures and their corresponding effect sizes were more influenced by sampling rate variations, whereas latency-based measures were comparatively stable across different temporal resolutions. In contrast, multivariate decoding performance remained highly robust, with decoding accuracy and effect sizes showing minimal variation even at the lowest sampling rate (e.g., 64 Hz). Overall, these findings suggest that caution should be exercised when employing lower sampling rates for data quality and conventional univariate ERP analyses. Nevertheless, lower sampling rates (e.g., 64 Hz) may still be appropriate for decoding analyses, particularly in studies where precise temporal resolution is not critical. For researchers analyzing ERP data with similar components, noise levels, and participant populations as in this study, following these recommendations should yield robust statistical power.",

      "title": "Activation of neurogenesis improves amyloid-\u03b2 pathology and cognitive function through AMP kinase signaling in Alzheimer's disease model mice",
      "content": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging and in neurological disorders, leading to cognitive impairment. We previously demonstrated that a treatment of inducing Plagl2, a zinc finger transcription factor gene, and antagonizing Dyrk1a, a gene associated with Down syndrome, referred to as iPaD, can functionally rejuvenate aged neural stem cells (NSCs), thereby enhancing neurogenesis and improving cognition in aged mice. Here, we found that NSC-specific iPaD treatment effectively activated neurogenesis, reduced amyloid-{beta} deposition, and improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed widespread significant changes in gene expression in the hippocampus following iPaD treatment. The upregulated genes included those associated with the activation of astrocytes and microglia involved in amyloid-{beta} clearance, while the downregulated genes included several that are upregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients, but whose roles in disease progression remain unclear. Among the latter genes, knockdown of Prkag2, a gene encoding protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2, in the hippocampus most effectively enhanced neurogenesis and reduced amyloid-{beta} accumulation. Notably, both iPaD treatment and Prkag2 knockdown activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, thereby upregulating genes involved in autophagy and cellular homeostasis. These results suggest that Prkag2 may represent a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.",

      "title": "Did you see the sound? A Bayesian Perspective on Crossmodal Perception in Low Vision",
      "content": "Multisensory integration is often assumed to increase when visual input is degraded, yet it remains unclear whether low vision enhances susceptibility to cross-modal illusions or whether such effects depend on local variations in visual reliability. We tested low vision and sighted control participants on the Double Flash Illusion across 24 visual-field locations while separately measuring flash-detection accuracy. Both groups showed the expected auditory-driven increase in perceived flash numerosity, but only sighted controls reliably experienced the classic \"double-flash\" percept. Illusion strength did not vary with eccentricity; instead, it was strongly predicted by local flash detection accuracy, indicating that sound-induced percepts depend on the availability of a reliable visual signal. Bayesian Causal Inference modeling revealed substantially weaker and more variable fits for low vision observers, with poorer fits associated with reduced visual sensitivity. Although model parameters did not differ significantly between groups, the similarity in estimated visual noise likely reflects model limitations rather than true equivalence in sensory precision. Together, these findings show that low vision does not globally amplify audiovisual interactions; rather, auditory enhancement depends on local visual reliability, and degraded vision leads to weaker alignment with Bayesian-optimal predictions.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "title": "Chronic electroconvulsive shock disrupts hippocampal physiology and impairs associative memory in mice",
      "content": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for depression but it has undesirable side effects on various aspects of cognition, including memory. Patients might display retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events and anterograde amnesia in tests of recall and recognition memory. These amnestic effects are likely to depend, at least in part, on changes in the hippocampus. ECT-induced volume increases in the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus subregion in particular, correlate with the cognitive deficits. However, the precise cellular and behavioral effects of ECT remain poorly understood. Here, we therefore subjected male and female mice to chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and examined effects on hippocampal physiology and memory. Perforant path inputs onto dentate gyrus neurons were examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings in hippocampal slices. In the intact slice, perforant path stimulation did not result in any synaptic or spiking differences in mice given sham vs ECS treatments. However, GABAA blockade increased depolarization and spiking in sham, but not ECS-treated, mice. Voltage clamp recordings further revealed weaker perforant path excitation of dentate gyrus neurons in ECS-treated mice. Extrapolating these findings to the intact animal, we then used Fos expression as a proxy for neural activity, and found that ECS blunted exploration-induced hippocampal activation, which was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus. Finally, recognition memory tasks revealed that ECS impaired memory for object-context associations but not memory for objects or locations. Collectively, these experiments reveal that a clinically relevant schedule of ECS disrupts synaptic and circuit functions of the hippocampus and causes anterograde amnesia in a test of episodic-like associative memory.",

      "content": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport is crucial for waste clearance and the maintenance of healthy brain function. Various factors, including respiration, have been proposed to drive CSF pulsation. Despite the close relationship between CSF movement and respiration, the impact of different slow respiratory frequencies on CSF oscillations remains unclear. Utilizing a fast neuroimaging technique, we investigated the effects of four different paced respiratory conditions on CSF oscillations. Our findings indicate that all paced respiratory conditions resulted in increased CSF oscillatory power and BOLD global signal amplitude, factors previously associated with increased CSF pulsations. Additionally, we observed that, compared to rest, paced sighing at the 0.02-0.03 Hz frequency range significantly increased the coupling between CSF oscillations and the negative derivative of the BOLD signal. Our study provides a novel perspective on how the frequency of breathing can influence CSF oscillations during wakefulness.",

      "title": "Activation of the medial entorhinal cortex drives memory-guided navigation behavior",
      "content": "The cognitive map in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is essential for spatial memory and exhibits experience-dependent changes. Yet, it remains unclear whether MEC activation is sufficient to drive memory-guided navigation, precluding a causal link between the MEC and spatial memory. To address this gap, we examined and optogenetically manipulated MEC activity as mice navigated a virtual track for a water reward based on memory. During learning, spatial activity in the pre-reward region showed the highest consistency along the track and closely paralleled improvements in reward-predictive behaviors. This elevated pre-reward consistency was widespread across MEC neurons, rather than confined to a particular cell type, indicating a network-level representation supporting reward prediction. Strikingly, optogenetic activation of MEC at non-reward locations biased reward-predictive behaviors toward stimulation sites, but only when stimulation patterns were spatially consistent. Consistent stimulation also induced anticipatory reward-seeking before stimulation onset and this behavior gradually developed with repeated stimulation, reflecting memory formation for stimulation locations. Moreover, in animals that failed to learn the track well, consistent pre-reward activation, alone or combined with landmark activation, significantly enhanced their reward prediction. Thus, spatially consistent MEC activation underlies memory-guided reward prediction, supporting a causal role for the MEC in spatial memory.",

In developing mutant mouse brains, ectopic apical radial glia (aRG) progenitors were found outside the proliferative ventricular zone. The role of Eml1 in aRG is not precisely determined. Using proteomics and imaging approaches, we compared brain tissue from control and mutant mice and identified microtubule and organelle dysregulation. Eml1 influences the trafficking of organelles to different compartments of aRG, where they may be involved in local functions. Mitochondrial and polysome distribution are altered in mutant conditions. Indeed, Eml1 interacts with translational machinery, and downregulation of translation is observed in Eml1 mutant aRG translatome. Paradoxically, an upregulation of translation-related mRNAs is also observed. These data uncover an unprecedented function of Eml1 and associate novel subcellular mechanisms with severe heterotopia formation.",
