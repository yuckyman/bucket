      "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
      "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

      "title": "The Impact of Stimulation Parameters on Reaction Times Following Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation in the Lower Leg",
      "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

      "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
      "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

      "title": "Deep Learning-Based Saturation Compensation for High Dynamic Range Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging",
      "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

      "title": "The modulatory effect of evaluative valence on fear generalization in social anxiety: an SSVEP study",
      "content": "BackgroundSocial anxiety is characterized by excessive sensitivity and concern about social evaluation. While previous research has demonstrated attentional bias and fear generalization in socially anxious individuals, the neural mechanisms by which different evaluative valences modulate this process remain unclear.MethodThis study employed a fear generalization paradigm combined with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Fifty-one college students were recruited and divided into high (n = 25) and low (n = 26) social anxiety groups. A face-evaluation paradigm was used to record both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses during fear generalization.ResultsAt the behavioral level, the high social anxiety group showed a broader fear generalization gradient. Both groups demonstrated higher unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings under negative versus positive evaluation conditions. This effect manifested differently between groups: in the high social anxiety group, it was specific to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) and generalization stimulus 4 (GS4), whereas in the low social anxiety group, it was observed for generalization stimulus 1 (GS1). At the neural level, SSVEP results revealed enhanced visual cortical activation (Oz, PO8) in the high social anxiety group across all stimuli. The PO7 electrode specifically reflected a differential modulation by evaluative valence between the groups; this adaptive modulation was evident in the low social anxiety group but absent in the high social anxiety group.ConclusionThis study reveals that social anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of early visual hypervigilance. Critically, we provide neurophysiological evidence that a core deficit underlying this condition is an impaired ability to utilize positive evaluation to down-regulate this hypervigilance. These results redefine our understanding of the cognitive-neural mechanisms of social anxiety, shifting the focus toward deficits in the neural processing of positive social information, and suggest that interventions should aim to restore the adaptive processing of positive social feedback.",

      "title": "Monotonicity in graph theoretic summaries of fMRI data acquired during human learning",
      "content": "IntroductionBehavioral performance during associative learning typically improves monotonically; performance on each successive iteration of the task is no worse (and typically better) than on the previous one. It is unclear whether connectomic measures of brain function (from fMRI data acquired during learning) also increase monotonically. We used a well-established associative learning paradigm to test for the possible co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and connectomics.MethodsfMRI data were summarized using two distinct connectomic (i.e., graph theoretic) measures: (a) Betweenness Centrality (of nodes) and (b) Average Shortest Path Length (i.e., a measure of network efficiency) across the graph. To broaden our study\u2019s breath, in addition to healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f39), we extended the analyses to data collected in schizophrenia patients (n\u202f=\u202f49). Past studies show that although patients show deficits in learning (lower learning capacity), behavior does typically display monotonicity.ResultsWe observed robust evidence for monotonic changes in behavior at the group level, and in most participants regardless of group. Evidence for monotonic changes in graph theoretic summaries of the co-acquired fMRI data was less widespread and was in general, more evident in group level summaries (regardless of group).DiscussionThis modest co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and fMRI-based connectomics re-emphasizes what has long been suspected: the relationship between overt measures of behavioral competence and the co-acquired imaging signals is complex. This may be because psychological events (whether in the healthy brain, or in clinical populations like schizophrenia) emerge not from local activity in circumscribed brain regions, but rather from widely distributed activity across the brain. While well-defined mathematical concepts like monotonicity can anchor attempts to co-observe properties of change in overt behavior, and underlying brain signals, we suggest that the search for such relationships will remain a challenge.",

      "title": "TFANet: a temporal fusion attention neural network for motor imagery decoding",
      "content": "IntroductionIn the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), motor imagery (MI) classification is a critically important task, with the primary objective of decoding an individual's MI intentions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, MI decoding faces significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent complex temporal dependencies of EEG signals.MethodsThis paper proposes a temporal fusion attention network (TFANet), which aims to improve the decoding performance of MI tasks by accurately modeling the temporal dependencies in EEG signals. TFANet introduces a multi-scale temporal self-attention (MSTSA) mechanism that captures temporal variation in EEG signals across different time scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global features. Moreover, the model adaptively adjusts the channel weights through a channel attention module, allowing it to focus on key signals related to motor imagery. This further enhances the utilization of temporal features. Moreover, by integrating the temporal depthwise separable convolution fusion network (TDSCFN) module, TFANet reduces computational burden while enhancing the ability to capture temporal patterns.ResultsThe proposed method achieves a within-subject classification accuracy of 84.92% and 88.41% on the BCIC-IV-2a and BCIC-IV-2b datasets, respectively. Furthermore, using a transfer learning approach on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, a cross-subject classification accuracy of 77.2% is attained.ConclusionThese results demonstrate that TFANet is an effective approach for decoding MI tasks with complex temporal dependencies.",

      "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",
