      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding. The study provides proof-of-concept evidence for BSDS in auditory paradigms, showing the importance of attentional fluctuations and stimulus loudness in determining the strength and timing of neural speech tracking, with implications for the design of adaptive speech-enhancement strategies.",

      "title": "Characterization of vagus nerve active fibers during seizure in rats",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. Vagus nerve activity is known to be modulated by seizures; however, the types of fibers that are activated during seizures remain unknown. This work compares the electrical activity of the vagus nerve before, during, and after seizures in epileptic rats. Approach. Six rats experiencing pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy seizures and two rats under saline solution were investigated. Action potentials (AP) identified by template matching were sorted according to the fiber type they are deemed to originate from. AP templates were based on a 3D COMSOL simplified model of the vagus nerve. Model templates were established for fibers of different diameters based on histology. Correspondences are thus established based on specific fiber diameters. Main results. During seizures, an increase in the percentage of occurrence of APs was observed for 2 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm fibers, while a decrease was observed for 4 \u00b5m, 5\u20136 \u00b5m, and 7\u201311 \u00b5m fibers. This was not observed in the rat group under saline solution. The increase in smaller diameter sizes is believed to be linked to an increase in autonomic activity. Significance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of vagus nerve dynamics during epileptic seizures and highlight the potential of vagus nerve activity as a physiological marker for seizure detection and monitoring. This would be of particular interest in vagus nerve stimulation to control any closed-loop form of therapy. This work provides a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in epilepsy management.",

      "title": "Multitimescale Computation by Astrocytes",
      "content": "The basic computational unit of the brain has long been defined as the neuron. However, mounting evidence suggests that other cells, especially astrocytes, also perform computation. Here we demonstrate that cerebellar astrocytes decompose norepinephrine input into slow and fast calcium activities through differential adrenergic receptor engagement. During reward learning in mice, slow and fast activities selectively target distinct synaptic pathways. Causal manipulations reveal that slow 1-adrenergic signals maintain behavioral states and coordinate transitions, while fast 2-adrenergic signals govern event-triggered responses and reinforcement learning. Remarkably, an actor-critic neural network trained on a similar sequence task spontaneously recapitulates these multitimescale dynamics, suggesting astrocytes implement critic-like computations that evaluate states and modulate neuronal learning. These findings establish astrocytes as multilevel processors that transform univariate neuromodulatory inputs into multivariate, pathway-specific circuit control operating in parallel with neuronal processing.",
