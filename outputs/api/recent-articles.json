      "title": "SpotDMix: informed mRNA transcript assignment using mixture models",
      "content": "Unveiling the genetic profiles of spatially distinguished cells is an important aspect in many areas of brain research, as the genetic identity contains information about a cell's physiological properties and internal state. On top of this, knowledge of the genetic details of each cell can reveal structural organization within tissue. As image-based spatial transcriptomics moves toward applications in tissues with dense cellular packing, accurate assignment of detected mRNA transcripts (\"spots\") to correct segmented cells becomes increasingly difficult, rendering simple methods insufficient with many incorrect assignments to neighboring cells. Here we introduce SpotDMix, a statistical model for assigning spots to cells by modeling spots as coming from a mixture model of distributions matching segmented cell shapes, with assignment probabilities and shape parameters optimized using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Performance is assessed and compared against several simple methods in various scenarios on both surrogate data and larval zebrafish data. In all tested scenarios SpotDMix outperforms the simple methods on all evaluated metrics, including individual transcript assignment accuracy, total assigned number of spots per cell error and cell type classification. Further, SpotDMix produces a higher degree of exclusivity between genes which are known to not or rarely co-express.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
