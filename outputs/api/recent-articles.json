      "title": "Transferable CNN-based data mining approaches for medical imaging: application to spine DXA scans for osteoporosis detection",
      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

      "title": "Substantia nigra pars reticulata regulates prefrontal cortex via ventromedial thalamus",
      "content": "The ventromedial thalamus (VM) innervates layer 1 (L1) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to influence executive function and arousal. Thalamocortical (TC) cells in VM process inputs from cortex that are important for generating persistent activity in closed reciprocal loops. However, little is known about connectivity and influence of subcortical inputs to TC cells, and how they are routed through VM to circuits in the mPFC. Here we use anatomical tracing, electrophysiology, and optogenetics to investigate subcortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in mouse VM. We first characterize the morphology and physiology of TC cells in VM and determine their main subcortical input arises from substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). We then show how SNr inputs make strong inhibitory connections onto TC cells, which are mediated by GABAA receptors and effectively suppress action potential firing. Lastly, we utilize intersectional approaches to show how SNr inputs are channeled via TC cells in VM to engage specific inhibitory networks in L1 of mPFC. Together, our results indicate how subcortical inputs engage higher-order thalamus to influence the frontal cortex, highlighting differences from equivalent circuits in motor systems.",
