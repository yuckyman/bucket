      "title": "Epileptic encephalopathy-related Kv2.1 mutants impair channel clustering and membrane distribution but not neuronal excitability",
      "content": "The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1, which is encoded by the epileptic encephalopathy-associated gene KCNB1, is a primary driver of delayed-rectifier K+ currents in neurons. These currents contribute to high frequency firing by preventing depolarization block due to Na+ channel inactivation. Wild-type (WT) channels are localized at the soma, proximal dendrites and axons, forming large aggregates (clusters) via their C-terminal proximal restriction and clustering domain (PRC). This study investigates the biophysical and functional consequences of two C-terminal truncation mutations (Y529* and R579*), identified in patients with epileptic encephalopathy, which disrupt this critical clustering domain. Cluster formation was impaired, though not abolished, in neurons expressing mutated subunits together with endogenous WT subunits. Consistent with this clustering deficit, single-molecule imaging revealed altered channel dynamics, with WT channels remaining largely immobile, while mutated forms exhibited intermittent diffusion punctuated by transient immobilization events. This behavior was reproduced by diffusion-capture simulations considering channels with different number of PRC domains (i.e. with mutant subunits) and labile scaffolding interactions. Patch-clamp recordings revealed no significant difference in excitability between WT and mutant-expressing neurons. However, we observed increased firing in both conditions compared to non-transfected neurons. This suggests that Kv2.1 overexpression (for both WT and mutant channels) counterintuitively enhances neuronal excitability. Our data challenge a canonical role of this voltage-gated potassium channel in dampening neuronal firing, indicating that its overall expression level can be a critical and paradoxical driver of hyperexcitability.",

      "title": "Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in Parkinson's disease: Effects of age, sex, and body mass index in a large fluorodopa PET cohort",
      "content": "BACKGROUND. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligand [18F]fluorodopa detects reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in PD patients. Demographic factors such as sex and BMI are also associated with dopamine synthesis capacity. The combined contribution of demographic and clinical effects however remains elusive. It also remains unresolved how the dopamine synthesis capacity is correlated between striatal subregions and how the dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine receptor function across striatal regions are associated with each other in PD patients and healthy controls. MATERIAL, AIMS, AND METHODS. For this retrospective register-based study, we used baseline [18F]fluorodopa PET data acquired at the Turku PET Centre between the years 1988-2016 with three different scanners (Ecat 931, GE Advance, HRRT). The data included scans of 350 adult human subjects, including 132 healthy controls (65 males and 67 females), and 218 PD patients (134 males and 84 females). The primary aim was to simultaneously investigate the effects of PD, age, sex and BMI on regional dopamine synthesis capacity (influx rate constant Kiref quantified with Patlak) using Bayesian linear regression. Secondary aims were to assess interregional correlations of dopamine synthesis capacity, and the association between regional presynaptic dopamine synthesis and postsynaptic dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) availability in subjects who also had a proximal [11C]raclopride PET scan. RESULTS. We found modest support for age-dependent decline in dopamine synthesis capacity, increased capacity for higher BMIs, and for higher capacity in females versus males. These effects were smaller than the effect of PD status. Dopamine synthesis capacity across regions was correlated in both patients and controls. Support for positive correlation between the synthesis capacity and the D2R was observed in caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS. PD and demographic effects are independently associated with the striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. The capacity is reduced by PD, decreased through age (particularly after the age of around 50), higher in females versus males, and weakly increased in higher BMIs. Synthesis capacity is correlated between the striatal and thalamic regions in both PD patients and controls. The dopamine synthesis capacity was positively correlated with the D2R availability in caudate. Scanner affects the estimates of dopamine synthesis capacity measured with [18F]fluorodopa PET, and it is preferrable to adjust for such variation in the data.",

      "title": "Generative enhancement of non-invasive dataset for motor brain-computer interface by task-relevant neural signals",
      "content": "Despite the increasing adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), developing high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems capable of decoding continuous movements, such as limb kinematics, remains a significant challenge. This difficulty stems from limited availability of task-specific neural features within individual neural signal datasets. To overcome this, we proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to enrich training features within neural signal datasets. Specifically, we synthesized artificial neural signal waveforms of the primary motor cortex (M1) from functionally related cortical regions, thereby enhancing neural datasets for improved motor kinematics decoding via DNN. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during goal-directed arm-reaching tasks, our results showed that enhancing individual datasets with GAN-synthesized M1 signals significantly improved decoding performance by about 10% (p < 0.05). Such improved performance is sustained even in the absence of real M1 signals. Our results highlight the potential of signal generative networks for improving and augmenting high DOF motor BCIs to achieve freely intended movements.",

      "title": "A Hybrid Knowledge- and Data-driven Model for Automatic Assessment of Chemically Induced Spiking Patterns in C-fiber Microneurography",
      "content": "Analyzing temporal spike patterns in nociceptors recorded via microneurography is challenging due to the use of a single recording electrode, waveform variability, and high similarity of spike shapes across neurons limiting interpretation of sensory coding such as pain and itch. We present a data-driven, supervised spike sorting approach to improve the analysis of nociceptive discharges, identified through activity-dependent conduction velocity changes. Our method integrates three feature sets and applies machine learning models including one-class SVM, SVM, and XGBoost. Validation used experimentally derived ground truth data acquired by controlled electrical stimulation, allowing precise spike time-locking. Compared to Spike2 software, our approach achieved higher F1-scores and reduced false positives, indicating improved spike sorting. Although XGBoost achieved the highest median F1-scores, optimal performance was dependent on individual combinations of feature sets and models for each recording. In some recordings with many nerve fibers and a low signal-to-noise ratio, reliable sorting was not feasible. This highlights the necessity to determine sortability and optimal configures using a ground truth protocol for each recording. These findings represent an important step toward reliable analysis of nociceptive activity. The openly accessible framework supports analyzing pruritogen-induced and spontaneous activity in neuropathic pain patients, advancing tools for peripheral neural decoding.",

      "title": "Long-term dynamic profiles of cognitive kinases induced by different learning protocols",
      "content": "Learning is associated with activation of multiple protein kinases, but few details are known about the activation dynamics in response to different learning protocols. We addressed this issue by examining the long-term dynamics of kinases critical for long term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse. Three serotonin (5-HT) protocols have been found to induce LTF with distinct effectiveness: the five-pulse regular-spaced Standard protocol; the five-pulse irregular-spaced Enhanced protocol; and the two-pulse protocol with an interval of 45 min. We previously compared long-term dynamics of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK after these protocols. Here we examined the long-term dynamics of additional kinases critical for LTF: p38 MAPK, protein kinase A (PKA), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). All four kinases showed complex dynamics of activity during 24 h, with a first wave of increase occurring shortly after 5-HT treatment and ending within 5 h, and a second wave from ~ 5 h to 18 h. After the Standard and two-pulse protocols, all kinase activities returned towards basal at 24 h, but after the Enhanced protocol some remained elevated at 24 h. Interactions and multiple feedback loops among the kinase pathways, and with the growth factors Aplysia neurotrophin (NT) and transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}), contribute to development of molecular clocks underlying these complex dynamics. These results help to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of LTF and provide insights that may help design improved training protocols for induction and maintenance of LTF and long-term memory.",

      "title": "Examining oculomotor behavior in central vision loss with a gaze-contingent display",
      "content": "Patients with central vision loss due to macular degeneration (MD) must rely on their peripheral vision for tasks normally performed by the fovea. Many patients develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), an eccentric retinal location used as a substitute for the damaged fovea in tasks such as face recognition, navigation, and reading. However, the mechanisms underlying PRL development remain elusive, and no single hypothesis fully explains its characteristics. Investigations into PRL development are hindered by oculomotor assessments, which often focus on fixation ability while neglecting other eye movement characteristics and potentially conflating different behaviors over time. In previous work, we introduced a series of oculomotor metrics in cases of simulated central vision loss, demonstrating that complex profiles of eye movement behavior can be extracted from a simple visual task. Here we present longitudinal data from 10 patients with MD as evidence of the feasibility of using these metrics to characterize different profiles of eye movements following central vision loss. Consistent with findings in healthy individuals using artificial scotoma, the metrics reveal substantial individual differences in behavior, both at baseline and after visual training. Overall, patients exhibit significantly higher saccadic re-referencing than controls, despite larger inter-individual differences. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss and offer a valuable tool for assessing progress in training protocols.",

      "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",

      "title": "MicroRNA-21-3p regulation of NOX4 and VEGFA contributes to hemorrhage in cerebral cavernous malformations",
      "content": "Objective: MicroRNAs regulate the brain vascular integrity and are involved in the lesion development of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). This study examines the role of microRNA-21-3p in CCM-related cerebral hemorrhage and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of miRNA-21-3p and its target genes of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and pericytes were assessed in cavernous malformation lesions of 20 sporadic CCM patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The association of their expression with hemorrhage manifestation was evaluated. Cell proliferation, permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), migration, tubule formation, and the expression of NOX4 and VEGFA were assessed in CCM2 gene-depleted human BMECs and pericytes after miRNA-21-3p intervention. Cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, and angiogenesis after miRNA-21-3p intervention were evaluated in the ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Results: Decreased miRNA-21-3p and increased NOX4 and VEGFA were shown in BMECs and pericytes of the CCM lesions compared to peri-lesion normal vessels from epilepsy patients, which were also correlated with the presence of cerebral hemorrhage in CCM patients. Increasing miRNA-21-3p attenuated cell proliferation, permeability, ROS expression, cell migration, and tubule formation by targeting NOX4 and VEGFA in CCM2 gene-depleted BMECs and pericytes. In vivo studies revealed that increasing miRNA-21-3p reduced cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, angiogenesis, and the overexpression of nox4 and vegfa in ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Conclusion: MiRNA-21-3p can be a novel therapeutic target by regulating NOX4 and VEGFA, thereby stabilizing vascular integrity and reducing cerebral hemorrhage in CCM lesions.",

      "title": "The alternated brain states in resting state after immoral decisions",
      "content": "Immoral decisions, which engage both cognitive control and reward system, bring both cognitive and neural consequences. However, how dishonesty has an impact on the brain's dynamic alterations is still unclear. In this work, we attempt to understand the impact of immoral decisions on the brain states' dynamics using both resting-state and task-state fMRI data collected before, during, and after an information-passing task involving dishonest choices with rewards. We employed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the changes in the brain dynamics state, in which the changes that happen between pre- and post-task are hypothesized to be linked to behavior and brain dynamics during the task. First, we identified 4 intrinsic brain states across both resting scans and task scans, including one reward state (state 1) and one control network (state 3). The fractional occupancy (FO) of the control network decreased after the task, and subsequent analysis showed that it was linked to brain dynamics during the task: as dishonesty persisted, FO of the control network decreased while FO of the reward network increased. Moreover, the post-task control network was negatively correlated with motivated dishonesty, suggesting that stronger control network recruitment counteracts immoral tendencies. In contrast, early in the task, the reward network positively correlated with motivated dishonesty, indicating that the representation and sensitivity to reward attribution were tied to dishonest choices. A complementary analysis using drift diffusion modeling confirmed that the reward network tracked the weightings placed on monetary rewards, and the level of activation of the reward network before the task is associated with a bias in dishonesty. Together, these findings suggest that the 'post-moral decision brain' operates not as a static system but as a set of dynamically shifting states, whose adaptive trajectories may underlie the lasting effect of moral erosion during sustained dishonest behavior.",

      "title": "The Human Brain's Action Network Affinity",
      "content": "This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal connectome-based framework to characterize the human brain's action network, namely network affinity, moving beyond traditional static temporal connectivity measures by leveraging full functional connectivity profiles on large-scale neural wave dynamics. We applied this method to map the action network for the first time in a non-Western young adult cohort from the Chinese Human Connectome Project (CHCP). Our results delineate the action network's detailed functional affinity architecture, capturing its integrative topology across the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical nuclei, and its characteristic anticorrelation with the default network. All the findings are replicated in HCP samples. Crucially, all derived high-resolution action network affinity maps and the associated computational code are publicly shared to foster open science and reproducibility (https://ccndc.scidb.cn/en). This work provides a foundational atlas and a new analytical approach, establishing a critical resource for future basic research across diverse populations and lifespans. It also holds significant translational potential for understanding and treating neurological and psychiatric disorders affecting goal-directed behavior, such as apathy and Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "Intravenous Administration of Serotonergic Psychedelics Produce Short-lasting Changes in Sleep-Wake Behavior and High Gamma Functional Connectivity in Rats",
      "content": "Background and Purpose: Given the increase in recreational psychedelic use and ongoing efforts to explore psychedelics as therapeutic agents for mental health disorders, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of psychedelics such as psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on sleep-wake states, which share a bidirectional relationship with mental health. Here, we investigated the effects of intravenous psilocybin and DMT on sleep-wake states and EEG spectral power and functional connectivity in rats. Experimental Approach: Sprague Dawley rats (n=25, 13 male) were surgically instrumented to record high-density EEG (27 electrodes) and EMG during 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle after intravenous psilocybin (2.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg), DMT (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. The EEG/EMG data were scored in 4-second epochs into wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG spectral power and corticocortical coherence, a surrogate for functional connectivity, were computed in 12-second epochs. Key Results: Psilocybin and DMT delayed the onset of SWS and REM sleep, and caused a short-lasting increase in wakefulness and decrease in SWS. Psilocybin also produced a 1) decrease in REM sleep, 2) decrease in theta power and coherence and increase in high gamma power and coherence during wake and SWS, and 3) increase in high gamma coherence during REM sleep. DMT increased gamma coherence only during wakefulness. Conclusions and Implications: Serotonergic psychedelics have minimal effects on sleep-wake states. The enhanced high gamma functional connectivity suggests that the psychedelic-induced changes in EEG/neural dynamics can occur independent of the arousal states.",

      "title": "Developmental CA2 perineuronal net reduction restores social memory in Shank3B KO mice",
      "content": "Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental conditions, like Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS), exhibit social recognition deficits. Previous reports using Shank3B knockout (KO) mice, a genetic model with relevance to ASD and PMDS, revealed deficits in social memory in adulthood, but the postnatal onset and mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. In the hippocampus, area CA2 contributes to the emergence of social memory during development and remains important for this ability through the lifespan. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, support social memory in CA2 and help orchestrate critical periods of plasticity in other brain regions. We found that Shank3B KO pups exhibit specific deficits in short-term social recognition and social novelty preference, which become evident at the end of the second postnatal week and persist into adulthood along with CA2 network aberrations. Excessive PNNs in area CA2 were detected in KO pups at the postnatal time when social recognition function typically emerges in healthy pups. This time was also characterized by greater sequestration of the guidance cue semaphorin-3A (sema3A) and overgrowth of afferents from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in KOs, suggesting that inordinate PNNs during a sensitive period may disorganize developing CA2 circuitry. Reduction of CA2 PNN levels prior to the onset of social dysfunction recovered social recognition function during development, as well as reduced sema3A and SuM inputs to the CA2. The restoration of behavioral function persisted into adulthood along with partial normalization of CA2 network activity. Together, these findings reveal how excess PNN formation in the developing hippocampus may give rise to impaired social memory by disrupting afferent input, effects that are reversible by early life intervention.",
