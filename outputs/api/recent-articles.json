      "title": "Long-term Effects of Early Life Adversity On Brain Dopamine and Serotonin Receptor Systems Involved In Cocaine Reinforcement In Adult Macaques: a Positron Emission Tomography study",
      "content": "Early life adverse (ELA) experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT) are associated with physical and mental illness, including substance use disorders (SUDs), but underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined long-term effects of infant MALT on adult brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in reward and emotional control, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a translational infant MALT macaque model of cocaine use disorder (CUD) risk and a COC self-administration (SA) paradigm. The study focused on regional serotonin 5HT1A, 5HT2A, and dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability (BP) differences between MALT and Control animals using PET, both at baseline (pre-COC SA) and following chronic COC SA (once they reached a total of 100 mgCOC/kg bodyweight intake). We also examined whether levels of these neurochemical receptors predicted COC SA measures, including reinforcing properties and potency using fixed-ratio (FR) peak response rates (RR) and progressive-ratio (PR) peak breakpoint. Our findings showed long-term effects of infant MALT on 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic circuits. Specifically, MALT animals showed lower 5HT1A BP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus compared to Controls. A MALT by Sex interaction effect was detected in 5HT2A BP in the OFC, with lower levels in MALT than Control males, but not in females. In addition, upregulation of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors was detected following chronic COC SA in most PFC subregions, hippocampus, and NAcc, particularly in the Control group. These findings suggest long-term effects of ELA on adult 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in emotional and reward processes. We also found associations between PET baseline (pre-COC SA) receptor BP data and COC SA measures; in particular, a positive correlation between 5HT1A receptor BP in caudate and FR Response Rates, whereas amygdala 5HT1A receptor levels were positively correlated with PR peak breakpoint and negatively correlated with and FR Response Rates. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of 5HT1A and 5HT2A PFC receptors in early COC-related changes in reward circuitry and of amygdala 5HT receptors on reward motivated behaviors. The dynamic change of these 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors following chronic COC exposure was blunted in animals with ELA. It would be important to understand the biological consequences of the dynamic changes in these 5HT receptors and whether they predict risk for COC relapse and can inform future pharmacological interventions that target 5HT receptors for treatment of CUD.",

      "title": "Multilayer Network Modelling of the Human Reading System",
      "content": "Reading is supported by rapid and flexible coordination of neural activity across distributed brain regions. We have previously shown that left fusiform gyrus (FusG) provides a bridge flexibly linking the visual form analysis required for reading with the language system. Here, we investigate the dynamic organisation of an extending reading network encompassing classical perisylvian language areas and FusG. We do so by applying multilayer network modelling to language fMRI data acquired through the Australian Epilepsy Project, using a paradigm that contrasts reading with visuospatial judgements. The dataset included 201 participants with left dominant language, both with and without seizure disorders. We hypothesised that the relative strength of dynamic interactions within this extended language network is associated with reading ability. Time resolved functional connectivity was estimated using a sliding window Pearson's correlation approach, and the resulting connectivity matrices were entered into a multilayer community detection algorithm to quantify spatiotemporal community structure within the reading network. We concentrate our analyses on allegiance, the probability that a pair of regions is assigned to the same community over time. Our results show that community structure within the reading network is characterised by a preference for within hemisphere assignment over cross hemisphere assignment, as well as higher nodal allegiance among left language regions compared with their right hemisphere homologues. As anticipated, within versus between network allegiance followed a similar gradient in both language and attention networks: lowest between left language and right attentional regions, intermediate between the left FusG and each respective network, and highest within-network (left language or right attention). Importantly, as hypothesised, reading ability was associated with FusG-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) interactions: higher left FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with better reading performance, whereas increased right FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with poorer reading. These findings highlight hemispheric asymmetries in the dynamic organisation of the reading system and provide novel evidence linking individual differences in reading ability to network level dynamics. Our findings align with a developmental literature suggesting that as reading proficiency improves, there is a shift from bilateral to unilateral left occipitotemporal engagement.",

      "title": "Latent biophysical diffusion properties underlying cerebral microstructure revealed through multimodal MRI covariation in the squirrel monkey",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI provides multiple quantitative descriptors of neural tissue derived from distinct physical and biophysical models, each probing different aspects of cerebral microstructure. While these metrics are often interpreted independently, their joint statistical structure may encode information about latent biophysical properties that constrain and organize brain microarchitecture. Here, we investigate whether stable patterns of multimodal diffusion MRI covariation reveal underlying biophysical diffusion properties of cerebral microstructure in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Using a high-resolution multimodal diffusion MRI dataset acquired at 11.7T (400 m isotropic resolution) from 15 adult subjects, we analyzed tensor-based metrics alongside advanced multicompartment and axonal models, including NODDI and ActiveAx. Voxelwise and region-level correlation analyses were performed across multiple spatial scales to examine the structure, redundancy, and stability of relationships among diffusion-derived maps. We show that metrics originating from conceptually distinct models consistently organize into a low-dimensional structure characterized by stable clusters of covariation, robust to changes in parcellation and spatial aggregation. These patterns cannot be explained by trivial metric redundancy alone, but instead suggest convergence toward a reduced set of effective biophysical degrees of freedom governing diffusion behavior in neural tissue, including axonal organization, neurite density, orientation dispersion, and isotropic diffusion components. We interpret these covariation structures as manifestations of latent biophysical diffusion properties, emergent tissue states that are not directly observable through any single metric but become apparent through their structured relationships. From a systems neuroscience perspective, the stability of these latent dimensions supports the view that adult cerebral microstructure reflects the steady-state outcome of neurodevelopmental dynamics operating under biophysical constraints. Rather than providing a regional atlas, this work proposes a conceptual framework for interpreting multimodal diffusion MRI as a projection of an underlying low-dimensional biophysical state space organizing cerebral microstructure in primate brains.",

      "title": "Dopamine signatures of excessive and compulsive cocaine and fentanyl use",
      "content": "Excessive and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of substance use disorder, yet individuals differ markedly in their vulnerability to develop these behaviors. Drugs of abuse are long known to alter endogenous dopamine (DA) signaling, but shared principles for how DA dynamics impact compulsive use among individuals and across drug classes are lacking. Here, we monitored DA release in the medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) during cocaine and fentanyl self-administration, with or without coincident punishment, in large cohorts of mice. Contingent cocaine and fentanyl self-administration evoked complex and individually distinct DA dynamics; nevertheless, a robust negative correlation held across both drugs, such that high takers exhibited lower drug-evoked DA signals. During punished drug taking, cocaine and fentanyl cases were associated with distinct DA signatures of compulsivity. For cocaine, punishment-resistant mice showed lower sustained DA responses during the post-shock, drug-associated cue period, whereas for fentanyl, punishment-resistant mice displayed larger phasic DA at the co-occurrence of footshock and drug infusion. To identify common principles underlying these observations, we developed a computational model grounded in an Actor-Critic temporal-difference (TD) learning framework that incorporates internal states, agent's uncertainty, and drug-specific effects. Remarkably, this model captures the observed diversity in DA dynamics across drug classes and among mice with variable drug taking propensities, hereby providing a unified interpretation of NAc DA signals as encoding TD reward prediction errors.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

It is possible to download\nall files in a zip folder that will be called \u2018osfstorage-archive.zip\u2019 when\ndownloaded. But as the OSF supports a nested folder structure, you might miss a\nfolder, and you will quickly end up with \u2018osfstorage-archive (1).zip\u2019, \u2018osfstorage-archive\n(2).zip\u2019, etc. Unzipping these archives creates a lot of files without the\norganized folder structure, in folders with meaningless names, making it\ndifficult to understand where files are. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The\nosf_file_download function in Papercheck </span></b></h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have added\na new function to our R package \u2018<a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>\u2019 that will download all files and\nfolders in an OSF repository.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
