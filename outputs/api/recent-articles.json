      "title": "State dependent shifts in large scale functional topographies",
      "content": "Although functional networks can be consistently identified across cognitive states, they also undergo dynamic reconfigurations across different contexts. For example, naturalistic movie watching paradigms amplify activity in sensory systems compared to resting conditions. However, it remains unclear how these different states affect large-scale brain organization. The current study leveraged high-resolution in vivo 7T fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Precision NeuroImaging (PNI) datasets to examine large scale functional connectivity changes between resting and movie-watching conditions. To understand these changes within topographic and geometric principles of brain organization, connectivity shifts were stratified relative to macroscale cortical hierarchy and geodesic distance. Our results revealed that primary sensory areas showed increased local connectivity and reduced long-range interactions during movie watching relative to resting conditions, whereas the default mode network (DMN) exhibited an opposing pattern characterized by reduced within-network long-range connectivity and enhanced connectivity with distant regions outside the DMN. Together, these findings demonstrate that different cognitive states involve geometry- and hierarchy-informed reorganization of large-scale functional networks.",

      "title": "Synchrony-driven Assemblies Reliably Represent Complex Stimuli in Ferret Auditory Cortex",
      "content": "Neuronal assemblies defined by coordination at high temporal resolution are thought to act as functional modules for information processing throughout the brain. Here, we develop a new method for identifying these assemblies from analytical tests of pairwise synchrony, benefiting from three rigorous criteria for assembly detection and sensitivity to rare but significant coordinated firing patterns. Following validation through simulations and in vivo recordings, we perform synchrony-based analysis on datasets from both primary (A1) and non-primary (PEG) ferret auditory cortex during passive listening to complex natural sounds. We show that synchrony-driven assemblies (SDAs) in both areas exhibit regular temporal dynamics, including the production of stereotypical spike sequences. In-keeping with their enhanced inter-neuronal reliability, SDAs are observed to outperform random assemblies in two versions of rate-based decoding. We extend these results to temporal decoding, and consistently observe optimal integration windows of 10-20ms. Thus, we suggest that SDAs are sufficient for the accurate representation of diverse sets of complex auditory stimuli, and that this increase in information depends entirely on coordination at very fine temporal scales.",

      "content": "Theories of the neural mechanism underpinning rapid recognition debate whether it relies solely on a feedforward sweep through the ventral stream or instead requires recurrent processing, possibly engaging additional brain regions. Here we directly tested the \"adaptive recurrence hypothesis\", that attempts to unify these disparate views by proposing that additional recurrent cortical resources beyond the visual stream are recruited when feedforward processing alone is insufficient to solve object recognition. To investigate this hypothesis, we contrasted functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) responses to compare neural responses to images that are equally well recognized by humans, but that differ in whether they could be solved by a feedforward deep neural network; a computational proxy for ventral stream feedforward processing. We found that when feedforward processing in the ventral visual stream is insufficient, additional parieto-frontal networks are rapidly and transiently recruited, representationally reconfiguring the ventral visual stream. Our results reveal that object recognition flexibly adapts through fast, cortex-wide recurrence, providing a unifying framework for competing theories of visual recognition.",

      "title": "Improved inference of latent neural states from calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Calcium imaging (CI) is a standard method for recording neural population activity, as it enables simultaneous recording of hundreds-to-thousands of individual somatic signals. Accordingly, CI recordings are prime candidates for population-level latent variable analyses, for example using models such as Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and latent dynamical systems. However, these models have been primarily developed and fine-tuned for electrophysiological measurements of spiking activity. To adapt these models for use with the calcium signals recorded with CI, per-neuron fluorescence time-traces are typically either de-convolved to approximate spiking events or analyzed directly under Gaussian observation assumptions. The former approach, while enabling the direct application of latent variable methods developed for spiking data, suffers from the imprecise nature of spike estimation from CI. Moreover, isolated spikes can be undetectable in the fluorescence signal, creating additional uncertainty. A more direct model linking observed fluorescence to latent variables would account for these sources of uncertainty. Here, we develop accurate and tractable models for characterizing the latent structure of neural population activity from CI data. We propose to augment HMM, GPFA, and dynamical systems models with a CI observation model that consists of latent Poisson spiking and autoregressive calcium dynamics. Importantly, this model is both more flexible and directly compatible with standard methods for fitting latent models of neural dynamics. We demonstrate that using this more accurate CI observation model improves latent variable inference and model fitting on both CI observations generated using state-of-the-art biophysical simulations as well as imaging data recorded in an experimental setting.",

      "title": "Preemptive SOD1 Silencing via Neonatal Intramuscular AAV Therapy Modifies Disease Trajectory in an ALS Mouse Model",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Mutations in SOD1 are a leading genetic cause of familial ALS, driving motor neuron degeneration through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. While gene silencing strategies targeting SOD1 hold therapeutic promise, their clinical translation has been hindered by inefficient delivery to the spinal cord and safety concerns associated with conventional viral vectors. Here, we report a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 suppression. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended survival, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA platform demonstrated a superior safety profile compared to shRNA-based constructs, which caused severe toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice. Our study establishes neonatal intramuscular delivery of rAAV2-retro-miRNA as a safe, efficient, and clinically translatable strategy for preemptive intervention in SOD1-mediated ALS, with broad implications for the treatment of other motor neuron diseases.",

      "title": "Paw switching with lateralized cholinergic modulation",
      "content": "Motor preferences, such as handedness, reflect fundamental asymmetries in brain function and behavior across vertebrate species, including humans and rodents1. Although individual hand or paw preferences are typically stable, they can be reshaped through experience or training, underscoring the plasticity of lateralized motor circuits2. However, the neural mechanisms that enable this behavioral switching remain unclear. Here we show that experience-driven shifts in paw preference in mice arise from asymmetric cholinergic modulation between the two hemispheres. Using a behavioral paradigm designed to induce paw switching, we found that a subset of animals developed a stable change in preference following training. Selective activation or inhibition of cholinergic neurons on one side of the brain was sufficient to bias this switching behavior. During lateralized movements, an endogenous imbalance in cholinergic activity emerges between the hemispheres, suggesting that interhemispheric cholinergic asymmetry enables motor flexibility. These findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which cholinergic signaling dynamically regulates lateralized motor control, providing insight into how hemispheric imbalances may shape persistent individual motor preferences.",

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a strategy-based cognitive training program (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training) to improve executive function and related outcomes in young women with stroke.MethodsEight women with chronic-stage stroke (age: M = 38.75 years; SD = \u00b1 8.78) and eight age- and education-matched controls (age: M = 35.75 years; SD \u00b1 7.71) completed 10 sessions of SMART over 5 weeks, with pre- and post- training assessments. Outcomes included measures of executive function (subtests of the BrainHealth Index), daily living skills (Cognitive Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Daily Living Questionnaire, and Community Integration Questionnaire), and psychosocial functioning (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21), as well as feasibility/goodness of fit of the program (Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure).ResultsFollowing SMART, participants with stroke demonstrated improvements in aspects of executive function (including abstraction, strategic memory, and fluency of ideas), cognitive self-efficacy, and stress.

Previous behavioral research has shown that editing density affects temporal judgments. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship, we examined the role of motor system activity, specifically the supplementary motor area (SMA), in time perception when individuals are exposed to moving images with different cinematographic editing styles. Forty-eight university students were assigned to one of three tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, or sham). They viewed nine silent video clips with different editing styles (master shot, slow-paced, fast-paced) that were specifically created for research. The participants rated perceived duration, time passage, action speed, and emotional engagement, while tDCS was applied for 20 min targeting the SMA. The results revealed that SMA excitability modulation affected duration estimates, time passage, and action speed judgments by interacting with the editing style of the clips. These findings highlight the importance of the SMA in modulating time perception during film viewing. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms that shape the viewer\u2019s perception of film time as an integral part of experiencing movement in cinema.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "E-Sort: empowering end-to-end neural network for multi-channel spike sorting with transfer learning and fast post-processing",
      "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",
