      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
      "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
      "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Epilepsy-associated Variants of a Single SCN1A Codon exhibit Divergent Functional Properties",
      "content": "Objective: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A, which encodes the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.1, are associated with multiple epilepsy syndromes exhibiting a range of clinical severity. Loss or gain of function SCN1A variants are reported in different syndromes including Dravet syndrome, which is associated with loss-of-function whereas neonatal/infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is associated with gain-of-function. Strategies to predict SCN1A variant pathogenicity and dysfunction have been proposed but are limited by available training data. We investigated the functional properties of four epilepsy-associated SCN1A variants affecting the same codon and sought to correlate channel dysfunction with phenotype. Methods: Whole-cell manual patch-clamp recording was performed on heterologously-expressed NaV1.1 variants. Structural modeling of NaV1.1 variant proteins was conducted using AlphaFold 3. Results: We describe an individual with early infantile onset DEE associated with SCN1A-I1347T, and identified three additional cases from the literature or ClinVar with distinct variation of the same codon (I1347N, I1347V, I1347F). Functional studies demonstrated mixed gain and loss of function properties for I1347T, I1347V, and I1347F, but complete loss-of-function for I1347N. Structural models suggest important interactions between isoleucine-1347 and the sixth transmembrane helices of domains 3 and 4 that are disrupted most significantly with asparagine replacement at this position (I1347N). Interpretation: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A involving the same codon can produce divergent functional effects. Our findings suggest that predicting specific functional effects of SCN1A variants should not rely heavily on position in the protein.",

      "title": "Activation of CP-AMPARs is required for homosynaptic and heterosynaptic structural LTP in the hippocampus",
      "content": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves alterations in synaptic structure that are believed to underlie the persistent increase in synaptic efficacy. Here we compared structural LTP (sLTP) in EGFP-labelled spines with functional LTP, using field potential recording, at CA3-CA1 synapses in mouse hippocampal slices for ~ 2 h following theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Activity-dependent labelling with FM4-64 allowed us to compare activated (FM+) and non-activated synapses and thereby compare homo- and hetero-synaptic sLTP. In addition, we related spine volume changes according to the probability of release, P(r), of activated synapses. At homosynaptic sites there was the expected NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent potentiation of spine volume that persisted throughout the recording period. We found that this sLTP also required the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs. There was also sLTP at heterosynaptic sites that, surprisingly, developed more quickly than the associated homosynaptic sLTP. This heterosynaptic sLTP was also dependent on the synaptic activation of both NMDARs and CP-AMPARs. Additionally, we observed a trans- and hetero-synaptic interaction, whereby the heterosynaptic spines grew according to the P(r) of the neighbouring active (homosynaptic) synapse. These observations have therefore advanced our understanding of sLTP in several ways; the first demonstration of the absolute requirement for the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs for sLTP; the magnitude of heterosynaptic sLTP relative to homosynaptic sLTP and the hitherto unexpected combination of trans- and hetero-synaptic interactions.",

      "content": "The top-down influence of working memory (WM) can manifest as attentional capture and a \"tinted lens\" that alters perceptual appearance. Yet it remains unclear whether these effects arise from a common mechanism or reflect functionally and mechanistically distinct processes. Across two experiments, we embedded a perceptual estimation task during WM maintenance. Hierarchical Bayesian mixture modeling revealed robust bidirectional attraction between memory and perception. More importantly, time-resolved analyses of mouse trajectories showed that attentional capture emerged as a fast, transient deviation linked to movement initiation, whereas perceptual bias reflected a slower, sustained shift shaping the final perceptual judgment. Notably, the prospective influence of WM on perception engaged both effects, whereas the retrospective influence of perception on WM involved only the sustained shift. These findings indicate that WM deploys distinct top-down signals that operate over different timescales to dynamically shape our perceptual experience.",

      "title": "Investigating the Contribution of Molecular-Enriched Functional Connectivity to Brain-Age Analysis",
      "content": "Brain-age prediction from neuroimaging data provides a proxy of biological aging, yet most models rely on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a modality that captures macroanatomy but offers limited biological specificity. We tested whether integrating molecular-enriched functional connectivity (FC), from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, improves brain-age prediction and biological explainability. We analyzed MRI data of 2,120 healthy adults (1,243/877 F/M; 18 -90 years) from three public datasets. Molecular-enriched connectivity maps were derived with Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) using receptor-density templates for the dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) transporter systems. Support vector regression models were applied to predict chronological age from molecular-enriched FC, structural morphometry, or both combined. The effect of multi-site variability was mitigated via ComBat harmonization with and without Empirical Bayes pooling. We additionally conducted a common-parcellation analysis to assess the impact of differing parcellations between modalities. Single-transporter molecular-enriched FC explained up to 51% of age variance. The most predictive transporter varied by dataset, with DAT dominating in the harmonized and common-parcellation settings. Combining the three molecular-enriched maps consistently improved prediction over any single map and increased explained variance up to 64%. In the merged multi-site cohort using a common parcellation, augmenting structural information with transporter-enriched FC reduced mean absolute error (MAE) from 6.02 to 5.81 years, supporting complementarity of the two modalities. In contrast, when different parcellations were applied, incorporating molecular-enriched FC into brain age prediction resulted in a 2% higher MAE compared to structural morphometry alone, suggesting that parcellation mismatch may obscure the functional contributions. In conclusion, molecular-enriched FC is a feasible and biologically informative extension to brain-age modeling, enhancing prediction and interpretability with respect to neurotransmitter systems.",

After learning a motor sequence task while their brain activity was recorded with MEG, participants were distributed in two groups according to whether they slept or were totally sleep deprived during the first post-training night. Consolidation was assessed with a retest in the MEG three days after training. Behaviorally, performance improved over the consolidation interval irrespective of whether sleep was afforded during the first night. MEG results showed that initial motor sequence learning was characterized by a progressive decrease in beta Event Related Desynchronization (ERD, 18-25Hz) over bilateral motor areas. Interestingly, while these practice-related modulations of beta ERD were not influenced by the sleep status, post-learned-movement beta Event Related Synchronization (ERS) over bilateral parietal areas increased over the consolidation interval in the sleep, compared to the sleep deprived, group. These results extend current models of motor memory consolidation by identifying ERS as an oscillatory marker of sleep-dependent consolidation.",

      "title": "Evaluating oscillatory mechanisms underlying flexible neural communication in the human brain",
      "content": "How the brain orchestrates the flow of information between its multiple functional units flexibly, quickly, and accurately, remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple theories identify neural oscillations as a likely basis for this process. However, a lack of empirical validation of proposed theories, particularly at the whole-brain scale, has hampered consensus on oscillatory principles governing neural communication, limiting our understanding of a process central to perception and cognition and its integration into experiments and clinical applications. Here, we empirically validate previously proposed neural-oscillatory communication mechanisms in the human brain - specifically those involving power and interareal phase coherence - at the whole-brain scale. We do this by estimating the dependence of inferred communication on oscillatory measures that have been theorised to facilitate communication, in source-localised resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We find that power and phase coherence in the alpha, beta, and high-gamma bands track communication better than others. Crucially, the relation between communication and oscillatory measures varied across regions, indicating spatial heterogeneity in routing mechanisms. Notably, power and coherence-based principles tracked communication patterns of unimodal regions better than those of transmodal regions. In sum, these findings suggest that the human brain implements regionally specific communication mechanisms with complex neural-oscillatory dependence.",

      "content": "IntroductionPerinatal brain injury is a leading cause of cerebral palsy. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) provides a non-invasive method for investigating motor pathway development; however, data on the safety and feasibility of its repeated use in infants are limited. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of spTMS in infants with perinatal brain injury.MethodsTwenty infants with perinatal brain injury (corrected age 3\u201325 months) participated in 46 spTMS sessions while awake. Safety and tolerability were systematically assessed using heart rate, respiratory rate, and the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS). Feasibility was quantified by session completion, participant retention, and acquisition of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from bilateral wrist flexors.ResultsAcross 2,527 pulses, no adverse events occurred. Physiological measures and MBPS scores remained stable from pre- to post-stimulation. Analyzable electromyography (EMG) was obtained in 100% of sessions, with MEPs successfully elicited in 44/46 sessions (95.7%) across 19/20 infants (95%). A high longitudinal retention rate (85%) further demonstrated excellent protocol acceptability.DiscussionThese findings establish a safe, reproducible framework for longitudinal spTMS in a vulnerable infant population. This methodological advance enables future investigations into neuroplasticity and corticospinal tract development after early brain injury, with the potential to yield biomarkers that guide the timing and targets of early interventions.",

      "content": "Loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), a neurophysiological measure that reflects central serotonergic activity, is also influenced by the noradrenaline and dopamine systems. While it has been used in investigations of various psychiatric disorders, the fundamental characteristics in healthy individuals remain largely unknown. The present exploratory study examined 60 healthy adults to determine the associations of LDAEP with psychological traits assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The participants completed TCI and STAI questionnaires before undergoing electrophysiological recordings. LDAEP was measured based on the peak-to-peak amplitude slopes of P50/N100 and N100/P200 across five sound intensity levels. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, moderate negative correlations of LDAEP slopes with harm avoidance (HA) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) scores were noted. Additionally, sex-adjusted analysis showed novelty seeking to be positively associated with LDAEP. These findings suggest an association of LDAEP with individual differences in harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and novelty seeking in healthy adults. This supports the potential use of LDAEP as a non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder, as well as in anxiety-related conditions.",

      "title": "Endovascular management of tandem embolic stroke due to cardioembolic free-floating thrombus: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundTandem lesions (TLs), defined as simultaneous occlusions of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, represent a particularly challenging subset of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. While most TLs are attributed to atherosclerotic changes or arterial dissection, a smaller subset originates from cardioembolic emboli arising from the heart or aortic arch, commonly referred to as embolic tandem lesions. In rare instances, these emboli form a free-floating thrombus (FFT) in the carotid artery, characterized by mobile intraluminal thrombotic material with high embolic potential. Optimal treatment strategies for these rare and complex cases remain undefined.Case summaryWe present a rare case involving an embolic tandem lesion in a 73-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke upon awakening. Imaging and angiography demonstrated a free-floating thrombus (FFT) at the brachiocephalic bifurcation extending into the origins of the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, a free-floating thrombus at the carotid bifurcation, and an additional thrombus occluding the right ICA terminus and the origin of the M1 segment. A staged endovascular approach was employed: intracranial recanalization was first achieved via mechanical thrombectomy, followed by stent-assisted stabilization of the residual free-floating thrombus within the common carotid artery. The patient experienced significant neurological improvement and attained functional independence at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity associated with embolic tandem lesions and carotid FFT involvement. Comprehensive preprocedural imaging, including assessment of the aortic arch and cervical vessels, is critical. A personalized, multi-modality endovascular approach combining thrombectomy and stenting can enable successful revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly when FFT complicates tandem occlusions.",
