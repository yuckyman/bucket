      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.
