      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "Invariant activity sequences across the mouse brain",
      "content": "An ambition of neuroscience is to identify fundamental patterns of neural activity that are shared across the brain. Such patterns may occur in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are coupled to the population and fire in 50-100 ms sequences. Here we show that these sequences are stable over time and ubiquitous across the brain. Chronic Neuropixels recordings in mouse visual cortex revealed that each neuron was coupled to the local population with a characteristic strength and delay. Stimulus responses formed a sequence where neuronal participation depended on tuning, but delay was fixed. This sequence interacted multiplicatively with the rate code, appeared even during spontaneous activity, and remained stable for weeks. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that the sequences occur across the entire mouse brain and are often synchronized across regions. These results reveal a stable scaffold for brainwide activity and suggest that the sequences support a canonical computation operating across the brain.",

      "title": "Ephaptic coupling can explain variability in neural activity",
      "content": "The waxing and waning cortical oscillatory power correlates with function and disease. This cross-trial variability has been thought to be due to neuromodulation, uncertainty encoding, and/or changes in cortical excitability. Here, we report evidence that it is also due to fluctuations in ephaptic influences of mesoscale electric fields. We analyzed LFP data from the PFC recorded during a spatial delay saccade task. We constructed a model that describes the electric field close to the cortical patch given the neural activity that generates it. This revealed that field-to-neuron interactions (ephaptic coupling strength) was stronger that neuron-to-field and it correlated trial by trial changes in oscillatory power. This suggests a form of circular causality where neural activity and extracellular electric fields continuously shape each other. These results further suggest that mesoscale ephaptic effects help drive the formation of memory ensembles, a prediction of the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis.",

      "title": "Probabilistic inference of Homonymous and Heteronymous Recurrent Inhibition in Human Muscles from Large-Scale Motor Neuron Recordings",
      "content": "Understanding how spinal circuits shape motor neuron behavior during muscle contractions remains a major challenge. Here, we combined large-scale motor unit recordings with simulation-based inference to generate probabilistic estimates of homonymous and heteronymous recurrent inhibition, a key spinal circuit that has remained mostly inaccessible during natural voluntary contractions. We constructed synchronization cross-histograms from motor neuron spike trains and extracted features representative of recurrent inhibition. Because these features are influenced by higher-frequency components of common synaptic input, we developed a simulation-based inference framework to disentangle these effects. Following validation, we applied this framework to experimental data from six muscles and two contraction intensities, revealing previously uncharacterized muscle- and intensity-dependent patterns: recurrent inhibition decreased with contraction intensity in most muscles but increased in the vastus lateralis and medialis. The pipeline is openly available and designed for reuse on comparable datasets and adaptation to diverse experimental contexts, including other spinal circuits.",

      "content": "Sensory dysfunction during aging results in sharp increases in the incidence of chronic itch and pain, which counterintuitively are associated with reduced sensitivity to light touch. While age-related changes in peripheral mechanosensory transmission have been described, the contribution central mechanisms make to altered itch and pain responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that signalling from cutaneous touch receptors is essential for maintaining the cellular composition of the central somatosensory circuits that process itch and pain information in adult mice. In particular, the loss of excitatory signalling from Merkel cells during aging causes the degeneration of subsets of molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, including inhibitory neurons that express the neuropeptide NPY. Our demonstration that the activity-dependent loss of inhibitory NPY neurons drives itch and pain hypersensitivity in old animals reveals the mechanism by which aging reconfigures the central neuronal circuits that sense touch, itch and pain.",

      "content": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has long been thought to shape calcium signals in neurons, but stimulus-driven ER calcium fluctuations have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure neuronal ER calcium signals in vivo, we paired visual stimulus presentation with two photon imaging of ER and cytosolic calcium reporters in four different cell types in the Drosophila visual system. We found that visual input elicits diverse ER calcium signals, with the ER acting as a calcium sink or source depending on the cell type, subcellular compartment (dendrite versus axon), and type of visual stimulus. ER calcium signals were not simply a reflection of cytosolic signals, indicating that the ER, rather than acting as a passive calcium buffer, actively processes calcium signals in neurons in a context-specific fashion. Thus, ER-based signal processing may contribute to functional diversity across neuronal cell types, thereby enhancing the computational capacity of neural circuits.",

      "title": "Single cell RNA sequencing reveals limited effects of Lrrk2 genotype in a mouse model of acute CNS inflammation",
      "content": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Previous data implicates neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Of the genes associated with PD, Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has previously been proposed to play a role in neuroinflammation. However, the extent to which LRRK2 is involved in endogenous inflammatory signaling is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous mutations in LRRK2 affect responses to neuroinflammation in vivo. METHODS: We injected cohorts of mice with knock-in mutations in Lrrk2, homologous to those causing human PD, with a single intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control. We used single cell RNA-Sequencing to examine cell type specific responses to treatment and genotype and validated key results with orthogonal approaches. RESULTS: We found that our chosen paradigm of acute LPS exposure evokes robust transcriptional changes consistent with a multicellular neuroinflammatory response. We also found evidence of peripheral immune cell recruitment into the brain and interaction with brain-resident microglia. However, the transcriptional effects of Lrrk2 mutations were limited to small numbers of genes, including down regulation of gene ontogeny terms related to lysosomes, in microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly demonstrate that many cells in the brain respond to a single inflammatory insult with strong transcriptional responses and that, even in a model focused on CNS injection, there is interaction between peripheral and central immune cells. In contrast, the quantitative effects of Lrrk2 mutations are modest at the transcriptional level, demonstrating that additional studies are needed to clarify whether Lrrk2 mutations affect neuroinflammation in an endogenous context.",

      "title": "Fast and slow learning mediated by distinct climbing fiber signals",
      "content": "Learning involving the cerebellum is primarily driven by climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells. While the encoding properties of these instructive signals have been characterized extensively in trained animals, it is unclear how they are shaped by learning across both slow and fast timescales. Here, we use longitudinal 2-photon calcium imaging to record the dynamics of climbing fiber inputs across multiple cerebellar lobules as mice learn to execute a visuomotor integration task - slow learning - and must then rapidly adapt to a new sensorimotor coupling - fast learning. Instructive signals are spatially segregated in trained mice: Lobule V preferentially encodes movement predictively, while Lobule simplex preferentially receives reward-related feedback. Moreover, the encoding of sensorimotor and reward-related instructive signals is dynamic on both slow and fast timescales: movement-related activity emerges over the course of training, while reward-related activity progressively diminishes as mice become experts but re-emerges specifically in Lobule simplex when rewards become scarce. Finally, while the same climbing fiber inputs can change on both timescales, the magnitude and spatial organization of slow changes are not related to fast changes. Thus, climbing fiber inputs convey common yet complementary instructive signals that are dynamically shaped by learning on multiple time scales through distinct processes.",

      "title": "Neocortical temporal patterning by a two-layered regulatory network",
      "content": "In the developing neocortex, a diverse array of neurons with defined types and abundances are systematically generated by a limited population of radial glial progenitors (RGPs) as they undergo successive fate changes. The molecular regulation behind this intricate temporal patterning remains elusive. We undertook in-depth single-cell multi-omics analyses, discovering a two-layered regulatory framework at the core of this process. Central to this are global temporal regulators positioned above a temporal network, consisting of series of transcriptional factor (TF) hub groups under sequential state transitions. This temporal network operates not by restricting TF expressions to discrete temporal windows, but through coordinated transcriptional and chromatin-accessibility dynamics that modulate transient TF regulatory activity. Moreover, global temporal regulators specify the duration of each cascading stage and, consequently, the number of progenies generated at each stage. Loss of global temporal regulators protracts RGP lineage progression, whereas their increased activity accelerates it. These findings suggest a two-layer temporal regulatory system controlling RGP lineage progression and neural progeny output duality in mammalian neocortical development.",

The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",
