      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "<p>I used the time over Christmas and in between the years to redesign my website.<p>This time I decided to make it in the theme of an evil Sith Lord that commands the Galactic Cookie Empire, because I found my previous cookie consent game a bit boring after a while.<p>Here's the website's welcome page and the cookie consent game: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/index.html</a><p>(the cookie consent game isn't started on any other page of my website, only on the welcome page)<p>I also made a \"making of\" weblog article series, in case you're interested in the development process and how I implemented it and what kind of troubles I went through already:<p>- Making of the Game: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website...</a><p>- Making of the Avatar: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website-part-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/making-of-my-website...</a><p>- Debuggers to toy around with: <a href=\"https://cookie.engineer/design/consent/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cookie.engineer/design/consent/index.html</a><p>It \"should\" work on modern browsers. I tested it on Firefox on Linuxes, Chrome/Chromium on Linuxes, and Safari on Macbook. Don't have an iPhone so I can't test that, but my two old Android phones were also working fine with the meta viewport hack (I can't believe this is still the \"modern\" way to do things after 15 years. Wtf).<p>Best experience is of course with a bigger display. On smaller screen sizes, the game will use a camera to zoom around the game world and follow the player's spaceship. Minimum window width is 1280 pixels for no camera, and I think 800 pixels to be playable (otherwise the avatar gets in the way too much in the boss fights).<p>Oh, there's also a secret boss fight that you can unlock when you toy around with the Dev Tools :)<p>What's left to do on the avatar animation side:<p>- I have to backport CMUdict to JavaScript / ECMAScript. That's what I'm working on right now, as I'm not yet satisfied with the timings of the phonemes. Existing tools and pipelines that do this in python aren't realtime, which leads to my next point.<p>- I want to switch to using the \"waveform energy detection\" and a zero cross rate detector to time phonemes more correctly. I believe that changes in waveforms and their structures can detect differences in phonemes, but it's a gut feeling and not a scientific fact. Existing phoneme animation papers were kind of shit and broken (see my making of article 2). The phoneme boundary detector is highly experimental though and is gonna need a couple weeks more time until it's finished.<p>That's it for now, hope you gonna enjoy your stay on my website and I hope you gonna have fun playing the Cookie Consent Game :)<p>Oh, also, because it might not be obvious: No LLMs were used in the making of this website. Pretty much everything is hand-coded, and unbundled and unminified on purpose so visitors can learn from the code if they want to.<p>~Cookie</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46436128\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46436128</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN \u2014<p>Tidy Baby is a new game made by me and Wyna Liu (of NYT Connections!) that is inspired by the legendary card-based game SET that we assume many of you love (we too love SET).<p>In SET, you\u2019ve got four dimensions: shape, number, color, and shading, each with three variants.<p>In Tidy Baby you only have to deal with three dimensions:<p>- word length (3, 4, or 5 letters)\n- part of speech (noun, verb, or adjective)\n- style (bold, underline, or italic)<p>Like in SET, you are trying to form sets of three cards where, along each dimension, the set is either all the same or all different. If you\u2019ve never played SET there are more details/examples at \u201chow to play\u201d in the game.<p>The mechanics of Tidy Baby are sort of inspired by a solitaire/practice version of SET I sometimes play where you draw two random cards and have to name the third card that would make a valid set.<p>In Tidy Baby you are presented with two \u201cgame cards\u201d and a grid of up to nine candidates to complete a valid set \u2013 your job is to pick the right one before the clock runs out.<p>Unlike in SET, you get points for \u201cpartial\u201d sets where your set is valid on one or two dimensions (but not all three). It\u2019s actually a pretty fun challenge to try to get only sets that are invalid along all three dimensions.<p>In building the game, we were sort of surprised that the biggest challenge was ensuring that all words were unambiguously one part of speech. You\u2019d be surprised how hard it is to find three-letter adjectives that are not also common verbs or nouns. We did our best!<p>We\u2019ve got three \u201cpaces\u201d in the game: Steady, Strenuous, and Grueling (s/o MECC!)<p>Let us know what you think!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46434580</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
