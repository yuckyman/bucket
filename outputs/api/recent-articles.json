      "title": "Spontaneous neural activity changes in minimal hepatic encephalopathy before and 1 month after liver transplantation",
      "content": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the initial stage of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), MHE patients have associated with widespread neuro-psychological impairment. Liver transplantation (LT) can restore metabolic abnormalities but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to longitudinally evaluate brain function alteration in MHE patients one month after LT and their correlation with cognitive changes by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI data was collected from 32 healthy controls and 27 MHE before and 1 month after LT. Between-group comparisons of demographic data and neuropsychological scores were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Functional imaging data were analyzed using RESTplus and SPM12 software based on MATLAB 2017b. Gender, age, and years of education were used as covariates to obtain low-frequency fluctuationd (ALFF) and dynamic low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) dindices. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationship between the change of ALFF and dALFF with the change of clinical indexes pre- and post-LT. Compared to controls, ALFF values increased in the Left Cerebelum 8, right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (ORBinf), right superior occipital gyrus (SOG) and decreased in right PreCG and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in patients post-LT; dALFF values increased in the right temporal pole and middle temporal gyrus (TPOmid), right ORBinf, left caudate nucleus (CAU), right SOG and decreased in left PreCG, left PCUN, left ANG, left SMA and left MFG in patients post-LT. Compared to pre-LT, ALFF values of post-LT patients increased in the right calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex (CAL), right MOG and decreased in right cerebelum 8, left PCUN; dALFF values of post-LT patients decreased in right thalamus (THA), left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left MFG. The changes of ALFF in the left PCUN, right CAL and right MOG were correlated with change of digit symbol test (DST) scores (P < 0.05). In summary, this study not only showcases the potential of ALFF/dALFF algorithms for assessing alterations in spontaneous neural activity in MHE, but also provides new insights into the altered brain functions in MHE patients 1 month after LT, which may facilitate the elucidation of elucidation of mechanisms underlying cognitive restoration post-LT in MHE patients.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe nervous system governs fundamental life activities and higher neural functions, maintaining the body\u2019s interaction with the external environment and internal homeostasis. Neurological diseases are a common and complex group of disorders that severely impair patients\u2019 quality of life and physical health. Flavonoids, as a class of active components widely present in natural plants, play a crucial role in the research on neurological diseases.ObjectiveThe purpose of this review is to systematically sum up the action mechanisms, research advancements, and existing clinical uses of flavonoids in preventing and treating neurological diseases, probing into their potential in the management of neurological diseases.MethodsBy searching databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Wiley, Springer, NPG, ACS, Elsevier, and RSC, literature published between 2000 and 2025 concerning the treatment of neurological diseases with flavonoids was collected from both domestic and international sources. Priority should be given to flavonoids that have been confirmed by existing studies to be directly related to the pathogenesis or intervention effect of neurological diseases, with high quality and no contradictory results, clear chemical structures and definite metabolic pathways in vivo. Flavonoids that have no clear neurological association, have only been reported once and lack repeated verification or have a low level of evidence, and whose structures have not been resolved or whose metabolic processes are ambiguous should be excluded. After excluding studies with duplicate components and mechanisms, as well as outdated ones, a total of 190 core studies were finally screened and included from more than 15,000 literatures. These were systematically organized, categorized, and analysed across five dimensions: types of flavonoids, disease categories, experimental models, regulatory effects, and key targets.ResultsFlavonoids can exert neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases through multiple pathways, such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and neurotransmitter regulation.ConclusionFlavonoids exhibit clear pharmacological effects and favorable safety profiles in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases, laying a foundation for the research and development of new drugs.",

      "content": "The proliferation of deepfake technologies presents serious challenges for forensic speech authentication. We propose a deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve detection of manipulated audio. Leveraging the spectral feature extraction of CNNs and the temporal modeling of LSTMs, the model demonstrates superior accuracy and generalization across the ASVspoof2019 LA and WaveFake datasets. Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCCs) were employed as acoustic features and outperformed MFCC and GFCC representations. To enhance transparency and trustworthiness, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including Grad-CAM and SHAP, were applied, revealing that the model focuses on high-frequency artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These interpretable analyses validate both the models design and the forensic relevance of LFCC features. The proposed approach thus provides a robust, interpretable, and XAI-driven solution for forensic authentic detection.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
