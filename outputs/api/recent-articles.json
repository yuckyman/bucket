      "title": "Dynamic electrocortical states and paradoxical complexity during desflurane anesthesia",
      "content": "Background: How general anesthesia alters the dynamics of electrocortical activity is crucial to understand the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness. Local cortical activity undergoes spontaneous transitions at constant anesthetic concentration. The spatial organization and temporal dynamics of state transitions in large-scale electrocortical activity is incompletely understood. Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! Ilya and Nikita here. We're building wispbit (<a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>) - a tool that helps keep codebase standards alive.<p>With the help of AI coding tools, engineers are writing more code than ever. Code output has increased, but the tooling to manage this hasn't improved. Background agents still write bad code, and your IDE still writes slop without the right context.<p>So we built wispbit. It works by scanning your codebase for patterns you already use, and coming up with rules. Rules are kept up to date as standards change, and you can edit rules any time.<p>You can enforce these rules during code review, and because we have this rules system, you can run a CLI locally to review using these rules. You can think of it as a portable rules file that you can bring anywhere.<p>We put a lot of work into making a system that produces good rules and avoids slop. For repository crawling, we have an agent that dispatches subagents, similar to Anthropic's research agent. These subagents will go through and look for common patterns within modules and directories, and report back to the main agent, which synthesizes the results. We also do a historical scan on your pull request comments, determine which ones were addressed, filter out comments that wouldn't make a good rule, and use that to create or update rules.<p>Our early users are seeing 80%+ resolution rates, meaning that 80% of comments that wispbit makes are resolved.<p>Long-term, we see ourselves being a validation layer for AI-written code. With tools like Devin and Cursor, we find ourselves having to re-prompt the same solution many times. We still don't know the long-term implications on AI-assisted codebases, so we want to get in front of that as soon as possible.<p>We've opened up signups for free to HN folks at <a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>. We're also around to chat and answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584017\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584017</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Common workplace challenges such as feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or disengaged often remain hidden due to fear of judgment or social norms, contributing to rising mental health crises and organizational dysfunction. This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record neural activity from 67 executives in the field as they watched a video about...",

      "content": "Coordination serves as a fundamental driving force in the evolution of human society, and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its ability to modulate human coordination. However, the neural mechanisms underlying coordination and whether tES positively influences it remain under investigation. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of interbrain synchronization (IBS) and the neural efficiency enhancement of the mirror neuron system (MNS) using single...",
