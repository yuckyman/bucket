      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Peeps,</p> <p>I'm excited to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg\">Kreuzberg</a> v4.0.0 is coming very soon. We will release v4.0.0 at the beginning of next year - in just a couple of weeks time. For now, v4.0.0-rc.8 has been released to all channels.</p> <h2>What is Kreuzberg?</h2> <p>Kreuzberg is a document intelligence toolkit for extracting text, metadata, tables, images, and structured data from 56+ file formats. It was originally written in Python (v1-v3), where it demonstrated strong performance characteristics compared to alternatives in the ecosystem.</p> <h2>What's new in V4?</h2> <h3>A Complete Rust Rewrite with Polyglot Bindings</h3> <p>The new version of Kreuzberg represents a massive architectural evolution. <strong>Kreuzberg has been completely rewritten in Rust</strong> - leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and native performance. The new architecture consists of a high-performance Rust core with native bindings to multiple languages. That's right - it's no longer just a Python library.</p> <p><strong>Kreuzberg v4 is now available for 7 languages across 8 runtime bindings:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Rust</strong> (native library)</li> <li><strong>Python</strong> (PyO3 native bindings)</li> <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - Node.js (NAPI-RS native bindings) + Deno/Browser/Edge (WASM)</li> <li><strong>Ruby</strong> (Magnus FFI)</li> <li><strong>Java 25+</strong> (Panama Foreign Function &amp; Memory API)</li> <li><strong>C#</strong> (P/Invoke)</li> <li><strong>Go</strong> (cgo bindings)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Post v4.0.0 roadmap includes:</strong></p> <ul> <li>PHP</li> <li>Elixir (via Rustler - with Erlang and Gleam interop)</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, it's available as a <strong>CLI</strong> (installable via <code>cargo</code> or <code>homebrew</code>), <strong>HTTP REST API server</strong>, <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP) server</strong> for Claude Desktop/Continue.dev, and as <strong>public Docker images</strong>.</p> <h3>Why the Rust Rewrite? Performance and Architecture</h3> <p>The Rust rewrite wasn't just about performance - though that's a major benefit. It was an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the architecture:</p> <p><strong>Architectural improvements:</strong> - <strong>Zero-copy operations</strong> via Rust's ownership model - <strong>True async concurrency</strong> with Tokio runtime (no GIL limitations) - <strong>Streaming parsers</strong> for constant memory usage on multi-GB files - <strong>SIMD-accelerated text processing</strong> for token reduction and string operations - <strong>Memory-safe FFI boundaries</strong> for all language bindings - <strong>Plugin system</strong> with trait-based extensibility</p> <h3>v3 vs v4: What Changed?</h3> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>v3 (Python)</th> <th>v4 (Rust Core)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Core Language</strong></td> <td>Pure Python</td> <td>Rust 2024 edition</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>File Formats</strong></td> <td>30-40+ (via Pandoc)</td> <td><strong>56+ (native parsers)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Support</strong></td> <td>Python only</td> <td><strong>7 languages</strong> (Rust/Python/TS/Ruby/Java/Go/C#)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dependencies</strong></td> <td>Requires Pandoc (system binary)</td> <td><strong>Zero system dependencies</strong> (all native)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Embeddings</strong></td> <td>Not supported</td> <td>\u2713 FastEmbed with ONNX (3 presets + custom)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Semantic Chunking</strong></td> <td>Via semantic-text-splitter library</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (text + markdown-aware)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Token Reduction</strong></td> <td>Built-in (TF-IDF based)</td> <td>\u2713 Enhanced with 3 modes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Detection</strong></td> <td>Optional (fast-langdetect)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (68 languages)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong></td> <td>Optional (KeyBERT)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (YAKE + RAKE algorithms)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>OCR Backends</strong></td> <td>Tesseract/EasyOCR/PaddleOCR</td> <td><strong>Same + better integration</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Plugin System</strong></td> <td>Limited extractor registry</td> <td><strong>Full trait-based</strong> (4 plugin types)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Page Tracking</strong></td> <td>Character-based indices</td> <td><strong>Byte-based with O(1) lookup</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Servers</strong></td> <td>REST API (Litestar)</td> <td><strong>HTTP (Axum) + MCP + MCP-SSE</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Installation Size</strong></td> <td>~100MB base</td> <td><strong>16-31 MB complete</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Memory Model</strong></td> <td>Python heap management</td> <td><strong>RAII with streaming</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Concurrency</strong></td> <td>asyncio (GIL-limited)</td> <td><strong>Tokio work-stealing</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h3>Replacement of Pandoc - Native Performance</h3> <p>Kreuzberg v3 relied on <strong>Pandoc</strong> - an amazing tool, but one that had to be invoked via subprocess because of its GPL license. This had significant impacts:</p> <p><strong>v3 Pandoc limitations:</strong> - System dependency (installation required) - Subprocess overhead on every document - No streaming support - Limited metadata extraction - ~500MB+ installation footprint</p> <p><strong>v4 native parsers:</strong> - <strong>Zero external dependencies</strong> - everything is native Rust - Direct parsing with full control over extraction - <strong>Substantially more metadata</strong> extracted (e.g., DOCX document properties, section structure, style information) - <strong>Streaming support</strong> for massive files (tested on multi-GB XML documents with stable memory) - Example: PPTX extractor is now a <strong>fully streaming parser</strong> capable of handling gigabyte-scale presentations with constant memory usage and high throughput</p> <h3>New File Format Support</h3> <p>v4 expanded format support from ~20 to <strong>56+ file formats</strong>, including:</p> <p><strong>Added legacy format support:</strong> - <code>.doc</code> (Word 97-2003) - <code>.ppt</code> (PowerPoint 97-2003) - <code>.xls</code> (Excel 97-2003) - <code>.eml</code> (Email messages) - <code>.msg</code> (Outlook messages)</p> <p><strong>Added academic/technical formats:</strong> - LaTeX (<code>.tex</code>) - BibTeX (<code>.bib</code>) - Typst (<code>.typ</code>) - JATS XML (scientific articles) - DocBook XML - FictionBook (<code>.fb2</code>) - OPML (<code>.opml</code>)</p> <p><strong>Better Office support:</strong> - XLSB, XLSM (Excel binary/macro formats) - Better structured metadata extraction from DOCX/PPTX/XLSX - Full table extraction from presentations - Image extraction with deduplication</p> <h3>New Features: Full Document Intelligence Solution</h3> <p>The v4 rewrite was also an opportunity to close gaps with commercial alternatives and add features specifically designed for <strong>RAG applications and LLM workflows</strong>:</p> <h4>1. <strong>Embeddings (NEW)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>FastEmbed integration</strong> with full ONNX Runtime acceleration</li> <li>Three presets: <code>&quot;fast&quot;</code> (384d), <code>&quot;balanced&quot;</code> (512d), <code>&quot;quality&quot;</code> (768d/1024d)</li> <li>Custom model support (bring your own ONNX model)</li> <li>Local generation (no API calls, no rate limits)</li> <li>Automatic model downloading and caching</li> <li>Per-chunk embedding generation</li> </ul> <p>```python from kreuzberg import ExtractionConfig, EmbeddingConfig, EmbeddingModelType</p> <p>config = ExtractionConfig( embeddings=EmbeddingConfig( model=EmbeddingModelType.preset(&quot;balanced&quot;), normalize=True ) ) result = kreuzberg.extract_bytes(pdf_bytes, config=config)</p> <h1>result.embeddings contains vectors for each chunk</h1> <p>```</p> <h4>2. <strong>Semantic Text Chunking (NOW BUILT-IN)</strong></h4> <p>Now integrated directly into the core (v3 used external semantic-text-splitter library): - <strong>Structure-aware chunking</strong> that respects document semantics - Two strategies: - Generic text chunker (whitespace/punctuation-aware) - Markdown chunker (preserves headings, lists, code blocks, tables) - Configurable chunk size and overlap - Unicode-safe (handles CJK, emojis correctly) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping - Per-chunk metadata with byte offsets</p> <h4>3. <strong>Byte-Accurate Page Tracking (BREAKING CHANGE)</strong></h4> <p>This is a critical improvement for LLM applications:</p> <ul> <li><strong>v3</strong>: Character-based indices (<code>char_start</code>/<code>char_end</code>) - incorrect for UTF-8 multi-byte characters</li> <li><strong>v4</strong>: Byte-based indices (<code>byte_start</code>/<code>byte_end</code>) - correct for all string operations</li> </ul> <p>Additional page features: - O(1) lookup: &quot;which page is byte offset X on?&quot; \u2192 instant answer - Per-page content extraction - Page markers in combined text (e.g., <code>--- Page 5 ---</code>) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping for citations</p> <h4>4. <strong>Enhanced Token Reduction for LLM Context</strong></h4> <p>Enhanced from v3 with three configurable modes to save on LLM costs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Light mode</strong>: ~15% reduction (preserve most detail)</li> <li><strong>Moderate mode</strong>: ~30% reduction (balanced)</li> <li><strong>Aggressive mode</strong>: ~50% reduction (key information only)</li> </ul> <p>Uses TF-IDF sentence scoring with position-aware weighting and language-specific stopword filtering.

      "title": "\u03b42-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.",

      "title": "Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons",
      "content": "The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.",

      "title": "Satellite microglia gate neuronal excitability by shielding inhibitory synapses in adult brain",
      "content": "Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.",

      "title": "A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons",
      "content": "Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel \"snapshot\" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.",
