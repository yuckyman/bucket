      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "Objective. Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work aims to develop and personalize whole-brain computational models in epilepsy using multimodal clinical data to simulate and evaluate individualized therapeutic strategies. Approach. We present a computational framework that constructs patient-specific whole-brain models of seizure propagation by integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. Main results. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, including variable sensitivity to different pharmacological agents and identification of critical regions whose removal or modulation reduced seizure spread. Significance. This framework provides a mechanistic, interpretable approach to simulate and compare individualized treatment strategies. By integrating multimodal data into a unified whole-brain model, it has the potential to improve clinical decision-making in epilepsy by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.",

      "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

      "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
      "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

      "content": "The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a community-driven standard for the organization of data and metadata from a growing range of neuroscience modalities. This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",
