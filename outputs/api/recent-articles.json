      "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
      "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

      "title": "Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)",
      "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.",

      "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

      "title": "Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions",
      "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

      "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

      "title": "Molecular dynamics of the pathogenic KCNQ2 variant G256W reveal mechanisms of channel dysfunction in epileptic encephalopathy",
      "content": "Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.",

      "title": "Torsional Force by Helical Pericytes Regulates Blood Flow in Downstream Capillaries",
      "content": "This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.",

      "title": "Early Diabetic Ca2+ Handling Impairments in the Rod Bipolar Pathway",
      "content": "Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses. The underlying mechanism for this alteration is complex and not yet clearly elucidated.",

      "content": "Intention lies at the core of human behavior, allowing flexible and goal-directed interaction with the environment. However, how it emerges in infancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that intentional action can emerge before overt reaching, revealing that 3-month-old infants display pupil dilation preceding self-initiated actions during interaction with a suspended mobile toy. This phasic pupil dilation first appeared after movement onset but gradually shifted to precede it through environmental interaction, reflecting the emergence of action preparation and prediction of action outcomes. This shift also implies that infants are capable of anticipating the timing of their forthcoming movements. Furthermore, the antecedent pupil dilation occurred only with efficient movements characterised by reduced muscle co-contractions. These findings suggest that infants learn to predict outcomes of their own actions and initiate particular movements at self-determined timings, marking the emergence of intentional action.",

      "content": "N-Linked glycosylation of tau is implicated in Alzheimers disease, yet how it influences tau propagation and neuronal uptake remains unclear. Here, we use chemically defined N-glycoforms of 2N4R tau and the K18 repeat domain to map how glycan site and structure reprogram tau-polyanion binding, seeding, and entry into human neurons. Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications. Cross-seeding experiments show that N-glycosylation selectively tunes nucleation compatibility between tau proteoforms; GlcNAc at Asn410 in full-length tau and small glycans at Asn359 in K18 most strongly accelerate aggregation. In HEK293T FRET biosensor cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons, N-glycans enhance or suppress seeding and pHrodo-reported uptake in a site- and glycan-dependent manner, with Asn410 glycosylation markedly potentiating cellular seeding. Pharmacological inhibition with atropine, dynasore, and cytochalasin D further indicates that N-glycans rebalance muscarinic, dynamin-dependent, and actin-dependent uptake routes. Together, these data establish N-linked glycosylation as a tunable regulator of tau trafficking and prion-like spread, coupling extracellular receptor usage to intracellular cofactor engagement, and reveals druggable nodes in uptake.",

As an emerging paradigm of brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), speech BCI has the potential to directly reflect auditory perception and thoughts, offering a promising communication alternative for patients with aphasia. Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. Approach. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Main results. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study on multi-modality assisted decoding for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs.",

      "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
      "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

      "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

      "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",

      "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
      "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

      "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
      "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",
