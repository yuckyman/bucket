      "content": "A 36-year-old man with known history of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) of 13-year duration who was undergoing continuous treatment with subcutaneous interferon-\u03b2 (INF-\u03b2) (44 \u00b5g three times per week) presented to the emergency department of our hospital with blurry vision of 1-week duration. Routine MRI performed 1 month earlier had revealed five new fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-hyperintense cerebellar lesions without contrast enhancement, suggesting active RMS, albeit...",

While foundation models (FMs) show promise in medical imaging, their optimal selection and fine-tuning strategies for classifying carotid atherosclerosis from retinal images remain unclear. Using data from 39,620 individuals, we evaluated four vision FMs with three fine-tuning methods. Performance was evaluated by predictive performance, clinical utility by survival analysis for future CVD...",

Herbal medicines should be used only as an adjunct to conventional treatment, with shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. Careful monitoring for hypoglycaemia is essential, particularly when herbal medicines are used concurrently with...",
