      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.15618v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The shift away from multigenerational families to nuclear families in India has created a growing need to support older adults living independently. While technology can help address this gap, older adults' limited exposure to newer technology restricts the adoption of such solutions. However, they remain comfortable with long-standing technologies like television (TV). This study explores their daily technology usage and challenges, aiming to determine whether TV can be leveraged to improve their quality of life. We examined how TV systems could be enhanced to assist older adults with tasks such as staying connected, receiving health alerts, and ensuring security. Using a participatory design approach, we developed video probes using the prototype of the TV-based application and interviewed 27 older adults to assess its acceptance and usability. Our findings demonstrate older adults' strong interest in a TV-based solution and a preference for familiar technology to support security, independence, and wellbeing.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.15575v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-driven chatbots are increasingly used to support community health workers (CHWs) in developing regions, yet little is known about how cultural framings in chatbot design shape trust in collectivist contexts where decisions are rarely made in isolation. This paper examines how CHWs in rural India responded to chatbots that delivered identical health content but varied in one specific cultural lever -- social norms. Through a mixed-methods study with 61 ASHAs who compared four normative framings -- neutral, descriptive, narrative identity, and injunctive authority -- we (1) analyze how framings influence preferences and trust, and (2) compare effects across low- and high-ambiguity scenarios. Results show that narrative framings were most preferred but encouraged uncritical overreliance, while authority framings were least preferred yet supported calibrated trust. We conclude with design recommendations for dynamic framing strategies that adapt to context and argue for calibrated trust -- following correct advice and resisting incorrect advice -- as a critical evaluation metric for safe, culturally-grounded AI.",

With precisely generated visual stimulus frequency, it is possible to translate brain signals into external actions or signals. Traditionally, SSVEP data is collected from the occipital region using electrodes with or without gel, normally mounted on a head cap. In this experimental study, we develop an in ear electrode to collect SSVEP data for four different flicker frequencies and compare against occipital scalp electrode data. Data from five participants demonstrates the feasibility of in-ear electrode based SSVEP, significantly enhancing the practicability of wearable BCI applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.15440v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI co-writing systems challenge long held ideals about agency and ownership in the creative process, thereby hindering widespread adoption. In order to address this, we investigate conceptions of agency and ownership in AI creative co-writing. Drawing on insights from a review of commercial systems, we developed three co-writing systems with identical functionality but distinct interface metaphors: agentic, tool-like, and magical. Through interviews with professional and non-professional writers (n = 18), we explored how these metaphors influenced participants' sense of control and authorship. Our analysis resulted in a taxonomy of agency and ownership subtypes and underscore how tool-like metaphors shift writers' expected points of control while agentic metaphors foreground conceptual contributions. We argue that interface metaphors not only guide expectations of control but also frame conceptions of authorship. We conclude with recommendations for the design of AI co-writing systems, emphasizing how metaphor shapes user experience and creative practice.",

These systems, which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS), have the potential to reshape our information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to top-down fact-checking. To deeply understand the features and implications of such systems, we perform a systematic literature review of existing CCS research and analyze several real-world CSS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with three distinct components. First, we present a theoretical model to help conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six key aspects of CCS: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. Third, we identify key normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our framework integrates these theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.",

In this work, we re-imagine Behavioral Sleep Medicine (BSM) by designing a voice-based conversational sleep diary and specialist-facing visualization tool. Through this design process, we probed specialists' vision of how conversational agents (CAs) could extend beyond diary intake to enhance behavioral sleep medicine. Our multi-stage approach included: (1) interviews with specialists to identify shortcomings in current use of text-based diaries, (2) iterative co-design of a conversational diary and visualization tool, and (3) focus groups to explore the broader potential of CAs in BSM. This work contributes design insights into how CAs can support behavioral interventions, highlights opportunities and challenges for integration into practice, and expands the design space of CAs for behavioral health.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.15372v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The sense of realism in avatar animation is a widely pursued goal in social VR applications. A common approach to enhancing realism is improving the match between avatar motion and real-world human movement. However, experience with existing VR platforms may reshape users' expectations, suggesting that matching reality is not the only path to enhancing the sense of realism. This study examines how different levels of experience with a social VR platform influence users' criteria for evaluating the realism of avatar animation. Participants were shown a set of animations varying in the degree they reflected real-world motion and motion seen on the social VR platform VRChat. Results showed that users with no VRChat experience found animations recorded on VRChat unnatural and unrealistic, but experienced users in fact rated these animations as more likely to come from a real person than the motion-capture animations. Additionally, highly experienced users recognized the intent to imitate VRChat's style and noted the differences from genuine in-platform animations. All these results suggest users' expectations of and criteria for realistic animation were shaped by their experience level. The findings support the idea that realism in avatar animation does not solely depend on mimicking real-world movement. Experience with VR platforms can shape how users expect, perceive, and evaluate animation realism. This insight can inform the design of more immersive VR environments and virtual humans in the future.",

      "title": "Collective Voice: Recovered-Peer Support Mediated by An LLM-Based Chatbot for Eating Disorder Recovery",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.15289v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Peer recovery narratives provide unique benefits beyond professional or lay mentoring by fostering hope and sustained recovery in eating disorder (ED) contexts. Yet, such support is limited by the scarcity of peer-involved programs and potential drawbacks on recovered peers, including relapse risk. To address this, we designed RecoveryTeller, a chatbot adopting a recovered-peer persona that portrays itself as someone recovered from an ED. We examined whether such a persona can reproduce the support affordances of peer recovery narratives. We compared RecoveryTeller with a lay-mentor persona chatbot offering similar guidance but without a recovery background. We conducted a 20-day cross-over deployment study with 26 ED participants, each using both chatbots for 10 days. RecoveryTeller elicited stronger emotional resonance than a lay-mentor chatbot, yet tensions between emotional and epistemic trust led participants to view the two personas as complementary rather than substitutes. We provide design implications for mental health chatbot persona design.",

      "title": "Subject Matter Expertise vs Professional Management in Collective Sequential Decision Making",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.15263v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Your company's CEO is retiring. You search for a successor. You can promote an employee from the company familiar with the company's operations, or recruit an external professional manager. Who should you prefer? It has not been clear how to address this question, the \"subject matter expertise vs. professional manager debate\", quantitatively and objectively. We note that a company's success depends on long sequences of interdependent decisions, with often-opposing recommendations of diverse board members. To model this task in a controlled environment, we utilize chess - a complex, sequential game with interdependent decisions which allows for quantitative analysis of performance and expertise (since the states, actions and game outcomes are well-defined). The availability of chess engines differing in style and expertise, allows scalable experimentation. We considered a team of (computer) chess players. At each turn, team members recommend a move and a manager chooses a recommendation. We compared the performance of two manager types. For manager as \"subject matter expert\", we used another (computer) chess player that assesses the recommendations of the team members based on its own chess expertise. We examined the performance of such managers at different strength levels. To model a \"professional manager\", we used Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a network that identifies the board positions in which different team members have relative advantage, without any pretraining in chess. We further examined this network to see if any chess knowledge is acquired implicitly. We found that subject matter expertise beyond a minimal threshold does not significantly contribute to team synergy. Moreover, performance of a RL-trained \"professional\" manager significantly exceeds that of even the best \"expert\" managers, while acquiring only limited understanding of chess.",

      "title": "Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.15748v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.\n  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.\n  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.",

      "title": "Modeling Adaptive Tracking of Predictable Stimuli in Electric Fish",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.15344v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The weakly electric fish \\emph{Eigenmannia virescens} naturally swims back and forth to stay within a moving refuge, tracking its motion using visual and electrosensory feedback. Previous experiments show that when the refuge oscillates as a low-frequency sinusoid (below about 0.5 Hz), the tracking is nearly perfect, but phase lag increases and gain decreases at higher frequencies. Here, we model this nonlinear behavior as an adaptive internal model principle (IMP) system. Specifically, an adaptive state estimator identifies the \\emph{a priori} unknown frequency, and feeds this parameter estimate into a closed-loop IMP-based system built around a lightly damped harmonic oscillator. We prove that the closed-loop tracking error of the IMP-based system, where the online adaptive frequency estimate is used as a surrogate for the unknown frequency, converges exponentially to that of an ideal control system with perfect information about the stimulus. Simulations further show that our model reproduces the fish refuge tracking Bode plot across a wide frequency range. These results establish the theoretical validity of combining the IMP with an adaptive identification process and provide a basic framework in adaptive sensorimotor control.",

      "title": "Kuramoto Orientation Diffusion Models",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.15328v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \\textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.",

      "title": "A Hypothesis-First Framework for Mechanistic Model Evaluation and Selection in Neuroimaging",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.16070v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neuroimaging provides rich measurements of brain structure and neural activity, but turning these data into mechanistic insight remains difficult. Statistical models quantify associations without much considerations for how they arise, whereas bio-realistic models directly embody candidate mechanisms but remain hard to deploy rigorously without specialized training. We present a framework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and supplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications, such as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based on predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected model behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a model solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an optimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model is constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire parameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived from the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using standard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson Cowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses, penalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications. This provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models for neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology.",
