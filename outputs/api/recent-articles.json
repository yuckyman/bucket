      "title": "The ventral visual stream for reading converges on the transmodal language network",
      "content": "Reading bridges sensation and cognition. To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this region's role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this \"orthographic stream\" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing. This basal language network region may represent an interface between visual and transmodal language systems, thus serving as a critical nexus for reading.",

      "title": "Hemispheric laterality of the putamen predicts pseudoneglect",
      "content": "Healthy individuals tend to exhibit a subtle leftward attentional bias, a phenomenon termed pseudoneglect. While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain. Our findings pave the way for early diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with subcortical atrophies including Parkinson's Disease and dementia.",

      "content": "Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is a defining feature of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet how this leads to selective neuronal vulnerability is poorly understood. Here, using human iPSC-derived neurons and a large multi-omics dataset of ALS/FTD patients, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology induces the inclusion of an in-frame cryptic exon in human G3BP1. The resulting CRYPTIC G3BP1 protein contains an additional 10 amino acids within the highly conserved NTF2L domain, which acts as a dominant negative and disrupts stress granule dynamics. We further show that cryptic exon inclusion in G3BP1 upon TDP-43 loss is enriched in neurons. Mechanistically, the loss of TDP-43 unmasks a binding site for the neuron-specific splicing regulator SRRM4 within intron 2 of G3BP1, enabling the inclusion of the cryptic exon. Collectively, our findings reveal that neuron-specific regulatory mechanisms intersect with TDP-43 -mediated splicing and suggest a mechanistic basis for the increased neuronal vulnerability observed in ALS/FTD.",
