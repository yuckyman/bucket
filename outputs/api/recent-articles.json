      "title": "Unveiling early visual cortical mechanisms in perceptual filling-in: a parametric study of eccentricity and movement dependence",
      "content": "Surface perception relies on interactions between boundary encoding and surface filling-in. In a perceptual filling-in paradigm, a blank figure becomes perceptually replaced by a textured background after prolonged fixation of a point away from the figure. Filling-in begins when neurons representing the figure's boundary adapt, allowing background-related activity to spread into the figure's retinotopic representation. Adaptation proceeds faster the better the boundary is stabilized in a neuron's receptive field (RF). We hypothesized that moving the figure boundary beyond a neuron's RF would reduce adaptation and hinder filling-in, with larger movements permitting progressively less filling-in. As RF size increases with eccentricity, we further hypothesized that greater eccentricities would require larger movements to interfere with filling-in. Our results confirmed both predictions. The reduction in filling-in duration with increasing motion range permitted estimating RF size at each eccentricity. The slope of a linear function relating RF size to eccentricity matched values reported in human fMRI studies of V1/V2, suggesting that boundary adaptation involves early visual areas. We also explored whether microsaccade amplitude affects filling-in, but found no supporting evidence. Thus, external figure motion and microsaccades may disrupt adaptation through different mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into neural adaptation processes preceding perceptual filling-in.",

      "title": "What is happening in Dorsal Root Ganglia? A computational analysis of cross-excitation phenomenon",
      "content": "The phenomenon of cross-excitation - interaction between neurons of a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in intact organism, presents a great challenge since its discovery. It can not be addressed to classical neuron-neuron interactions, as the mentioned neurons are believed to be physiologically isolated by glial sheaths from one another. In this work we test existing hypotheses which explain the phenomenon from both biophysical and statistical perspectives. Our conclusion is that neither each proposed mechanism alone, nor interactions of them can adequately describe cross-excitation in normal conditions. We wish to draw greater attention towards the phenomenon, as it seems to be an important part of normal sensory information processing.",

      "title": "Sex-dependent hypothalamic microinflammation and microglial polarization: The role of JNK in high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance",
      "content": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, are major global health challenges. Early hypothalamic microinflammation is emerging as a key contributor to the onset of metabolic dysfunction, but its temporal dynamics, underlying mechanisms, and sex-specific differences remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of short-term high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on hypothalamic microinflammation, glial activation, and insulin signaling in male and female mice. Males rapidly developed hypothalamic microinflammation, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and impaired insulin signaling, whereas females did not show these alterations. Interestingly, we also observed a sex-specific pattern in microglial M2 polarization: females maintained a sustained M2 response throughout the experimental period, while males exhibited only a transient peak that declined in the following days. These sex-specific differences in microglial dynamics and polarization may be linked to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, a classical mediator of inflammatory signaling. To further explore this, we analyzed mice lacking JNK3, the CNS-enriched isoform of JNK. Loss of JNK3 disrupted early microglial polarization, abolished the transient M2 response, and predisposed males to enhanced gliosis and partial hypothalamic insulin resistance, while females retained partial resilience. These findings indicate that JNK3 contributes to the regulation of microglial dynamics and polarization in response to metabolic stress. Overall, our study highlights a sex-dependent role of microglia and JNK in shaping early hypothalamic microinflammation and central insulin sensitivity, providing potential targets for intervention in obesity-associated metabolic disease.",

      "title": "Autonomic Indicators of Self-Transcendence: Insights from the Numadelic VR Paradigm",
      "content": "Self-transcendent experiences (STEs) offer profound and beneficial shifts in perspective, yet remain largely inaccessible outside elite contemplative or pharmacological contexts. Neural measures have deepened our understanding of these states, but their cost and limited ecological validity constrain broader application. This study evaluates heart rate variability (HRV) amplitude, a measure reflecting dynamic sympathovagal balance, as a cost-effective and sustainable physiological marker of STE during numadelic virtual reality (VR) experiences, multi-person, immersive journeys that can induce STE through dissolving self-boundaries and fostering embodied presence. Building on previous work linking non-ordinary states of consciousness with autonomic nervous system activity during psychedelic drug administration, we tested the hypothesis that HRV amplitude may reflect STE depth and predict affective and prosocial outcomes during non-drug numadelic VR experiences. Specifically, ninety-six participants engaged in guided meditation within either a numadelic VR setting or a non-VR audio-guided group format. Physiological data (cardiac activity and respiration) were recorded during the meditation, alongside psychological assessments pre- and post-session. Findings confirm that HRV amplitude measured during numadelic VR correlates with subjective STE ratings, compassion traits, and emotional improvement following VR practice. Additional analysis of data from a prior psychedelic drug study further validated the relevance of this measure across consciousness expanding modalities. These results advance the psychophysiological mapping of STEs and highlight HRV amplitude as a potential real-time biomarker which may help to guide participants toward self-transcendent states within adaptive environments. By integrating contemplative science with immersive design, this work supports the development of scalable tools that enhance both access to and understanding of STEs.",

      "content": "Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal morphology and axonal transport. While phosphorylation is known to regulate Tau-microtubule interactions, the contribution of specific phosphorylation patterns in situ remains poorly understood due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. In this study, we combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with dephosphorylation-mimetic mutations and computational modeling to analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Tau-microtubule interaction. We particularly focused on the proline-rich region, of which phosphorylation has been studied in physiological and pathological perspectives, and generated a dephosphorylation-mimetic Tau mutant by substituting key phosphorylation sites with alanine residues and compared its microtubule-binding dynamics to those of WT-Tau in FRAP experiments. Experimental data, together with simulation-based parameter exploration, revealed that the overall number of phosphorylated sites plays a more dominant role than their specific locations in modulating Tau-microtubule affinity. These findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Tau and establish a computational-experimental framework for interrogating intracellular protein dynamics.",

      "title": "Excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway triggers adult-onset motor axonal degeneration",
      "content": "Axonal and synaptic degeneration are key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we performed an unbiased forward genetic mosaic screen to identify genes required for maintenance of adult motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the Drosophila leg. We identified 49 mutations in 30 genes, including mutations in 8 genes resulting in adult-onset progressive degeneration. We found that loss of pebbled (peb) function results in adult-onset motor axonal and NMJ degeneration, and age-dependent motor deficits. Peb is the Drosophila RREB1 ortholog, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that negatively regulates transcription of RAS/MAPK pathway target genes. Loss of peb function resulted in excessive RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and loss of function of other negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway also induced adult-onset progressive NMJ degeneration and motor deficits. Importantly, treatment of adult flies with the MEK1/2 inhibitor mirdametinib induced a dosage-dependent rescue of peb mutant motor neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, RAS/MAPK pathway overactivation results in adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration, which can be prevented by RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition.",

      "content": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. However, tools to image glutamate dynamics in the whole brain with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. Therefore, we developed GluTrooper, a novel mouse line engineered for inducible and long-lasting expression of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3. GluTrooper mice crossed with Emx1-Cre lines demonstrated uniform and stable sensor expression in excitatory neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. iGluSnFR3 expression remained stable for at least 12 months, enabling longitudinal observations of glutamate dynamics over extended periods. Using multimodal imaging in awake mice, we demonstrated the versatility of GluTrooper across multiple spatial scales: from mesoscale widefield cortical imaging to cellular resolution with two-photon microscopy. Moreover, during cortical spreading depolarization, bilateral whole-brain glutamate dynamics and contralateral cortical disinhibition were detected with high fidelity. Accordingly, the GluTrooper may open new avenues for the better understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.",

      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",
