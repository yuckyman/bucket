      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Topological data analysis reveals rigid brain-state dynamics during self-viewing in trait rumination",
      "content": "Rumination -- repetitive, negatively valenced, self-focused thought -- is a maladaptive cognitive style linked to emotional dysregulation and psychiatric risk. To investigate its neural underpinnings in a naturalistic context, we developed an fMRI paradigm in which participants observed and reflected on videos of their own past group-based problem-solving sessions, a naturalistic self-relevant context rarely examined in fMRI studies. Thirty-two adults were recorded during collaborative design-thinking tasks in triads. In a subsequent scanning session, each participant viewed two self-relevant team videos and one control team video, followed by a structured reflection period. We assessed trait rumination using the Rumination Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) and applied Topological Data Analysis (TDA) via the Mapper algorithm to model individual-level whole-brain dynamics during the task. Mapper shape graphs captured temporal transitions between brain states, allowing us to quantify the similarity of timepoints across the session. Individuals with higher trait rumination showed significantly higher temporal similarity, indicating reduced brain-state variability, during self-relevant conditions (r = 0.46, p = 0.018). This effect was not observed during the control condition. These findings suggest that rumination is associated with rigid brain dynamics during self-observation and evaluative processing. Traditional GLM and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analyses confirmed task engagement of key self-referential and social-evaluative regions, while Mapper revealed dynamic features not captured by static or group-averaged methods. Together, these findings demonstrate that trait rumination is associated with rigid large-scale brain dynamics during self-relevant cognition and highlight the value of combining naturalistic paradigms with topological approaches to capture behaviorally meaningful signatures.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",
