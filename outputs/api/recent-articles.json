      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I've been working on a side project called <strong>Maan</strong> (which means &quot;together&quot; in Arabic - \u0645\u0639\u0627\u064b). It's a live coding space where multiple users can collaborate on code, similar to how VS Code Live Share operates, but I built it from scratch using Python.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> Maan lets you code together in real-time with other developers. You can edit files simultaneously, see each other's cursors, chat while you work, and clone GitHub repos directly into a shared workspace. Think of it like Google Docs but for code editing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Right now, it's more of a proof-of-concept than a production-ready tool. I built it primarily for:</p> <ul> <li>Small teams (2-5 people) who want to pair program remotely</li> <li>Mentors helping students with coding problems</li> <li>Quick code reviews where you can edit together</li> <li>Casual coding sessions with friends</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> Most existing collaborative coding tools either:</p> <ol> <li><strong>VS Code Live Share</strong> - Requires VS Code installation and Microsoft accounts</li> <li><strong>Replit/Glitch</strong> - Great for web projects but limited to their ecosystem</li> <li><strong>CodeTogether</strong> - Enterprise-focused with complex setups</li> </ol> <p>Maan differs by being:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Just a browser tab, no heavy IDE installation</li> <li><strong>Python-native</strong> - Entire backend is Python/Flask based</li> <li><strong>Self-hostable</strong> - Run it on your own server</li> <li><strong>Simpler</strong> - Focuses on core collaboration without tons of features</li> </ul> <p>It originated from a weekend hackathon, so it's not flawless. There are definitely areas that need improvement, some features still need refinement, and the code could use a tidy-up. But the core concept is functional: you can actually code alongside others in real time with minimal setup.</p> <p>Here's what's currently working:</p> <ul> <li>You can see others typing and moving their cursors in real-time.</li> <li>It's powered by Flask with Socket.IO to keep everything synchronized.</li> <li>I've implemented Monaco Editor (the same one used in VS Code).</li> <li>There's a file browser, chat functionality, and the ability to pull in repositories from GitHub.</li> <li>Session hosts have control over who joins and what permissions they have.</li> <li>You can participate as a guest or log in.</li> <li>It seems stable with up to 5 users in a room.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why did I take on this project?</strong> To be honest, I just wanted to experiment and see if I could create a straightforward &quot;live coding together&quot; experience without a complicated setup. Turns out, Python makes it quite manageable! I'm using it for:</p> <ul> <li>Solving coding issues with friends</li> <li>Guiding someone through bug fixes</li> <li>Quick remote collaborations with my team</li> <li>Casual coding sessions</li> </ul> <p>For those interested in the tech side:</p> <ul> <li>Backend: Flask, Socket.IO, SQLAlchemy (keeping it simple with SQLite)</li> <li>Frontend: Monaco Editor with vanilla JavaScript</li> <li>Integrated GitPython for cloning repos, colorful cursors to identify users, and a basic admin panel</li> </ul> <p>Interested in checking it out? \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/elmoiv/maan\">https://github.com/elmoiv/maan</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback\u2014does the real-time experience feel smooth? Is the setup intuitive? What features would make you inclined to use something like this? And if you're curious about how everything fits together, just ask!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elmoiv\"> /u/elmoiv </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqfm1/maan_a_realtime_collaborative_coding_platform/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqfm1/maan_a_realtime_collaborative_coding_platform/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Optimal feedback solutions recapitulate key features of motorcortical population dynamics",
      "content": "Neural populations display complex response patterns with marked transitions between distinct underlying computational strategies on very short timescales during motor tasks. Such complex-yet-structured dynamical strategies may reflect computational needs of neural systems, shaped by optimal feedback and autonomous mechanisms, in addition to biological constraints. Are there overarching computational principles that govern complex dynamical strategies exhibited by the neural population response? Here, we explore the hypothesis that computational strategies underlying neural population response represent optimal feedback solutions to the control of musculoskeletal dynamics through space for a goal. To validate this hypothesis, we develop a procedure called neural optimization using dynamical systems (NODS) learning to modify synaptic strengths within a recurrent network for locally-optimal feedback control of anatomically accurate musculoskeletal models during complex sensorimotor tasks. NODS learning works even when the objective function to be minimized is highly non-linear or the muscle model is very complex. The dynamical strategies underlying the neural network response constructed using NODS learning recapitulate key features of recorded population response. Importantly, optimal feedback solutions using NODS learning suggest that feedback mechanisms are essential for neural populations to flexibly transit between complex-yet-structured strategies. We further show that this framework provides theoretical foundations for why the solutions obtained using deep reinforcement learning algorithms extensively used to model sensorimotor tasks may explain the dynamical strategies underlying recorded population response. In summary, we develop novel methods and approaches suggesting that neural dynamics may be more strongly modulated by optimal feedback mechanisms, in addition to autonomous mechanisms, than previously appreciated.",

      "title": "Distinct Temporal Patterns of Human Neural Firing in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Speech and Orofacial Movement",
      "content": "Clinical studies, along with electrophysiological findings, provide evidence that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) contributes to speech production. These studies have reported that the STN encodes diverse aspects of speech, comprising speech motor planning and execution, timing, and linguistic features such as phonetic content. However, none of these studies have included an orofacial non-speech motor task to evaluate speech-specificity of STN activity. Here, we examined the modulation of STN neurons while participants engaged in two speech tasks (sentence repetition and syllable repetition) as well as two non-speech orofacial movement tasks (jaw movement and tongue protrusion) in awake patients with Parkinsons disease undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery. A total of 51 single- and multi-unit neural clusters were captured. A Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) was implemented to understand the temporal dynamics of STN activity. A larger proportion of clusters was modulated during speech (22%) than during orofacial movement (12%) and a substantial subset of STN neural clusters responded to overlapping speech and orofacial tasks (27%). The findings suggest that STN can encode both motor and linguistic aspects of speech production.",

      "title": "P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels regulate calcium signaling and developmental myelination in oligodendrocyte lineage cells",
      "content": "Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) are glia that arise as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) and may persist as progenitors or differentiate into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLCs are sensitive to neuronal activity, which can influence myelin formation via activity-dependent myelination. Calcium influx in OLCs regulates many developmental processes, including stabilizing newly formed sheaths. OLCs possess P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) that contribute to calcium influx and mutations in these channels are implicated in a spectrum of neurological disorders, yet the functional significance of P/Q-type channels in OLCs is not well understood. In this study, we employ zebrafish to investigate the role of P/Q-type channels in OLCs in vivo during development. We use global and cell-type specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing approaches in conjunction with live imaging and physiology to characterize the morphology and signaling properties of OLCs with mutated P/Q-type channel genes. P/Q-type channels are required for normal myelination in the developing CNS and mutants present with decreased amplitude sheath calcium transients, reduced myelin production, shorter myelin sheaths and blebbing membrane structures during development. These findings provide new insight into the role of P/Q-type calcium channels in regulating OLC development and myelination.",

      "title": "Presynaptic GABAB autoreceptors suppress neurotransmitter release during repetitive stimulation via the G\u03b2\u03b3-SNARE pathway.",
      "content": "GABAergic signaling provides the primary inhibitory mechanism of the brain, with defects linked to epilepsy, anxiety, depression, insomnia, schizophrenia and neurodegeneration. A key regulatory mechanism is autoinhibition of GABA release during repetitive activity via presynaptic Gi/o-coupled GABAB receptors, supporting synaptic tuning and memory formation, and limiting neurotransmitter spillover. Exogenous GABAB receptor agonists reduce presynaptic Ca2+ entry by inhibiting calcium channels. However, using transgenic mice expressing a mutant SNAP25 with diminished ability to bind G{beta}{gamma} (SNAP25{delta}3), we show that suppression by GABAB autoreceptors requires intact G{beta}{gamma}-SNARE interactions. Imaging of presynaptic Ca2+ transients in GABAergic axons showed no GABA-mediated autoreceptor suppression of Ca2+ entry during stimulus trains. In contrast, application of the exogenous GABAB receptor agonist baclofen profoundly inhibited Ca2+ entry, which could be partially reversed by exogenously elevating cAMP, indicating a complementary role of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Baclofen reduced spontaneous IPSC frequency and amplitude and both effects were diminished in SNAP25{delta}3 mice, consistent with inhibition at Ca2+ channels and SNARE complexes. Physiological GABA-mediated and exogenous GABAB receptor activation thus produce distinct outcomes on GABAergic neurotransmission, indicating that synthetic drug application to neurons does not faithfully recapitulate endogenous signaling pathways. We conclude that endogenous rapid GABAB autoreceptor signaling inhibits neurotransmitter release primarily by G{beta}{gamma}-mediated inhibitions of SNARE mechanisms, whereas prolonged agonist application additionally suppresses Ca2+ influx via cAMP signaling.",

      "title": "A Unified Mechanism for Depth Perception and Figure-Ground Organization",
      "content": "Understanding how the visual system unifies depth perception and figure ground organization remains a central challenge in vision science. Stereoscopic disparity and border ownership have long been treated as distinct processes, yet both arise with similar timing in area V2 and exhibit strikingly parallel properties. Here we propose a unified mechanism that integrates both within a single hierarchical framework. Building upon the layered disparity representation introduced in our prior work, we show that border ownership, serving as the key component of figure ground organization, emerges intrinsically from thresholded relative disparity differencing, providing a unified basis for contour-based segmentation and depth perception. Using biologically constrained network models (TcNet), we demonstrate that this mechanism generalizes across binocular and illusory depth domains, bridging physical and nonepipolar disparity cues. At the systems level, we identify complementary dual feedback pathways from area V4: V4->V1, which refines and re-weights layered disparity maps, and V4->V2, which integrates global contextual priors such as shape continuity and category consistency. Together, these recurrent loops balance fine-scale depth precision with large-scale figure ground coherence, offering a unified explanation for perceptual alternations such as the Rubin Face Vase and Kanizsa illusions. This framework integrates intrinsic disparity computation, border-ownership dynamics, and hierarchical feedback modulation into a coherent, biologically plausible model. It provides a mechanistic account of how early visual areas interact with higher cortical feedback to achieve stable yet flexible perception of depth and figure ground organization within a unified temporal cycle.",

      "title": "Dorsolateral striatal acetylcholine reorganizes neural ensembles to anticipate threat",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires flexible encoding of emotional valence. Although striatal acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is critical for reinforcement learning, its contribution to aversive learning has remained poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that ACh release in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is selectively biased toward negative valence. Using fiber photometry with a genetically encoded ACh sensor, we found that ACh release robustly increased during threat prediction but decreased in anticipation of rewarding outcomes, revealing a bidirectional and valence-specific signature. Optogenetically stimulating ACh release at cue onset accelerated threat learning, impaired extinction, and shifted behavioral responding toward persistent threat expectancy. Concurrent single-cell calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation revealed that elevated ACh release dynamically reorganized DLS ensemble activity, increasing both excited and inhibited neurons and producing large-scale state-space divergence during threat cues. During extinction, optogenetically sustained ACh release preserved the organization of threat-predictive DLS ensemble activity despite the absence of shock. These findings identify DLS ACh as a valence-specific neuromodulatory signal that reconfigures striatal network dynamics, primes ensembles for impending threat, and biases learning toward threat persistence.",

      "title": "A neuron type-specific microexon in Ank3/ankyrin-G modulates calcium activity and neuronal excitability",
      "content": "Recent studies have revealed many alternative exons differentially spliced across diverse neuron types in the mammalian brain, but their links to neuronal physiology remain unclear. Here we characterize a deeply conserved microexon E35a in Ank3 encoding ankyrin-G (AnkG), a multifaceted adaptor protein best known as a master organizer of the axon initial segment (AIS) and as a leading genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder. E35a is predominantly skipped in cortical glutamatergic neurons but included in cortical GABAergic neurons and cerebellar neurons, which is dictated by multiple neuronal splicing factors. In E35a-deletion mice we generated, interneurons show increased excitability and somatic Ca2+ activity, without disruption in AIS. Biochemical analyses suggest that E35a inclusion facilitates AnkG interaction with a protein complex involving inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) important for intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Alternative splicing therefore allows AnkG to modulate neuron type-specific excitability in addition to its ubiquitous pan-neuronal role in organizing the AIS.",

      "title": "Varied monoamine reuptake inhibitors reduce parvalbumin expression; implications for pyramidal cell disinhibition and enhanced neuroplasticity",
      "content": "First-line antidepressants are effective in a significant percent of individuals but a full understanding of how these therapeutics target specific endpoints is lacking. Prior work has shown that depression is associated with hippocampal atrophy and that antidepressants can increase neurotrophin levels to increase hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal pyramidal cell (PC) spine density and arbor. These effects likely contribute to amelioration of symptoms. A less well-explored possibility is that antidepressants concomitantly disinhibit hippocampal PC activity, which could also facilitate increased PC arbor, spinogenesis and/or activity. In accordance, previous studies have shown antidepressants can attenuate stress-induced upregulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are predominantly localized to parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons and increase PV expression and neuronal activity. Though specific antidepressants have been explored for effects on regional PNN expression, the question of whether hippocampal PNN/ECM remodeling is a shared feature of varied antidepressant drugs and more importantly, of whether it is associated with significant hippocampal PV inhibition, has not been well-addressed. Herein we examine three monoamine reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, venlafaxine and viloxazine, in animal models for effects on PNN remodeling and PV expression, a proxy for PV activity. We observe shared effects of these therapeutics including the ability to increase PNN degrading effectors that can downregulate PV activity. Consistent with this, we observe shared effects of these drugs in terms of their ability to significantly reduce PV levels. These findings highlight the possibility that ECM remodeling and associated hippocampal PC disinhibition represent a shared feature of varied antidepressant medications.",

      "title": "Human cortical networks trade communication efficiency for computational reliability.",
      "content": "Brains are often described as cost-efficient communication networks, optimally balancing the cost of long connections with the benefits of fast communication. Here, inspired by the \"use it or lose it\" principle, we present a novel game-theoretic model of self-organizing neural units and show that the brain is, in fact, sub-optimal in both regards: First, we demonstrate that regional competition for connectivity under propagative communication dynamics naturally gives rise to network configurations similar to those derived from the human cortex while being even more efficient and economical. Next, we use a reservoir computing framework to compare the information processing capacity of these networks against those of the brain. Although comparable in performance, the more optimal trade-off comes with a tax on computational reliability. Through synthetic lesions, we show that these networks are fragile because, to optimize for communication, they funnel information through a spatially clustered \"oligarchy\" comprising a tight set of transmodal hubs. In contrast, the human brain uses a more distributed \"rich club\" backbone that better resists breakdown following targeted attacks, even when it means higher wiring costs and less efficient communication. This reveals a previously overlooked principle: cortical networks trade both cost and efficiency for reliable computation. Thus, our findings highlight computational reliability as another, and even more prominent driver of brain connectivity compared to wiring cost and communication efficiency.",

      "title": "Neural replay is connected to latent cause inference and supports fast generalization",
      "content": "Generalizing from previous experience in value-based tasks requires discovering and exploiting hidden structure to draw inferences beyond direct observations, and thereby update information about the values of states. We combined behavior, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling to test how latent cause inference guides neural replay, enabling fast generalization. Over two days, fifty-two participants performed a sequential decision task in which multiple visual sequences either shared a latent reward source or were associated with an independent reward. On day 1, participants learned this correlation structure and exploited it to achieve 1-shot value generalization after reversals. Multivariate decoding and sequentiality analyses revealed backward replay in visual cortex during rest intervals that was selective to unobserved reward-linked sequences, consistent with non-local value updating. In parallel, the representation of the abstract reward structure in medial temporal lobe (MTL) increased from early to late blocks on day 1. On day 2, we covertly changed which sequences shared rewards. Participants flexibly reorganized generalization, and replay patterns adapted, parallel to a reorganization of MTL representations. A LCI model captured the initial learning trajectory and adaptation upon changes in latent structure. The model captured individual differences in structure learning, and its value updating of unobserved states predicted trial-wise fluctuations in replay strength. These results provide a mechanistic account in which latent structure discovery and replay interact to propagate value and enable rapid, flexible generalization.",
