      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Predicting spiking activity from scalp EEG",
      "content": "Objective. Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we aimed to estimate spiking activity in the visual cortex using non-invasive scalp EEG. Approach. We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials. We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Main results. Although the relationship between these spectrotemporal features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, they were reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Significance. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG provides information on underlying spiking activity beyond what is available when only the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.",

      "title": "Adaptive neuromodulation dialogues: navigating current challenges and emerging innovations in neuromodulation system development",
      "content": "Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies. This article represents a synthesis of scientific, engineering, and clinical viewpoints to inform key stakeholders in the neuromodulation and brain-computer interface spaces.",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "title": "Numerical Variability of functional MRI Graph Measures",
      "content": "Network neuroscience provides a powerful framework for studying the mechanisms underlying brain-related diseases. As analyses become increasingly computational, ensuring their numerical reliability has become a critical challenge. Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes. NPVR values varied across brain regions, thresholding choices, and confound regression strategies. These findings highlight numerical variability as an important factor in functional network studies, particularly when examining subtle effects or working with small sample sizes.",

      "title": "Cellular- and systems-level profiling of amyloid-beta effects on circadian timing",
      "content": "Disruption of the circadian timing system has been reported in the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD) and is a well-characterized component of mid- and late-stage AD. Given the distributed nature of the circadian timing system, with a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks throughout the brain, understanding how AD affects this system has been challenging. To investigate how AD may disrupt circadian physiology, we focused on the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to familial early-onset AD. Using the 5xFAD mouse model and ex vivo single-cell profiling, we examined how amyloid-beta influences clock timing in both SCN neurons and hippocampal neuronal populations. Circadian profiling of 5xFAD mice (4- and 8-months-old) showed only modest changes in key clock timing properties, including a shortening of the SCN rhythm. Interestingly, the mice showed enhanced rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light cycle, suggesting that elevated amyloid-beta levels increase the sensitivity of the SCN clock to light. Further, using both in vitro SCN slice explant and dispersed SCN culture models, the exogenous administration of oligomerized amyloid-beta had no significant effect on inherent clock timing capacity. In contrast, the timing properties of cultured hippocampal neurons showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to amyloid-beta. This included an elevated mesor and an increased rhythm amplitude. These findings reveal a divergence in amyloid-beta sensitivity between the central SCN clock and peripheral oscillators. This raises the possibility that circadian disruptions in AD may stem from both the destabilization and decoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central timing properties of the SCN.",

      "title": "Deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning",
      "content": "Understanding how cognition shapes behavior across contexts remains a fundamental challenge for many disciplines. In particular, for the optimism heuristic--i.e., the tendency to overweight positive (relative to negative) information--knowledge remains fragmented, with models developed in specific domains in isolation. Here, we present a unifying computational framework by deriving the deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach discretizes reward distributions through a finite set of neurons, consistent with recent empirical findings on distributional coding in the brain. We validate our framework by reproducing established results across three iconic domains spanning individual exploration versus exploitation, social coordination, and risky choice. Beyond validation, we uncover novel interactions among optimism, reward discretization, and temporal discounting. Specifically, we identify conditions under which choice hysteresis and path-dependent strategies emerge, suggesting that perseveration results from neural reward discretization rather than constituting an independent heuristic. We further reveal \"individual dilemmas\": circumstances where agents gravitate toward suboptimal yet stable strategies, offering a mechanistic explanation for incoherent choice patterns. Our framework bridges neuroscience, psychology, and collective behavior, enabling empirically testable hypotheses about how cognitive biases propagate from individual cognition to social outcomes in complex environments.",

      "title": "Canonical Wnt signaling controls the fate and plasticity of NG2 glia in the healthy and ischemic adult mouse cortex",
      "content": "NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), exhibit unexpected plasticity in the adult brain after injury, yet the molecular cues guiding their fate remain poorly defined. Wnt signaling contributes to tissue responses following ischemic stroke, but its precise role in post-injury glial remodeling is not fully understood. Here, we define how Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling shapes NG2 glial behavior after focal cerebral ischemia. Using genetic mouse models enabling cell-specific Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological recording, we disclosed a central role for Wnt signaling in post-injury fate specification. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the oligodendroglial lineage, including a subset with an astrocyte-like transcriptional profile. Wnt signaling strongly influenced the balance between OPC proliferation and differentiation: pathway hyperactivation impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and expanded astrocyte-like NG2-derived cells, likely through concomitant activation of the Notch pathway. Remarkably, Wnt hyperactivation also induced the appearance of cholinergic neuron-like cells derived from NG2-expressing cells exclusively in the somatosensory cortex; these cells generated action potentials and exhibited sodium conductance characteristic of functional neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that NG2 glia undergo distinct fate transitions after stroke and that their lineage plasticity is highly sensitive to Wnt pathway dynamics. Targeted fine-tuning of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may enable directed redirection of NG2 glia toward specific reparative outcomes, including neuronal reprogramming, in the injured adult brain.",

      "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Willed Attention Control",
      "content": "Cueing paradigms are commonly used to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention control. In these paradigms, each trial starts with an external cue, which instructs the subject to pay covert attention to a spatial location in anticipation of an impending stimulus (instructed attention). Recent work has introduced a new type of cue which prompts the subject to spontaneously decide which spatial location to attend (willed attention). We studied the neural mechanisms of willed attention control by analyzing fMRI and EEG data recorded at two institutions (UF and UC Davis) using the same willed attention paradigm. The findings include: (1) both instructional cues and the choice cue activated the DAN, (2) the choice cue additionally activated a frontoparietal decision network consisting of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) the decision about where to attend can be decoded in frontoparietal decision network in choice trials but not in instructional trials, and (4) EEG alpha oscillation patterns immediately preceding the choice cue, but not the instructional cues, predicted the postcue direction of attention and the frontoparietal decision network activity. Based on these findings we proposed a model of willed attention control revealing how the direction of visual spatial attention was decided upon in the absence of external instructions.",

      "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of experimental pain on rat grimace scale scores",
      "content": "The rat grimace scale (RGS) purports to assess behavioural responses related to pain by assessing four facial expressions. To understand how experimental pain affects RGS scores, we conducted a systematic review of studies which reported outcomes using this scale (CRD42022292189). Systematic searches were conducted on 3 databases in January 2022. RGS studies that assessed the effects of disease models relating to pain were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using a modified version of the CAMARADES reporting checklist and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A standardised mean difference effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Fifty-four studies were included, in which 15 disease model classes and 16 classes of pharmacological interventions were identified. RGS scores were increased in disease models hypothesised to be associated with persistent pain (SMD = -4.44 [95%CI -6.25 to -2.63]) and this response was attenuated by analgesic drugs (SMD = 1.97 [95%CI 1.25 to 2.69]). Post-surgical models (39% of experiments) and opioids (30% of experiments) were the most commonly reported. We could not ascertain the sources of heterogeneity due to insufficient data. Most studies were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting quality. The relationship between RGS scores and mechanically evoked limb withdrawal was inconsistent. These findings indicate emerging evidence to support the use of RGS in persistent pain research, but additional research is needed to strengthen these findings. Future studies could benefit from using sex-balanced animal populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. To enhance the impact and reproducibility of their findings, studies should prioritise improvements in reporting quality.",

      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",
