      "title": "A mechanistic theory of planning in prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Planning is critical for adaptive behaviour in a changing world, because it lets us anticipate the future and adjust our actions accordingly. While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.",

      "title": "Exploring the impact of social relevance on the cortical tracking of speech: viability and temporal response characterisation",
      "content": "Human speech is inherently social. Yet our understanding of the neural substrates underlying continuous speech perception relies largely on neural responses to monologues, leaving substantial uncertainty about how social interactions shape the neural encoding of speech. Here, we bridge this gap by studying how EEG responses to speech change when the input includes a social element. Specifically, we compared the neural encoding of synthesised undirected monologues, directed monologues, and dialogues in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we extended this by using podcasts, addressing the additional challenges of real speech dialogue, such as dysfluencies. Using temporal response function analyses, we show that the presence of a social component strengthens envelope tracking - despite identical acoustic properties - indicating heightened listener engagement. Neural responses to synthesised speech showed a strong correlation with those for real speech podcasts, with a stronger alignment emerging for more socially-relevant speech material. In addition, we demonstrate that robust neural indices of sound and lexical-level processing can be derived using real podcast recordings despite the presence of dysfluencies. Finally, we discuss the importance of dysfluency in social speech experiments, presenting a simulation quantifying the potential impact of dysfluency on lexical level analyses. Together, these findings advance our understanding of continuous speech neurophysiology by highlighting the impact of social elements in shaping auditory neural processing in a controlled manner and providing a framework for future investigation and analysis of social speech listening and speech interaction.",

      "content": "<p><i>MiRNA</i>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <i>miRNAs</i> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <i>miR-153</i> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <i>miR-153</i> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <i>miR-153</i> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <i>miR-153</i> suppressed <i>KPNA5</i> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. These findings reveal a potential role of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in CCH-related cognitive decline.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Impact of Elovl5 Deficiency on Cerebellar Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice",
      "content": "<p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <i>Elovl5</i> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>",

      "title": "Peripheral Gating of Nociception Investigated with a Decerebrate, Arterially Perfused Preparation of the Rat",
      "content": "<p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for \"gating\" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as \"filtering,\" was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <i>N-</i>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>",

      "title": "Effects of asymmetrical postural demands on sternocleidomastoid reflex in the startReact paradigm",
      "content": "IntroductionstartReact, the rapid release of a planned movement following a startling acoustic stimulus (usually >100 dB), is widely used to assess reticulospinal tract (RST) involvement in motor control. The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) reflex within 120 ms often identifies true startle responses, i.e., responses facilitated by RSTs in the absence of cortical control. However, as the SCM is a postural muscle, its reflexive activation may be influenced by inhibitory anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), particularly during tasks with greater head/neck postural demands.MethodsWe compared SCM activation during unilateral shoulder abduction (SABD) versus hand opening (OPEN) tasks. Due to the increased asymmetrical head/neck postural demands in SABD, we hypothesized an APA-induced delay in SCM activation during SABD compared to the OPEN task, with a contralateral bias due to contralateral cortical circuits triggering APAs.ResultsOur results revealed significantly longer SCM latency\u2014exceeding the 120 ms cutoff\u2014during SABD relative to OPEN. This suggested that APAs during postural tasks, resulting from unilateral SABD, altered the expression of the startReact response. To confirm this finding, we implemented an innovative, data-driven method to determine the appropriate SCM cutoff based on the physiological difference between startle-induced SCM reflexes and task-induced SCM activation. Using this method, we observed reduced contralateral SCM reflexive activation compared to ipsilateral, during SABD but not in OPEN.DiscussionThis provides evidence for the first time that SCM reflexive activation in startReact is posture-dependent. Our novel classification method offers a robust framework for identifying true startle responses across different tasks, offering broader applicability for studies investigating RST involvement in motor control.",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Pain-related TMDs patients had weaker orofacial tactile acuity, which was consistent in gender subgroups, except for the temporal region of males. Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.",

      "content": "In the oral cavity, oral stereognosis and chemesthesis refer to the abilities to recognize shapes and detect noxious substances, respectively, through various receptors distributed on the tongue. The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",
