      "title": "The Algorithmic Regulator",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ \\Delta = K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $\\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\\Delta > 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-\\Delta}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \\emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \\emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.",

      "content": "Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) holds promise for the detection and characterisation of dementia. The Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) Study, by the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA), provides a unique resource to study deeply phenotyped neurodegenerative conditions. We present RSFC derivatives for 784 participants (data release 7 of the cohort) who were either cognitively unimpaired or diagnosed primarily with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed dementia (AD with a vascular component), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease with or without MCI or dementia, Lewy body disease or subjective cognitive impairment. Functional MRI scans were preprocessed using fMRIPrep, and time-series and whole-brain connectomes generated using three atlases at multiple resolutions, denoised using seven different techniques. High-motion artifacts were managed using a liberal quality control threshold appropriate for an older clinical population, resulting in data from 680 participants. These derivatives are made available to the research community to accelerate research on RSFC biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease, reducing duplication of effort, saving computational resources, and improving standardisation across studies.",

      "title": "Perceiving surface colour requires attention",
      "content": "Colour constancy refers to our ability to distinguish changes in surface properties from changes in the properties of light illuminating the scene. The apparent ease with which we can tell that objects do not change colour, for example, when moving from sunlight to the shade, belies the complexity of solving this ill-constrained problem. Although there is a substantial body of work testing which image cues might be used to accomplish this, there is surprisingly little known of how the brain performs this computation. Here, we tested a fundamental aspect of this perceptual process: whether it requires attention. We measured visual search times for both surface colour (requiring separation of surface and illuminant properties) and 'raw', colorimetric colour (which does not). We found a clear difference between the two: visual search for colorimetric colour was fast and near-parallel, while search for surface colour was slow and consistent with the serial deployment of attention. That is, search times suggest that the perceptual separation of surface and illuminant properties in colour constancy may require an attention-based process analogous to perceiving conjunctions of simple features in 'feature binding'. Colour discrimination thresholds suggested that while colorimetric colour detection is fast and parallel, once attention was directed to these stimuli and perceptual scission occurs, colorimetric colour information was discarded by the visual system. These results offer important new insights into the sequence of processes the brain uses to accomplish colour constancy.",

      "content": "Coordination serves as a fundamental driving force in the evolution of human society, and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its ability to modulate human coordination. However, the neural mechanisms underlying coordination and whether tES positively influences it remain under investigation. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of interbrain synchronization (IBS) and the neural efficiency enhancement of the mirror neuron system (MNS) using single...",

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this ability, termed interoception, are not fully understood. Converging evidence suggests that cardiac rhythms are linked to frontal brain activity, particularly oscillations in the delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) band, but their causal relationship remained elusive. Here, we identified a frontal network of delta...",
