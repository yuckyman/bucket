      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "The Earlier You Know, the Smoother You Act",
      "content": "Intercepting a moving object with our hands requires that the moving object and the hand come into contact at some point along the object's trajectory. Hand movement must, therefore, be planned in advance so that the hand reaches a chosen spatial location along this trajectory at the correct moment in time. To enable such anticipatory behavior, the object's trajectory must be predicted based on sensory information collected before movement planning is concluded. Early completion of planning would allow for a smooth and economical movement; however, it also requires sufficiently accurate information about the object's movement to be available earlier. We investigate interception in the context of a complex, naturalistic motor task, toss juggling, to understand the extent to which proprioceptive and tactile information influence anticipatory movements of the catching hand. In our study, we compared solo juggling, where the efferent, tactile and proprioceptive information from the throwing hand is available during catch planning, with dyadic juggling, a functionally ''deafferented'' condition where no such information is available because the ball has been thrown by another person. Our results indicate that when internal and tactile information from the toss is absent, anticipatory behavior is greatly reduced. Experienced jugglers seem to rely more strongly on internal information than vision, allowing earlier planning and lower target uncertainty. In the dyadic condition, when internal information is absent, trajectory planning is delayed, leading to greater target uncertainty.",

      "content": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal -synucleinopathy characterized by progressive parkinsonism, cerebellar and autonomic dysfunction. Currently, the mechanisms driving cerebellar white matter neuroinflammation and degeneration in MSA are poorly understood. Here, we identified fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) as a key factor regulating cerebellar inflammation in MSA pathogenesis in a detailed study of human, mouse and cultured astrocytes. Firstly, transcriptomic profiling of human MSA cerebellar white matter revealed activation of pro-inflammatory and ferroptotic pathways, with FABP5 identified as a key pathway component that is upregulated. We confirmed that FABP5 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes in the PLP--syn transgenic mouse model, also in LPS-treated primary astrocytes. Fabp5 silencing suppressed TNF signaling, mitigated ferroptosis, and restored mitochondrial function. These findings suggest astrocytic FABP5 as a central intracellular regulator linking glial inflammation, ferroptosis, and mitochondrial injury. Overall, this mechanism suggests that FABP5 drives pathology mediated by astrocytes oligodendroglia in MSA, therefore representing a novel and promising therapeutic target.",

      "content": "Preprocessing and analysis of neuroimaging data are technically demanding, often requiring a combination of multiple software tools, modality-specific pipelines, and extensive parameter tuning to match dataset characteristics. These complexities make it difficult to document workflows in sufficient detail to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce QuNex recipes, a framework for defining and executing complete neuroimaging workflows -- encompassing data onboarding, preprocessing, and analysis -- in a transparent, machine- and human-readable format. Recipes are implemented as an integrated feature of the Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & Toolbox (QuNex), a containerized, open-source platform for end-to-end multimodal and multi-species neuroimaging processing. The recipes framework enables seamless integration of QuNex commands with custom scripts and external tools, capturing every processing step and parameter setting. A fully reproducible study can thus be shared and replicated by providing only (a) the QuNex version used, (b) the recipe file, and (c) the data. This approach standardizes workflow specification, enhances transparency, and enables one-command replication of complex neuroimaging analyses. By providing a standardized way to describe and share workflows, recipes facilitate open exchange of best practices and reproducible methods within the neuroimaging community.",

      "title": "Activation of IRF7/ISG15 axis in microglia inhibits NLRP3 Expression and Improves the Prognosis of Ischemia/Reperfusion in Mice",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality, with neuroinflammation playing a key role in post-stroke injury. The molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined. This study explored the functions of IRF7 and its downstream target ISG15 in stroke-associated neuroinflammation and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic datasets from microglia and ischemic brain tissues identified both molecules as hub genes. Their expression was validated in a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and in microglial cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). The effects of these molecules were assessed using siRNA knockdown, conditioned media assays with SY5Y neuronal cells, in vivo overexpression of ISG15, histological and functional assessments. Both IRF7 and ISG15 were significantly upregulated after stroke. IRF7 knockdown reduced ISG15 expression, whereas ISG15 knockdown did not affect IRF7, suggesting a unidirectional regulatory relationship. Conditioned media from microglia treated with siIRF7 or siISG15 increased SY5Y cell mortality, with a stronger effect in the siISG15 group, highlighting neuroprotective role of ISG15. ISG15 knockdown also enhanced microglial migration. Conversely, microglial ISG15 overexpression in vivo promoted a shift toward reduced neuroinflammation, improved neuronal survival, and enhanced functional recovery. Mechanistically, ISG15 stabilized NLRP3 protein but more strongly decreased its mRNA stability through accelerated degradation. These findings demonstrate that the activation of IRF7/ISG15 axis in microglia inhibits NLRP3 Expression and improve the prognosis of ischemia/reperfusion in mice, with ISG15 exerting stronger neuroprotective effects. Targeting microglial ISG15 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",
