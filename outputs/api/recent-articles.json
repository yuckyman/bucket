      "title": "PDC Struct: Pydantic-Powered Binary Serialization for Python",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've just released <strong>PDC Struct</strong> (Pydantic Data Class Struct), a library that lets you define binary structures using Pydantic models and Python type hints. If you've ever needed to parse network packets, read binary file formats, or communicate with C programs, this might save you some headaches.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pdc-struct/\">https://pypi.org/project/pdc-struct/</a> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/boxcake/pdc_struct\">https://github.com/boxcake/pdc_struct</a> - Documentation: <a href=\"https://boxcake.github.io/pdc_struct/\">https://boxcake.github.io/pdc_struct/</a></p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>PDC Struct lets you define binary data structures as Pydantic models and automatically serialize/deserialize them:</p> <p>```python from pdc_struct import StructModel, StructConfig, ByteOrder from pdc_struct.c_types import UInt8, UInt16, UInt32</p> <p>class ARPPacket(StructModel): hw_type: UInt16 proto_type: UInt16 hw_size: UInt8 proto_size: UInt8 opcode: UInt16 sender_mac: bytes = Field(struct_length=6) sender_ip: bytes = Field(struct_length=4) target_mac: bytes = Field(struct_length=6) target_ip: bytes = Field(struct_length=4)</p> <pre><code>struct_config = StructConfig(byte_order=ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN) </code></pre> <h1>Parse raw bytes</h1> <p>packet = ARPPacket.from_bytes(raw_data) print(f&quot;Opcode: {packet.opcode}&quot;)</p> <h1>Serialize back to bytes</h1> <p>binary = packet.to_bytes() # Always 28 bytes ```</p> <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Type-safe</strong>: Full Pydantic validation, type hints, IDE autocomplete</li> <li><strong>C-compatible</strong>: Produces binary data matching C struct layouts</li> <li><strong>Configurable byte order</strong>: Big-endian, little-endian, or native</li> <li><strong>Bit fields</strong>: Pack multiple values into single bytes with <code>BitFieldModel</code></li> <li><strong>Nested structs</strong>: Compose complex structures from simpler ones</li> <li><strong>Two modes</strong>: Fixed-size C-compatible mode, or flexible dynamic mode with optional fields</li> </ul> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This is aimed at developers who work with:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Network protocols</strong> - Parsing/creating packets (ARP, TCP headers, custom protocols)</li> <li><strong>Binary file formats</strong> - Reading/writing structured binary files (WAV headers, game saves, etc.)</li> <li><strong>Hardware/embedded systems</strong> - Communicating with sensors, microcontrollers over serial/I2C</li> <li><strong>C interoperability</strong> - Exchanging binary data between Python and C programs</li> <li><strong>Reverse engineering</strong> - Quickly defining structures for binary analysis</li> </ul> <p>If you've ever written <code>struct.pack('&gt;HHBBH6s4s6s4s', ...)</code> and then struggled to remember what each field was, this is for you.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p><strong>vs. <code>struct</code> module (stdlib)</strong></p> <p>The <code>struct</code> module is powerful but low-level. You're working with format strings and tuples:</p> <p>```python</p> <h1>struct module</h1> <p>data = struct.pack('&gt;HH', 1, 0x0800) hw_type, proto_type = struct.unpack('&gt;HH', data) ```</p> <p>PDC Struct gives you named fields, validation, and type safety:</p> <p>```python</p> <h1>pdc_struct</h1> <p>packet = ARPPacket(hw_type=1, proto_type=0x0800, ...) packet.hw_type # IDE knows this is an int ```</p> <p><strong>vs. <code>ctypes.Structure</code></strong></p> <p><code>ctypes</code> is designed for C FFI, not general binary serialization. It's tied to native byte order and doesn't integrate with Pydantic's validation ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>vs. <code>construct</code></strong></p> <p>Construct is a mature declarative parser, but uses its own DSL rather than Python classes. PDC Struct uses standard Pydantic models, so you get: - Native Python type hints - Pydantic validation, serialization, JSON schema - IDE autocomplete and type checking - Familiar class-based syntax</p> <p><strong>vs. <code>dataclasses</code> + manual packing</strong></p> <p>You could use dataclasses and write your own <code>to_bytes()</code>/<code>from_bytes()</code> methods, but that's boilerplate for every struct. PDC Struct handles it automatically.</p> <hr /> <p>Happy to answer any questions or hear feedback. The library has comprehensive docs with examples for ARP packet parsing, C interop, and IoT sensor communication.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/9011442\"> /u/9011442 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe2hfx/pdc_struct_pydanticpowered_binary_serialization/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe2hfx/pdc_struct_pydanticpowered_binary_serialization/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Also, I'm simultaneously deploying to web and desktop, and streamlit lets me do this with just the one codebase (I intend to use something like PyInstaller for distribution)</p> <p>I have different &quot;<a href=\"https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.expander\">expanders</a>&quot; in my streamlit application. Each expander has some data/input elements in it (in the case of my most recent problem, it's a <code>data_editor</code>). Sometimes, I need one element to update in response to the user clicking on &quot;Save Changes&quot; in a different part of the application. If they were both in the same fragment, I could just do <code>st.rerun(scope='fragment')</code>. But since they're not, I have no other choice but to do <code>st.rerun()</code>. But if there's incorrect input, I write an error message, which gets subsequently erased due to the rerun. Now I know that I can store this stuff in <code>st.session_state</code> and add additional logic to &quot;recreate&quot; the (prior) error-message state of the app, but that adds a lot of complexity.</p> <p>Since there is no way to <code>st.rerun()</code> a different fragment than the one I'm in, it looks like I have to give up streamlit - about time, I've been writing workarounds/hacks for a lot of streamlit stumbling blocks.</p> <p>So, would anyone be able to recommend an alternative to streamlit? These are the criteria to determine viability of an alternative:</p> <ol> <li>ability to control the layout of my elements and programmatically refresh specific elements on demand</li> <li>web and desktop deployments from the same codebase <ol> <li>bonus points for being able to handle mobile deployments as well</li> </ol></li> <li>Python API - I can learn another language if the learning curve is fast. That takes Node/React out of the realm of possibility</li> <li>somewhat mature - I started using streamlit back in v0.35 or so. But now I'm using v1.52. While streamlit hasn't been around for as long as React, v1.52 is sufficiently mature. I doubt a flashy new frontend framework (eg: with current version 0.43) would have had enough time to iron out the bugs if it's only been around for a very short period of time (eg: 6 months).</li> <li>ideally something you have experience with and can therefore speak confidently to its stability/reliability</li> </ol> <p>I'm currently considering: 1. <a href=\"https://flet.dev/\">flet</a>: hasn't been around for very long - anyone know if it's any good? 1. <a href=\"https://nicegui.io\">NiceGUI</a> 1. <a href=\"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex\">Reflex</a></p> <p>If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I'd love them</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/inspectorG4dget\"> /u/inspectorG4dget </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdz1qu/please_recommend_a_frontend_frameworkpackage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdz1qu/please_recommend_a_frontend_frameworkpackage/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I now have the project in a stable state where I need more feedback on real-life usage and testing.</p> <p>Here are some examples of it in action:</p> <h2>Simple API</h2> <p>```python from clientele import api</p> <p>client = api.APIClient(base_url=&quot;<a href=\"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2%22\">https://pokeapi.co/api/v2&quot;</a>)</p> <p>@client.get(&quot;/pokemon/{pokemon_name}&quot;) def get_pokemon_info(pokemon_name: str, result: dict) -&gt; dict: return result ```</p> <h2>Simple POST request</h2> <p>```python from clientele import api</p> <p>client = api.APIClient(base_url=&quot;<a href=\"https://httpbin.org%22\">https://httpbin.org&quot;</a>)</p> <p>@client.post(&quot;/post&quot;) def post_input_data(data: dict, result: dict) -&gt; dict: return result ```</p> <h2>Streaming responses</h2> <p>```python from typing import AsyncIterator from pydantic import BaseModel from clientele import api</p> <p>client = api.APIClient(base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;)</p> <p>class Event(BaseModel): text: str</p> <p>@client.get(&quot;/events&quot;, streaming_response=True) async def stream_events(*, result: AsyncIterator[Event]) -&gt; AsyncIterator[Event]: return result ```</p> <p>New features include:</p> <ul> <li>Handle streaming responses for Server Sent Events</li> <li>Handle custom response parsing with callbacks</li> <li>Sensible HTTP caching decorator with extendable backends</li> <li>A Mypy plugin to handle the way the library injects parameters</li> <li>Many many tweaks and updates to handle edge-case OpenAPI schemas</li> </ul> <p>Please star \u2b50 the project, give it a download and let me know what you think: <a href=\"https://github.com/phalt/clientele\">https://github.com/phalt/clientele</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phalt_\"> /u/phalt_ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdo37p/follow_up_clientele_an_api_integration_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdo37p/follow_up_clientele_an_api_integration_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",
