      "title": "Divalent cation depletion enhances neuronal excitability through CaSR-dependent modulation of threshold channels",
      "content": "External calcium ([Ca2+]e) and magnesium ([Mg2+]e) concentrations fluctuate across physiological and pathological brain states. For example, [Ca2+]e; decreases during intense neuronal activity and epilepsy, whereas it rises during sleep. Similarly, [Mg2+]e; varies with the sleep/wake cycle and is reduced in epilepsy. Lowering either [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e increases intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the action potential (AP) threshold, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we confirm that reducing [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e enhances intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the AP threshold of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Physiological reductions in [Mg2+]e (0.8 to 0.4 mM) have minimal effect, whereas decreases from supraphysiological levels (2.0 to 0.4 mM) robustly increase excitability. Using pharmacology and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identify the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) as a key mediator of these effects. The calcilytic NPS-2143 mimics and largely occludes both the intrinsic excitability increase and the AP-threshold hyperpolarization, while genetic reduction of CaSR produces similar outcomes. We further show that AP-threshold hyperpolarization induced by low divalent cations involves both Kv1 and Nav1.2 channels. Together, these findings reveal CaSR as a critical link between external divalent cation levels and intrinsic neuronal excitability through the modulation of Kv1 and Nav channels.",

      "title": "The representation of object concepts across the brain",
      "content": "The mechanisms supporting concrete object concepts remain elusive. Here, macaque monkeys spent years learning object-concept primitives defined by color and shape. During fMRI, the monkeys held in mind one concept feature cued by the other. Using a whole-brain searchlight, we observed cross-feature decoding not in retinotopic cortex, but bilaterally in anterior inferior temporal cortex (aIT), temporal pole (TP), and frontal cortex (FC). Only TP and aIT had response patterns to concept shapes matching color-space geometry, and only PF had responses that decode behavioral errors. Two additional imaging experiments showed that color-associated versus non-color-associated shapes, and color-shape combinations congruent versus incongruent with the concepts, were distinguished only by extrastriate visual cortex, suggesting extrastriate cortex underpins color perception and perceptual feature binding. Together, the results provide a blueprint for how the brain generates stable object concepts and provides hypotheses for how conceptual representations engage perceptual representations through selective feedback during vision.",

      "title": "Restoring Amyloid Clearance via Astrocytes: Z17 Is a Selective Inhibitor of CHI3L1 in Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, accumulation of hallmark protein aggregates and substantial neuroinflammation. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) which is predominantly produced by activated astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Overexpression of CHI3L1 has been implicated with AD progression and worsening of symptoms. Herein, we report the identification of Z17 as a novel and selective CHI3L1 inhibitor which directly bind to CHI3L1 an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 6.0 M. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, Z17 acted as a dual-action regulator by reinstating astrocytic function and suppressing inflammation. Additionally, Z17 rescued CHI3L1-induced impairment by dose-dependently restoring A{beta} uptake and normalizing lysosomal proteolytic activity and pH. Furthermore, Z17 effectively blocked CHI3L1-driven activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in human astrocytes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the functional rescue. The in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of Z17 demonstrated favorable drug-like properties for CNS development. These findings support the advancement of Z17 as a selective CHI3L1 inhibitor capable of simultaneously mitigating neuroinflammation and restoring astrocytic clearance mechanisms, making it a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Alzheimers disease.",

      "title": "Age-specific A\u03b2-Tau interactions underlie spatial memory deficits in an APP/PS1 amyloidosis model",
      "content": "Background: Amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau pathology are key molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet how their interaction contributes to cognitive decline remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between Ab burden, tau pathology, presynaptic density, and spatial learning and memory in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic (TG) mouse model of amyloidosis. Methods: Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Barnes maze test in male TG and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, aged 6, 12, and 18 months. Gross visual function was assessed indirectly in 18-month-old animals using the light/dark exploration test. Brains were collected for autoradiography of tau pathology and presynaptic density with [18F]Flortaucipir and [3H]UCB-J, respectively, while Ab plaque load was measured by immunohistochemistry. Correlation and linear mixed-effects regression analyses were used to assess relationships between behavioral and pathological measures. Results: APP/PS1 mice showed normal cognitive performance at 6 months, a selective long-term memory deficit at 12 months, and severe impairments in learning and retention at 18 months, independent of visual confounds. Age-dependent increases in [18F]Flortaucipir binding and Ab plaque load were observed in all brain regions of TG compared to WT mice, whereas [3H]UCB-J binding was increased in a region-dependent manner in 18-month-old TG vs. WT animals. Barnes maze performance during the final day of testing correlated negatively with both Ab and tau pathology across all areas examined. Linear regression revealed a significant association between tau and age and between tau and Ab in the cortex, indicating that memory decline in ageing TG mice was driven by the combined effects of these pathologies. Conclusions: Deficits in memory retention precede impairments in task learning performance in APP/PS1 mice. Spontaneous tau accumulation contributes to the progressive cognitive decline, capturing key aspects of the Ab-tau interaction observed in human AD.",

      "content": "The pupillary light response was once considered a brainstem reflex, but newer findings indicate that pupil dilation can also reflect content held 'in mind' with working memory (WM). This suggests that WM may recruit even the earliest sensorimotor apparatus for maintenance. Here, we tested two boundaries of this pupillary WM response: whether it generalizes beyond low-level stimuli and whether it adapts to changing behavioral goals. Namely, we tested whether the pupils reflect remembered brightness for realworld scene images, and whether the effect varies when different features dimensions are emphasized for the memory test (i.e., visual detail vs. semantic category). We found a feature-specific pupillary WM effect for remembering natural scenes, but only when the task encouraged a visual maintenance strategy. Rather than a retrospective echo of sensory-evoked stimulus features, the pupillary WM response prospectively adapts to how the memory content will be used.",

      "title": "The Psychedelic Psilocin Suppresses Activity of Central Amygdala Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 Neurons and Decreases Ethanol Drinking in Female Mice",
      "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>",

      "title": "Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories",
      "content": "<p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>",

      "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity to Visual Sequences in Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reflects Familiarity",
      "content": "<p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity (\"sequence plasticity\") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that \"sequence plasticity\" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>",

The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC&ndash;hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration.

      "content": "<p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Aperiodic Activity Reflects Pathologic Waveform Shapes in Focal Epilepsy",
      "content": "<p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<i><sup></sup></i> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>",
