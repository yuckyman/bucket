      "title": "Dynamic Reversal of IT-PFC Information Flow Orchestrates Visual Categorization Under Perceptual Uncertainty",
      "content": "Categorization relies on a dynamic interplay between sensory representation and cognitive control, yet the classical view posits a fixed, feed-forward (FF) information flow from Inferotemporal (IT) to Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Whether and how this hierarchical directionality adapts to cognitive context, such as perceptual certainty, remains a fundamental question. We investigated this question in monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-category task using intracranial recording and a novel connectivity analysis: Model-Based Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA). This approach allowed us to simultaneously track the content, timing, and directionality of information flow between IT and PFC, while controlling for common task-general representations. Our Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) revealed that while both areas rapidly encoded the task-relevant information, IT coding was earlier and transient, whereas PFC exhibited stronger, sustained coding and content-specific recurrence during the memory delay, reflecting active maintenance of the category rule. Crucially, the directionality of information flow was highly modulated by stimulus certainty. For high-certainty stimuli (Far from the category boundary), we observed the classical, predicted feed-forward flow (IT -> PFC). However, for low-certainty stimuli (Close to the category boundary), this hierarchy dynamically reversed, with a dominant, early feedback (FB) flow (PFC -> IT), preceding the feed-forward sweep. This FB signal carried information related to the ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a top-down mechanism to enhance sensory representations. These results challenge fixed-hierarchy models of categorization, providing mechanistic evidence that the brain dynamically reconfigures the direction of information flow between sensory and executive areas as a function of perceptual difficulty. We propose that the PFC initiates a top-down biasing signal to IT when sensory evidence is ambiguous, thus serving as an adaptive, context-driven control mechanism.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "content": "The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of the neurophysiological response to sound, widely used in clinical and research settings. In this manuscript, we describe an open-source and low-cost system suitable for measuring the ABR in mice. (This system is not evaluated or approved for clinical use in humans.) The heart of the system is the commercially available Texas Instruments ADS1299 chip, which is designed for multi-channel differential recording of biosignals. We designed auxiliary hardware and software to record and visualize the ABR. To demonstrate that this system is capable of high-quality and low-noise measurements, we recorded the response to free-field auditory clicks from the left and right. Next, we compared different electrode configurations, quantified the most consistent aspects of the ABR, and assessed variability within and across mice. Finally, we demonstrated how to detect the decreased auditory sensitivity caused by surgically induced conductive hearing loss. Users can deploy this open-source system at low cost and customize it for different applications, such as recording other biosignals like electromyography (EMG) or electrocardiography (ECG).",

      "content": "Early life adversity is a major risk factor for mental disorders later in life. Genetic and individual differences modulate the impact of early life trauma and stress on adult mental health, emphasizing the importance of understanding how the early onset of individual differences may shape behavioral outcomes across life. In rodents, genetic differences can be studied using inbred rodent strains or substrains. While C57BL/6 mouse substrains differ in their adult fear behavior, it is unclear when in development these differences emerge. Here we compared the ontogenesis of remote auditory fear retrieval, spontaneous recovery and renewal in the mouse C57BL/6J (Jax, from Jackson Laboratories) and C57BL/6NTac (Taconic Biosciences) substrains spanning postnatal days (P)16, P18, P21, P25 and P30. Taconic male and female mice show an earlier onset of persistent auditory fear memory and spontaneous recovery (females only) compared to Jax mice. Male Taconic mice also display earlier onset of renewal compared to Jax males. These data identify ontogenetic differences in fear processing among C57BL/6 mouse substrains, highlighting how individual differences can contribute to altered behavioral phenotypes in early development.",

      "title": "Excellent agreement between automated deep learning-based and manual DWI infarct volume measurement in hyperacute stroke",
      "content": "Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume and infarct growth are important imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke, but manual volume measurement is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning (DL)-based automated segmentation may facilitate rapid assessment; however, its performance on hyperacute DWI has not been sufficiently assessed. The aim was to evaluate the agreement between DL-based automated and manual infarct volume measurements and to compare their ability to predict clinical outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Method: Consecutive MT-treated patients (September 2014-December 2019) who underwent DWI at admission and at approximately 24 hours were retrospectively analyzed. Manual infarct volume was measured by stroke neurologists. Automated measurements were obtained using DL-based software. Agreement was assessed using Pearson?s correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1). Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were evaluated in a randomly selected subgroup of 150 patients. Predictive ability for a good outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score 0?2 or stable/improved from premorbid status) was compared using C-statistics and DeLong's test. Results: A total of 371 patients (677 DWI scans) were included. Manual and automated measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.96) with minimal bias (?1.77 mL). The ICC for manual-automated agreement was 0.959 (95% CI, 0.952-0.965), comparable to inter- and intra-rater ICCs. Agreement remained high across onset-to-imaging times and lesion sizes. Predictive abilities for a good outcome were similar for manual and automated admission DWI volume (C-statistics 0.867 vs. 0.861) and infarct growth (0.859 vs. 0.853). Manual follow-up DWI volume showed slightly better predictive ability than automated measurement (0.880 vs. 0.866). Conclusion: DL-based automated infarct volume measurement shows excellent agreement with experienced clinicians, with predictive performance comparable to manual assessment. Automated DWI-based quantification is reliable and feasible for use in hyperacute stroke management.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Retrieval-related eye movements are predictive of memory precision",
      "content": "Eye movements are predictive of successful episodic memory encoding and retrieval, but it is unclear whether they reflect the precision of retrieved memory content. Here, we examined relationships between eye fixations, memory precision and fMRI BOLD activity. At study, participants were presented with object images, each placed at a random location on an invisible circle. At test, both studied and new images were presented. Participants were instructed to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image, recall and then signal its studied location, guessing if necessary. Simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking data were acquired during the test phase. For correctly recognized images, the trial-wise angular distance between the studied and reported locations was fitted to a two-component mixture model. Based on the model-derived parameters, correctly recognized images were categorized as those associated with successful location retrieval (location hits) or guesses. Location hits were further divided into high- and low precision trials. At retrieval, fixations predicted both successful retrieval and the precision of the retrieved location memory. Additionally, across-trial fixation patterns were more similar for location hits than for guesses, and for high- than for low-precision trials. The association between retrieval success and eye fixation precision was evident across almost the entire recall phase, whereas memory precision effects emerged around 1-1.5s after image onset. Fixation precision and fixation pattern similarity each predicted trial-wise memory precision independently of hippocampal BOLD activity, which also predicted precision. These findings suggest that eye fixations during retrieval track the fidelity of mnemonic content.",

      "title": "Gelatinase activity is required for Muller glia morphogenesis and neuronal maintenance in the retina",
      "content": "Glial cells are indispensable support elements of the nervous system, yet the mechanisms by which they integrate into densely packed, extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich environments remain poorly understood. In the retina, Muller glia (MG) serve as the principal support cells, performing roles analogous to astrocytes in the brain. As late-born retinal cells, MG undergo morphogenesis within a complex extracellular milieu composed of neighbouring neurons, synapses, and ECM components. Using the zebrafish retina, we show that developing MG dynamically interact with the ECM across all retinal layers while expressing the ECM-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp) 2 and 9. Although Mmps are known to contribute to tissue remodelling and disease processes such as glioma invasion, their developmental roles in glia remain less defined. Here, we demonstrate that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are required for MG morphogenesis and glia-neuron integration. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of mmp2 and mmp9 impaired MG outgrowth and reduced process complexity within synaptic layers, leading to decreased MG-synapse associations. Double mutants (mmp2-/-;mmp9-/-) displayed normal neuronal development and visual function at larval stages but exhibited gliosis, premature neurodegeneration, and visual deficits in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are critical for establishing MG-synapse interactions during development and for maintaining neuronal integrity and visual function in the mature retina.",

      "title": "Two-photon in vivo imaging reveals cell type-specific mitophagy dynamic changes in mouse somatosensory cortex during aging",
      "content": "Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained through mitochondrial autophagy, a process commonly known as mitophagy. Recent research has begun to highlight the region- and cell type-specific nature of mitophagy during brain aging; however, these dynamics have largely remained unexplored in living brains. To address this gap, we conducted two-photon mt-Keima imaging in somatosensory cortical neurons and astrocytes in behaving mice across two age groups. Our observations revealed a reduction in mitophagy levels in both cell types during aging, and we consistently found a higher level of mitophagy in astrocytes compared to neurons across both age groups, indicating a cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics that is independently of the aging process. NAD+ augmentation improved mitophagy level in both neurons and astrocytes in old-aged mice at the dose and method of administration tested. Collectively, our data underscore the critical importance of both neuronal and astrocytic metabolic roles in brain aging. The findings also suggest that NAD+ repletion has clinical value in potentially improving these cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics during aging.",

      "title": "PPAR\u03b4 activation in microglia drives a transcriptional response that primes phagocytic function while countering inflammatory activation",
      "content": "Microglia have been implicated in neurodegeneration, though their role remains unclear, as microglia can perform protective functions or promote neuroinflammation. Numerous studies have found that the transcriptome state of microglia can indicate where they lie along this continuum. To understand regulation of microglia transcriptome state, we considered the transcription factor PPAR{delta}, because it is highly expressed in microglia and is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease, (AD) a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss where microglia dysfunction is involved. When we delineated the microglia transcriptome in mice treated with PPAR{delta} agonist, we noted that PPAR{delta} activation blunted expression of inflammatory mediators and migration-enhancing genes, while boosting phagocytic genes. We then examined PPAR{delta} function in induced transcription factor (iTF) microglia-like cells, and confirmed PPAR{delta} agonism increases phagocyte function while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and migration. To understand PPAR{delta} regulation upon CNS insult, we exposed iTF-microglia to apoptotic neuron debris and defined six microglia transcriptome states as a function of PPAR{delta} activation, and observed PPAR{delta} agonism can shift microglia out of a homeostatic state to a primed, disease-associated microglia-like state. As PPAR{delta} agonism opposed gene expression favored by PU.1, a critical transcription factor in microglial inflammation and AD pathogenesis, we examined their relationship, documented a physical interaction, and found evidence for transrepression. Finally, we tested PPAR{delta} agonism in Huntington's disease and tauopathy mice, and demonstrated PPAR{delta} could decrease neuroinflammation in vivo. These findings suggest that PPAR{delta} agonist therapy may mitigate microglial dysfunction by restoring beneficial functions, while suppressing detrimental inflammation.",

      "title": "FLIM-FRET Imaging of AMPA Receptors: New Principle for Subtype-Specific Elucidation",
      "content": "-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and their subunit composition (GluA1-4) critically shapes synaptic strength and plasticity. Discriminating AMPAR subtypes at the molecular level remains challenging with conventional techniques. Here, we applied Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) combined with fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to resolve subtype-specific AMPAR assemblies. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and HALO domain were genetically introduced into GluA1-3 subunits to make intrareceptor FRET pairs. Self-labeling protein (SLP) domains such as SNAP and HALO were used with cell-impermeable substrates to selectively label surface-expressed receptors. This approach identified di-heterotetrameric GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 assemblies at the HEK293T cell membrane, whereas GluA1/3 failed to form di-heteromers. These findings demonstrate the FLIM-FRET method as a tool for differentiating AMPAR subtypes in living cells, providing a foundation for studying subtype-specific receptor organization in excitatory synapses.",
