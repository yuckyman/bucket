      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "The protein interactome of the Neuron Specific Gene family (NSG1-3)",
      "content": "The Neuron-Specific Gene (NSG) family members (NSG1-3) play critical and diverse roles in neuronal protein trafficking, but their precise molecular functions remain poorly understood. Here, we employed proximity-labeling proteomics to map the interactomes of each NSG protein. Unlabeled mass spectrometry identified over 1,000 significantly enriched interactors compared with a cytoplasmic control, revealing substantial overlap between NSG1 and NSG2, and a more divergent profile for NSG3. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis confirmed established associations with glutamatergic synapses and endosomal trafficking, while also uncovering unexpected links to presynaptic machinery, inhibitory synapses, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein translation, particularly for NSG3. Reciprocal biotinylation patterns and co-immunoprecipitation revealed novel heteromeric complex formation between NSG1 and NSG2, with limited interactions involving NSG3. All three NSGs biotinylated core AMPA receptor subunits and auxiliary proteins, while NSG1 and NSG2 also associated with NMDA receptors, GABA receptor subunits, as well as multiple presynaptic proteins. Moreover, NSG1 and NSG2 specifically biotinylated components of multiunit tethering complexes including neuron-specific retromer, and biotinylated a preponderance of ADAM10 substrates, reinforcing their role in proteolytic processing. Finally, despite the relatively divergent interactomes of NSG1 and NSG2 compared to NSG3, all family members robustly biotinylated amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting possible synergistic or competitive interactions that could shape APP proteolytic processing and/or trafficking. Together, these data provide a comprehensive systems-level view of NSG protein interactions, establishing a molecular framework for future investigations into NSG-mediated neural plasticity and disease mechanisms.",

      "title": "Equiluminant Border Ownership Cells as a Missing Link in Color Form Perception",
      "content": "We propose the existence of a sub-population of border ownership neurons that signal figure side along equiluminant borders, those defined purely by color contrast. We postulate that these neurons, similar to primate equiluminant V1 [26] and V4 [5] cells, are strongly activated by equiluminant contrast on their preferred side, with diminished response for strictly luminance contrast. To test this hypothesis, we propose a hierarchical and mechanistic model that explains how equiluminant border ownership signals can be achieved in the ventral stream. Our simulation results suggest that model equiluminant neurons are highly color-selective while exhibiting similar orientation and border ownership selectivity as their luminance counterparts. Additionally, our model equiluminant cells indeed exhibited the above postulated pattern of responses. We suggest that these neurons are the missing links in the equiluminance channels in the ventral stream that transform equiluminant oriented edge signals in V1 to equiluminant object-centered shape representations in V4. Our findings point to the importance of re-examining the border ownership neuron population to further detail their role in equiluminant channels in the ventral stream.",

      "title": "NMDA receptor ablation in medial prefrontal cortex disrupts value updating and reward history integration",
      "content": "Schizophrenia, a serious mental illness, is associated with evidence of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction and characterized by cognitive impairments that reflect impaired value updating and feedback-driven control; however the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying these disruptions remain unclear. Here we test how NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contributes to adaptive decision-making by combining targeted genetic ablation in mice and systemic pharmacology. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to eliminate the obligate GluN1 subunit, we induced spatially confined NMDAR hypofunction in mPFC and compared its effects to systemic pharmacological blockade with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 during performance of a touchscreen-based restless bandit task. Prefrontal NMDAR ablation impaired value discrimination, weakened the use of negative feedback, and reduced mutual information between recent outcomes and current choices, indicating disrupted reward-history integration. Reinforcement-learning models incorporating a choice-kernel term best captured behavior and revealed that NMDAR ablation selectively dampened learning and choice-history parameters governing flexible updating. Systemic MK-801 produced broad impairments in control animals, reducing accuracy, mutual information, and outcome sensitivity, yet exerted only modest additional effects after NMDAR ablation, suggesting that prefrontal NMDAR loss occluded much of the pharmacological disruption. Simulations using fitted RLCK parameters reproduced these patterns, showing convergent flattening of choice dynamics under MK-801 and persistent deficits in GluN1 ablated animals. Together, these findings demonstrate that prefrontal NMDAR signaling is necessary for effective value updating and feedback-driven learning, and that its loss recapitulates core features of systemic NMDAR hypofunction. This work establishes a mechanistic bridge between localized cortical glutamatergic dysfunction and the reinforcement-learning disturbances characteristic of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Divalent cation depletion enhances neuronal excitability through CaSR-dependent modulation of threshold channels",
      "content": "External calcium ([Ca2+]e) and magnesium ([Mg2+]e) concentrations fluctuate across physiological and pathological brain states. For example, [Ca2+]e; decreases during intense neuronal activity and epilepsy, whereas it rises during sleep. Similarly, [Mg2+]e; varies with the sleep/wake cycle and is reduced in epilepsy. Lowering either [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e increases intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the action potential (AP) threshold, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we confirm that reducing [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e enhances intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the AP threshold of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Physiological reductions in [Mg2+]e (0.8 to 0.4 mM) have minimal effect, whereas decreases from supraphysiological levels (2.0 to 0.4 mM) robustly increase excitability. Using pharmacology and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identify the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) as a key mediator of these effects. The calcilytic NPS-2143 mimics and largely occludes both the intrinsic excitability increase and the AP-threshold hyperpolarization, while genetic reduction of CaSR produces similar outcomes. We further show that AP-threshold hyperpolarization induced by low divalent cations involves both Kv1 and Nav1.2 channels. Together, these findings reveal CaSR as a critical link between external divalent cation levels and intrinsic neuronal excitability through the modulation of Kv1 and Nav channels.",

      "title": "The representation of object concepts across the brain",
      "content": "The mechanisms supporting concrete object concepts remain elusive. Here, macaque monkeys spent years learning object-concept primitives defined by color and shape. During fMRI, the monkeys held in mind one concept feature cued by the other. Using a whole-brain searchlight, we observed cross-feature decoding not in retinotopic cortex, but bilaterally in anterior inferior temporal cortex (aIT), temporal pole (TP), and frontal cortex (FC). Only TP and aIT had response patterns to concept shapes matching color-space geometry, and only PF had responses that decode behavioral errors. Two additional imaging experiments showed that color-associated versus non-color-associated shapes, and color-shape combinations congruent versus incongruent with the concepts, were distinguished only by extrastriate visual cortex, suggesting extrastriate cortex underpins color perception and perceptual feature binding. Together, the results provide a blueprint for how the brain generates stable object concepts and provides hypotheses for how conceptual representations engage perceptual representations through selective feedback during vision.",

      "title": "Restoring Amyloid Clearance via Astrocytes: Z17 Is a Selective Inhibitor of CHI3L1 in Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, accumulation of hallmark protein aggregates and substantial neuroinflammation. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) which is predominantly produced by activated astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Overexpression of CHI3L1 has been implicated with AD progression and worsening of symptoms. Herein, we report the identification of Z17 as a novel and selective CHI3L1 inhibitor which directly bind to CHI3L1 an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 6.0 M. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, Z17 acted as a dual-action regulator by reinstating astrocytic function and suppressing inflammation. Additionally, Z17 rescued CHI3L1-induced impairment by dose-dependently restoring A{beta} uptake and normalizing lysosomal proteolytic activity and pH. Furthermore, Z17 effectively blocked CHI3L1-driven activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in human astrocytes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the functional rescue. The in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of Z17 demonstrated favorable drug-like properties for CNS development. These findings support the advancement of Z17 as a selective CHI3L1 inhibitor capable of simultaneously mitigating neuroinflammation and restoring astrocytic clearance mechanisms, making it a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Alzheimers disease.",

      "title": "Age-specific A\u03b2-Tau interactions underlie spatial memory deficits in an APP/PS1 amyloidosis model",
      "content": "Background: Amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau pathology are key molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet how their interaction contributes to cognitive decline remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between Ab burden, tau pathology, presynaptic density, and spatial learning and memory in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic (TG) mouse model of amyloidosis. Methods: Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Barnes maze test in male TG and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, aged 6, 12, and 18 months. Gross visual function was assessed indirectly in 18-month-old animals using the light/dark exploration test. Brains were collected for autoradiography of tau pathology and presynaptic density with [18F]Flortaucipir and [3H]UCB-J, respectively, while Ab plaque load was measured by immunohistochemistry. Correlation and linear mixed-effects regression analyses were used to assess relationships between behavioral and pathological measures. Results: APP/PS1 mice showed normal cognitive performance at 6 months, a selective long-term memory deficit at 12 months, and severe impairments in learning and retention at 18 months, independent of visual confounds. Age-dependent increases in [18F]Flortaucipir binding and Ab plaque load were observed in all brain regions of TG compared to WT mice, whereas [3H]UCB-J binding was increased in a region-dependent manner in 18-month-old TG vs. WT animals. Barnes maze performance during the final day of testing correlated negatively with both Ab and tau pathology across all areas examined. Linear regression revealed a significant association between tau and age and between tau and Ab in the cortex, indicating that memory decline in ageing TG mice was driven by the combined effects of these pathologies. Conclusions: Deficits in memory retention precede impairments in task learning performance in APP/PS1 mice. Spontaneous tau accumulation contributes to the progressive cognitive decline, capturing key aspects of the Ab-tau interaction observed in human AD.",
