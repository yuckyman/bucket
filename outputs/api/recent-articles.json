      "title": "Single-cell map of the female brain across reproductive transitions",
      "content": "Ovarian hormone shifts enable reproduction and are associated with substantial brain plasticity and disease risks. While imaging studies provide (micro)structural insights into brain changes across the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, the high resolution, single-cell map of the brain across reproductive transitions is missing. Here, we performed multiome (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) analysis of the mouse ventral hippocampus (vHIP) across sex, estrous cycle, and peripartum period at single cell resolution. We identify dynamic changes in vHIP cellular composition across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, including in the neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), enabling hormone-driven neurogenesis. Major gene expression changes are neuronal function-relevant, cell type-specific, and found in excitatory neurons of CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, across sex and reproductive transitions. In contrast, chromatin accessibility changes are more extensive and found across cell types, likely driven by estrogen level shifts in both within-female and between-sex comparisons. We show that chromatin remodeling during the estrous cycle primes the genome for gene expression changes during pregnancy and is also enriched for brain disease-relevant genes. Finally, we reveal a thyroid hormone transporter (Transthyretin, Ttr) gene as the major candidate gene that drives structural and behavioral changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Our study provides an extensive cellular and molecular view of how reproductive transitions shape the brain and opens the possibility to target downstream targets of estrogen, including thyroid hormone signaling, as a treatment option for hormone-sensitive periods in women.",

      "title": "Trait anxiety is associated with idiosyncratic neural event boundaries during naturalistic movie-watching",
      "content": "Anxiety is associated with altered patterns of attention to images and objects, but how it influences the perception of continuous experiences remains underexplored. Here, we examined how anxiety influences the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events. Using a large-scale open-access dataset and data-driven methods to detect neural event boundaries, we compared neural event segmentation between healthy adults with high (N=60) and low trait-level anxiety (N=60) as they viewed a short suspenseful film. While the overall temporal event segmentation hierarchy was preserved across groups, higher-anxiety individuals had more idiosyncratic boundaries, exhibiting reduced alignment to both low-anxiety individuals and one another. This divergence was the most pronounced in the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks, suggesting that anxiety-related disruptions in top-down attentional control may contribute to less consistent segmentation. Furthermore, boundary variability in anxious participants was higher during moments rated as more anxiety-provoking by a large language model, controlling for arousal, valence, and low-level visual features. Together, these findings suggest that idiosyncratic event models in anxious individuals result in non-normative organization of continuous experience, leading to more individualized and inconsistent event boundaries. Such variability in segmentation may have downstream consequences for prediction, memory, and social cognition, offering a potential neural mechanism by which anxiety influences the interpretation and recall of everyday experiences. Our findings highlight trait-level variability as a lens through which the brain parses information and offers a neurocomputational framework for investigating individual differences in naturalistic event cognition.",

      "title": "Neural representations of visual memory in inferotemporal cortex reveal a generalizable framework for translating between spikes and field potentials",
      "content": "Translating neurophysiological findings requires understanding the relationship between common measures of brain activity in animals (spiking activity) and humans (local field potentials, LFP). Prior work suggests alignment between population spiking and high-gamma activity (HGA, 50-150 Hz) of the LFP; however, this is not always observed and is consequently debated. Here, we show that this alignment and prior failures depend on the underlying coding scheme. First, we examined neural representations of variables related to visual memory in macaque inferotemporal cortex. We found that spikes and HGA were strikingly aligned for variables encoded as population response magnitude (novelty, recency, and memorability). However, a variable encoded as a distributed pattern of activity (category) was misaligned. Next, we showed that these insights generalize across many published studies, accounting for prior alignment successes and failures. These results provide a framework for translating between spikes and LFPs, highlighting the scenarios likely to be fruitful for translation.",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",
