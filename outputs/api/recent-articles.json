      "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound of the Human Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Reconfigures Resting State Connectivity: A Sham-Controlled fMRI Study",
      "content": "Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) can modulate human brain activity, but its impact on large-scale functional connectivity (FC) in vivo remains incompletely characterized. Here we asked whether brief tFUS to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) modulates its FC with other brain regions. In a sham-controlled, within-subject study of healthy adults (N=16), we measured resting-state blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, during, and after five minutes of tFUS (i.e., five 20-second sonications followed by 40 second pauses). Subject-level sgACC-whole-brain FC was analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model (fixed: time, condition, time x condition; random: subject). tFUS increased sgACC-whole brain connectivity after sonication relative to sham. A smaller, non-significant trend was observed during sonication. Baseline-controlled analyses were employed to rule out the possibility that the observed increase in FC was due to a \"regression to the mean\" effect. Interestingly, network-level analysis revealed a clear disassociation in the evolution of resting-state FC across the 15 minute recordings: during sham sessions, the sgACC's connectivity with the default mode network (DMN) increased, while FC with other networks was largely unchanged. On the other hand, active tFUS led to a notable increase in FC with non-DMN networks (especially the cognitive control network), while connectivity with the DMN was stable. These results provide whole-brain evidence that tFUS reconfigures network dynamics in the human brain, motivating clinical applications to disorders characterized by dysregulated brain activity.",

      "title": "The cyclic nucleotide binding sites of Swiss-Cheese, the Drosophila orthologue of human PNPLA6, are required for its catalytic function",
      "content": "Mutations in Swiss-cheese (SWS) or its vertebrate ortholog PNLPA6, also called Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE), cause progressive neuronal degeneration in Drosophila and mice and several complex syndromes in humans. These include mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, ataxia and blindness and several other symptoms. SWS and PNPLA6 are widely expressed in neurons and in several glial cell types in Drosophila and mice and both cell types require SWS/PNPLA6 function autonomously. SWS and PNPLA6 are structurally and functionally conserved because expression of human or mouse PNPLA6 can replace SWS in flies. These orthologues share several domains, including the highly conserved phospholipase domain that mediates its function in deacetylating phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine. In addition, they share three cyclic nucleotide binding sites and although about 10% of the known disease-causing mutations occur in these sites, their function is still unknown. We therefore generated mutations in these sites in SWS to address what consequences this has for the function of the protein. Mutating only one site (SWSG558E) results in a partially functional protein that rescues the sws knockdown and that decreases PC when overexpressed. However, mutating all three sites (SWS{Delta}CNB) renders SWS non-functional and results in an increase of PC when overexpressed, suggesting that cyclic nucleotide binding can regulate the phospholipase function.",

      "title": "Hierarchical Community Structure of the Adult Drosophila Connectome Reveals Conserved Circuit Archetypes",
      "content": "Biological neural networks can be meaningfully partitioned into sub-networks referred to as communities. Community structure is thought to support functional specialization, adaptability, and cost-efficient wiring. While many studies have focused on inter-regional brain networks, little is known about communities in connectomes mapped at the level of individual neurons and synapses. Here, we analyze the whole-brain Drosophila adult connectome using a nested stochastic block model to uncover its hierarchical community structure. We find that most of the roughly 1500 fine-scale communities--the smallest, and best resolved level of the hierarchy--are spatially compact, generally assortative, and aligned with known biological features such as neurotransmitter identity and cell type. Nonetheless, we find evidence of nonassortative communities, spatially co-localized within the optic lobe and vision-processing pathways. Seeking \"functional primitives\"--small circuits with functionally narrow feature profiles--we use data-driven clustering to group communities into 45 archetypical meta-clusters based on their spatial, functional, and molecular properties, revealing modular building blocks from which larger, functionally diverse communities are composed. This work advances our understanding of how structure and function are organized in the fruit fly brain and highlights the value of statistical network models in interpreting nanoscale connectomes.",
