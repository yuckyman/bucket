      "title": "Perspectives of Global Standards on Validation of Blood Pressure Measuring Devices",
      "content": "Blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are essential tools across all areas of medicine, where BP is used as a vital sign for assessing cardiovascular status, guiding clinical decisions in acute medicine, critical care, and routine monitoring of hospitalized patients. International standards for BP measuring devices establish safety and accuracy criteria to ensure the reliability and usability of these instruments. The standardization of BP device validation protocols is vital to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of readings, which are crucial for effective medical decision-making. However, with the rapid advancements in the field of novel cuffless continuous or intermittent blood pressure monitoring devices, traditional validation standards for cuff-based devices are not applicable to cuffless systems. To address this, various organizations have established specific standards tailored for cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring devices. Nevertheless, only 67 out of over 3,800 studies on the cuffless continuous BP devices (<2%) adopted the appropriate validation criteria, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of their reported results. This work presents a comparative analysis of validation protocols for BP measuring devices and provides guidance on the appropriate standards for different types of BP monitors, aims to highlight areas where standards might be strengthened or harmonized. The findings of this research are intended to contribute to the ongoing efforts to establish globally recognized, scientifically rigorous guidelines for the validation of BP measuring devices, fostering innovation and technological advances in this field over time.",

      "title": "Confidence-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Knee Osteoarthritis",
      "content": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that severely impacts mobility and quality of life, particularly among older adults. Its diagnosis often relies on subjective assessments using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, leading to variability in clinical evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a confidence-driven deep learning framework for early KOA detection, focusing on distinguishing KL-0 and KL-2 stages. The Siamese-based framework integrates a novel multi-level feature extraction architecture with a hybrid loss strategy. Specifically, multi-level Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers are employed to extract features from varying network depths, ensuring comprehensive feature representation, while the hybrid loss strategy partitions training samples into high-, medium-, and low-confidence subsets. Tailored loss functions are applied to improve model robustness and effectively handle uncertainty in annotations. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, comparable to those of expert radiologists. Cohen's kappa values ($\\kappa$ $>$ 0.85)) confirm substantial agreement, while McNemar's test ($p$ $>$ 0.05) indicates no statistically significant differences between the model and radiologists. Additionally, Confidence distribution analysis reveals that the model emulates radiologists' decision-making patterns. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to serve as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enhancing early KOA detection and reducing clinical workload.",

      "title": "Intracortical Brain\u2013Machine Interfaces With High-Performance Neural Decoding Through Efficient Transfer Meta-Learning",
      "content": "Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have emerged as a groundbreaking neural technology for restoring motor function and enabling direct neural communication pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential in neurological rehabilitation, the critical challenge of neural decoder calibration persists, particularly in the context of transfer learning. Traditional calibration approaches assume the availability of extensive neural recordings, which is often impractical in clinical settings due to patient fatigue and neural signal variability. Furthermore, the inherent constraints of implanted neural processors\u2014including limited computational capacity and power consumption requirements\u2014demand streamlined processing algorithms. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we developed DMM-WcycleGAN (Dimensionality Reduction Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning based Wasserstein Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks), a novel neural decoding framework that integrates meta-learning principles with optimal transfer learning strategies. This innovative approach enables efficient decoder calibration using minimal neural data while implementing dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize computational efficiency in implanted devices. In vivo experiments with non-human primates demonstrated DMM-WcycleGAN's superior performance in mitigating neural signal distribution shifts between historical and current recordings, achieving a 3% enhancement in neural decoding accuracy using only ten calibration trials while reducing the calibration duration by over 70%, thus significantly improving the clinical viability of iBMI systems.",

      "title": "An Active Spring Mass Model With Biomimetic Ground Reaction Forces for Multiple Terrains",
      "content": "Common activities of daily living naturally blend walking on level ground, stairs, and slopes. Predicting human locomotion behavior across these environments is critical for control design in lower-limb assistive devices. One approach to achieving this goal is to use feedforward simulation of conceptual gait models that capture the whole body dynamics of human locomotion. So far, however, these models have mainly been developed to predict human walking and running dynamics on level ground. Objective: To develop a conceptual gait model that can walk on level ground as well as negotiate stairs and ramps of different inclinations (up to $\\pm 42^\\circ$) while producing biomimetic ground reaction forces (GRFs). Methods: We extended the passive bipedal spring mass model by incorporating active elements, introducing seven control parameters. These parameters were then tuned to match the human GRFs for stairs. Results: By optimizing these control parameters, we found that the resultant model's GRF correlates strongly with human data with median Pearson correlation coefficients $R_{x}>0.89$ and $R_{y}>0.96$ for stair walking. Furthermore, we observe its predictive capabilities are not limited to stairs, as it can also mimic the GRFs of human slope walking. Finally, we conducted a parameter analysis to assess how model parameters affect GRFs and identified a reduced, five parameter model that can reproduce human GRFs with a fidelity similar to the seven parameter model. Significance: The model may help to predict human locomotion behavior in more complex terrain, for instance, when planning foot placements in the interactive control of powered lower-limb exoskeletons and prostheses.",

      "title": "A Multimodal Ultrasound-Driven Approach for Automated Tumor Assessment With B-Mode and Multi-Frequency Harmonic Motion Images",
      "content": "Objective: Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound elasticity imaging method that measures the mechanical properties of tissue using amplitude-modulated acoustic radiation force (AM-ARF). Multi-frequency HMI (MF-HMI) excites tissue at various AM frequencies simultaneously, allowing for image optimization without prior knowledge of inclusion size and stiffness. However, challenges remain in size estimation as inconsistent boundary effects result in different perceived sizes across AM frequencies. Herein, we developed an automated assessment method for tumor and focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) induced lesions using a transformer-based multi-modality neural network, HMINet, and further automated neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response prediction. HMINet was trained on 380 pairs of MF-HMI and B-mode images of phantoms and in vivo orthotopic breast cancer mice (4T1). Test datasets included phantoms (n = 32), in vivo 4T1 mice (n = 24), breast cancer patients (n = 20), FUS-induced lesions in ex vivo animal tissue and in vivo clinical settings with real-time inference, with average segmentation accuracy (Dice) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. HMINet outperformed state-of-the-art models; we also demonstrated the enhanced robustness of the multi-modality strategy over B-mode-only, both quantitatively through Dice scores and in terms of interpretation using saliency analysis. The contribution of AM frequency based on the number of salient pixels showed that the most significant AM frequencies are 800 and 200 Hz across clinical cases. Significance: We developed an automated, multimodality ultrasound-based tumor and FUS lesion assessment method, which facilitates the clinical translation of stiffness-based breast cancer treatment response prediction and real-time image-guided FUS therapy.",

      "title": "Electrophysiological Correlates of Reinforcement Learning in the Human Ventral Tegmental Area",
      "content": "The ventral tegmental area is the primary source of dopaminergic input to the human prefrontal cortex and plays a central role in reinforcement learning. Although animal studies have established that dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction error signals, direct electrophysiological evidence in humans is scarce. Understanding these mechanisms is clinically relevant because of their involvement in disorders of motivation and reward processing. In this cross-sectional study, we recorded local field potentials from the ventral tegmental area in fourteen patients (nine male; mean age 46 years, range 30-62) undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery for chronic cluster headache. During temporary electrode externalisation, participants performed a probabilistic instrumental learning task comprising reward, loss and neutral trials. Behaviour was modelled using a hierarchical Rescorla-Wagner framework with separate learning rates for rewards and losses. Electrophysiological responses were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping and linear mixed-effects models testing sensitivity to outcome, expected value and reward prediction error. Clear evoked responses were observed for stimulus and outcome events in thirteen subjects. Responses reflecting the contrast between outcomes that delivered a gain, a loss or a neutral signal and those delivering no outcome were significantly larger for gains than for losses or neutral signals (paired t-tests: gain versus loss, t(12)=2.60, p=0.023, Cohen's d=0.72; gain versus neutral, t(12)=4.49, p<0.001, d=1.25), while loss and neutral contrasts did not differ (p=0.218). Nine of fourteen subjects developed a clear preference for the high-reward option; two exhibited gradual learning, while others adopted a win-stay strategy. In eight subjects with clear evoked responses, activity around the button press correlated with the expected value of the chosen option (peak at 0.02s, p=0.013, corrected). In a further subset of two subjects who explored the low-value option, single-trial responses peaked closer to the button press during low-value choices. No compelling evidence was found for a distinct reward prediction error signal beyond outcome and value. Clinical covariates and smoking status did not significantly modulate electrophysiological responses. Human ventral tegmental area activity is selectively tuned to rewarding outcomes and, under conditions of effective learning, reflects the expected value of chosen options during decision-making. These findings align with reinforcement learning principles established in animal models and suggest that local field potentials primarily represent inputs to reward prediction error computation rather than its output. This work provides the first direct electrophysiological evidence of reward-related signalling in the human ventral tegmental area, supporting its translational relevance for understanding motivation and guiding neuromodulatory interventions.",

      "title": "Graph-Based EEG Symmetry Features from the Temporal Lobe as Markers of Antidepressant Treatment Response",
      "content": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that affects millions globally and has highly individualized responses to antidepressant treatment. Identifying objective early markers that can distinguish responders from non-responders remains a critical challenge in personalized psychiatry. In this study, we investigate the role of brain symmetry in EEG-derived functional connectivity as a potential early marker of treatment response. Using resting-state EEG recordings from 176 patients diagnosed with MDD at baseline (Visit~1) and after one week of treatment (Visit~2), we construct graph-based representations of functional connectivity and define region-wise and electrode-wise temporal-lobe symmetry features. We focus on symmetry emph{change scores} (Visit~2$-$Visit~1) across typical EEG frequency bands in both weighted and binary forms. Statistical analyses reveal a consistent group-level pattern in the $alpha$ and $beta$ bands: responders show negative symmetry change scores, whereas non-responders show relative stability or weakly positive change scores. The contrast is strongest in the $beta_1$ band and is more pronounced for binary symmetry metrics, while the $alpha$ band shows the same direction with slightly weaker significance. Physiologically, these opposite trajectories are emph{consistent with} a treatment-related shift toward more lateralized temporal-lobe network organization in responders and a more bilateral coupling pattern in non-responders; however, these neurophysiological interpretations remain hypothesis-generating given the resting-state design and the absence of direct behavioral or task-based validation. To quantify whether temporal symmetry change scores contain reproducible discriminative signal under strict validation, we benchmark the proposed features in a supervised classification pipeline using repeated nested cross-validation. The best-performing configuration achieved a median out-of-sample AUC of 0.690 with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of [0.611, 0.711], indicating modest but reproducible separability. Overall, temporal-lobe symmetry change features provide interpretable candidate markers of early antidepressant-related neurophysiological change that may complement existing EEG predictors in future multi-marker models, but they are not yet sufficient for standalone clinical decision support and require external validation in independent cohorts.",

      "title": "Population decoding of sound source location by receptive field neurons in the mouse superior colliculus",
      "content": "Identifying the location of a sound source in a complex environment and assessing its importance can be crucial for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in sensorimotor functions, contributes to sound localization and contains auditory responsive neurons that have spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs) that are organized into a topographic map along the azimuth. However, individual auditory SC neurons have large spatial RFs, are noisy, and do not respond to the same stimulus at each trial. Therefore, when an animal is presented with a single trial sound, and it needs to rely on a single neuron to locate the sound source direction, the location measurement may be erroneous, missing, or have poor spatial resolution. It is expected that a more reliable and accurate determination of the sound source location will come from a population of neurons. We therefore built a population pattern Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) decoder to build a model that can accurately predict the location of a stimulus given the population response. We compared three models that use either strict firing rate (FR), weighting based on equal (EW) or mutual information (MIW) and show that the MIW model works best, needing only 92 neurons to localize a stimulus with behaviorally relevant precision. Furthermore, by comparing the model fit using the responses from non-RF and RF auditory neurons, we show that only RF neurons contain the information needed to localize a sound source. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the SC uses a population of RF neurons to determine sound source location.",

      "content": "Wide-field optical imaging acquired simultaneously with functional MRI has the ability to provide unprecedented insight into the neural origins of time-varying whole-brain activity. Simultaneously linking cellular-scale activity to whole-brain fMRI remains challenging due to optical access, RF coil placement, and transmission constraints in the MRI environment. We present an integrated platform that combines a long-distance tube lens optical path (>98% transmission), a chronically stable optically-fused cranial window, and a subject-conformal RF surface coil compatible with both EPI and zero-echo-time (ZTE) fMRI. The system supports concurrent wide-field imaging of genetically encoded voltage or calcium indicators concurrently with intrinsic hemoglobin signals. In individual mice, wide-field optical and fMRI measures yield concordant functional connectivity, and cross-modal timing analyses demonstrate that neuronal infraslow dynamics (<0.1 Hz) underlie the majority of fMRI connectivity, after removing hemodynamic crosstalk. The platform's sensitivity, chronic stability, and sequence flexibility broaden access to cellular-to-whole-brain investigations across basic and translational neuroimaging.",

      "content": "Neural decoding is a widely-used machine learning technique for investigating how behavior, perception and cognition are represented in neural activity. However without careful application data leakage can occur, where information from the test set contaminates the training set, leading to biased estimates of decoding performance and potentially invalidating biological conclusions. Here we use simulated and biological datasets to demonstrate how both supervised and unsupervised data preprocessing, including dimensionality reduction, can introduce leakage in neural decoding studies. We reveal that in some cases leakage can paradoxically decrease decoding performance relative to unbiased estimates, and we provide theoretical analyses explaining how this occurs. We demonstrate that, for autocorrelated neural time series, standard k-fold cross-validation can dramatically overstate performance. Finally we provide detailed recommendations for avoiding data leakage in neural decoding.",
