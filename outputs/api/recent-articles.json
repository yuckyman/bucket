      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Hippocampal sequences traverse a memory space",
      "content": "Highly reliable sequential dynamics organize neural activity in the hippocampus and progress with changes in physical, sensory, or cognitive variables, typified by place cells during active exploration. But sensory and behavioral variables are often confounded, and so it remains intensely debated whether hippocampal sequences are driven by sensory content directly or rather reflect the alignment of internally generated dynamics to external perception. Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.",

      "content": "Neural circuits must integrate metabolic information to maintain stable activity and appropriate behavioral responses. While metabolic regulation of excitatory synapses has been well studied, far less is known about how inhibitory synapses respond to changes in energy state. In this study, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a dynamic sensor of cellular nutrient flux, localizes to postsynaptic sites of the inhibitory synapses where it modulates synapse morphology and receptor composition. OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins. Furthermore, OGT deletion accelerated inhibitory postsynaptic current decay kinetics and induced subunit-specific shifts in GABAA receptor surface expression: {beta}3 subunits decreased, whereas {gamma}2 subunit total and surface levels increased. Together, these findings identify OGT as a metabolic regulator that modulates inhibitory synapse structure and signaling, providing a mechanistic link between energy state and GABAergic circuit function in health and disease.",

      "title": "Most early-born subplate neurons persist as Layer 6b neurons in the adult mouse neocortex",
      "content": "Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest-born neurons in the mammalian neocortex and play key roles in radial migration and transient circuit formation. It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.",

      "title": "Neural Sensitivity to Word Frequency Modulated by Morphological Structure: Univariate and Multivariate fMRI Evidence from Korean",
      "content": "A fundamental question in psycholinguistics concerns whether morphological decomposition is obligatory during visual word recognition or whether whole-word access can occur under conditions of high frequency and familiarity. The present study aimed to examine how morphological complexity and lexical frequency jointly influence neural representations during visual word recognition. We addressed this question using rapid event-related fMRI with both univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-five native Korean speakers performed lexical decisions on simple and inflected nouns that varied parametrically in surface frequency (token frequency of the full word form) and base frequency (cumulative stem frequency). Korean's transparent agglutinative morphology enabled a principled dissociation of these frequency measures. MVPA failed to decode morphological condition from activation patterns in any region, suggesting that simple and inflected forms are not represented as discrete neural categories. Crucially, RSA demonstrated robust encoding of surface frequency-but not base frequency-in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), with significantly stronger correlations for inflected than simple nouns. Univariate analyses confirmed this pattern: surface frequency interacted with morphological condition in inferior parietal lobule (IPL), such that higher surface frequency increased activation selectively for inflected forms, while base frequency showed no reliable effects. These results challenge obligatory decomposition and support a distributional framework in which lexical statistics guide the processing of morphologically complex words. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological complexity modulates neural sensitivity to whole-word rather than stem-level statistics, underscoring how structural and statistical factors interact to support morphological processing.",
