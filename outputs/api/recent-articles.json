      "title": "Reflection Before Action: Designing a Framework for Quantifying Thought Patterns for Increased Self-awareness in Personal Decision Making",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.04364v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When making significant life decisions, people increasingly turn to conversational AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs often steer users toward solutions, limiting metacognitive awareness of their own decision-making. In this paper, we shift the focus in decision support from solution-orientation to reflective activity, coining the term pre-decision reflection (PDR). We introduce PROBE, the first framework that assesses pre-decision reflections along two dimensions: breadth (diversity of thought categories) and depth (elaborateness of reasoning). Coder agreement demonstrates PROBE's reliability in capturing how people engage in pre-decision reflection. Our study reveals substantial heterogeneity across participants and shows that people perceived their unassisted reflections as deeper and broader than PROBE's measures. By surfacing hidden thought patterns, PROBE opens opportunities for technologies that foster self-awareness and strengthen people's agency in choosing which thought patterns to rely on in decision-making.",

      "title": "When AI Gets Persuaded, Humans Follow: Inducing the Conformity Effect in Persuasive Dialogue",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.04229v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advancements in AI have highlighted its application in captology, the field of using computers as persuasive technologies. We hypothesized that the \"conformity effect,\" where individuals align with others' actions, also occurs with AI agents. This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a \"Persuadee Agent\" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party persuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue experiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating the Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and the presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude change significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker was also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change. Additionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants increased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results suggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion through the conformity effect.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.04218v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Homonymous hemianopia (HH) patients report difficulties in avoiding collisions with other pedestrians. We evaluated pedestrian collision detection and avoidance behaviors in HH patients and healthy controls using a novel virtual reality (VR) walking with pedestrians, which enables natural walking behavior in an empty real-world corridor while viewing an immersive VR environment (shopping mall with colliding and other pedestrians) presented in a head-mounted display (HMD). Critically, it measures avoidance maneuvers in addition to collision detection. Colliding and non-colliding pedestrian scenarios were developed for Meta Quest 2 using Unity. Ten normal vision (NV) subjects and 12 HH subjects detected and avoided collisions with virtual approaching and overtaken pedestrians initialized at bearing angles of 20, 40, and 60 degrees, with planned time-to-collision of 6 seconds in each trial. HH subjects were less likely to detect and more likely to collide with pedestrians than NV, particularly for blind-side targets. Response times did not differ between groups but were faster for overtaken pedestrians. HH subjects also biased their head rotations toward the blind side and more after detection compared to before. Collision avoidance difficulties as reported by HH subjects, which clinical measures fail to capture, were recorded and analyzed with objective measures. These metrics may offer further insights into the underlying mechanisms driving collision avoidance behaviors. Our HMD-VR collision detection and avoidance paradigm enables natural walking behaviors and offers an affordable, objective assessment tool that may be adopted by clinicians for mobility enhancement and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Wrist2Finger: Sensing Fingertip Force for Force-Aware Hand Interaction with a Ring-Watch Wearable",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.04122v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Hand pose tracking is essential for advancing applications in human-computer interaction. Current approaches, such as vision-based systems and wearable devices, face limitations in portability, usability, and practicality. We present a novel wearable system that reconstructs 3D hand pose and estimates per-finger forces using a minimal ring-watch sensor setup. A ring worn on the finger integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to capture finger motion, while a smartwatch-based single-channel electromyography (EMG) sensor on the wrist detects muscle activations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of motion sensing and muscle signals, our approach achieves accurate hand pose tracking and grip force estimation in a compact wearable form factor. We develop a dual-branch transformer network that fuses IMU and EMG data with cross-modal attention to predict finger joint positions and forces simultaneously. A custom loss function imposes kinematic constraints for smooth force variation and realistic force saturation. Evaluation with 20 participants performing daily object interaction gestures demonstrates an average Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) of 0.57 cm and a fingertip force estimation (RMSE: 0.213, r=0.76). We showcase our system in a real-time Unity application, enabling virtual hand interactions that respond to user-applied forces. This minimal, force-aware tracking system has broad implications for VR/AR, assistive prosthetics, and ergonomic monitoring.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03998v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collaborative group projects are integral to computer science education, as they foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and industry-relevant competencies. However, assessing individual contributions within group settings has long been a challenge. Traditional assessment strategies, such as the equal distribution of grades or subjective peer assessments, often fall short in terms of fairness, objectivity, and scalability, particularly in large classrooms. This paper introduces a semi-automated, AI-assisted grading system that evaluates both project quality and individual effort using repository mining, communication analytics, and machine learning models. The system comprises modules for project evaluation, contribution analysis, and grade computation, integrating seamlessly with platforms like GitHub. A pilot deployment in a senior-level course demonstrated high alignment with instructor assessments, increased student satisfaction, and reduced instructor grading effort. We conclude by discussing implementation considerations, ethical implications, and proposed enhancements to broaden applicability.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03884v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in programming education, focusing on how these tools are being integrated into educational practice and their impact on student learning outcomes. An analysis of fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025 identified three primary categories of AI agents: chatbots, generative AI (GenAI), and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), with GenAI being the most frequently studied. The primary instructional objectives reported include enhanced programming support in 94.83% of studies, motivational and emotional benefits in 18.96%, and increased efficiency for educators in 6.90%. Reported benefits include personalized feedback, improved learning outcomes, and time savings. The review also highlights challenges, such as setup barriers documented in 93.10% of studies, overreliance resulting in superficial learning in 65.52%, and concerns regarding AI errors and academic integrity. These findings suggest the need for instructional frameworks that prioritize the development of prompt engineering skills and human oversight to address these issues. This review provides educators and curriculum designers with an evidence-based foundation for the practical and ethical integration of AI in programming education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03724v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is marked by action imitation deficits stemming from visuomotor integration impairments, posing challenges to imitation-based learning, such as dance movement therapy in mixed reality (MR-DMT). Previous gaze-guiding interventions in ASD have mainly focused on optimizing gaze in isolation, neglecting the crucial \"gaze-performance link\". This study investigates enhancing this link in MR-DMT for children with ASD. Initially, we experimentally confirmed the weak link: longer gaze durations didn't translate to better performance. Then, we proposed and validated a novel dual-level visual guidance system that operates on both perceptual and transformational levels: not only directing attention to task-relevant areas but also explicitly scaffolding the translation from gaze perception to performance execution. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting the gaze-performance link, laying key foundations for more precisely tailored and effective MR-DMT interventions for ASD.",

However, the extent to which this affects human-LLM collaboration in complex problem-solving tasks is not well quantified, especially among novices who are prone to misconceptions. We created two LLM chatbots, one with high sycophancy and one with low sycophancy, and conducted a within-subjects experiment (n=24) in the context of debugging machine learning models to isolate the effect of LLM sycophancy on users' mental models, their workflows, reliance behaviors, and their perceptions of the chatbots. Our findings show that users of the high sycophancy chatbot were less likely to correct their misconceptions and spent more time over-relying on unhelpful LLM responses. Despite these impaired outcomes, a majority of users were unable to detect the presence of excessive sycophancy.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03617v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented and mixed reality (MR) systems have the potential to improve surgical precision by overlaying digital guidance directly onto the operative field. This paper presents a novel MR guidance system using the Magic Leap head-mounted display to assist surgeons in executing precise scalpel movements during liver surgery. The system projects holographic cues onto a patient-specific 3D-printed liver phantom, guiding resection along a predetermined path. We describe the system design, including preoperative modeling, registration of virtual content to the phantom, and real-time visualization through the Magic Leap device. In a controlled phantom study, surgical trainees performed resection tasks with and without MR guidance. Quantitative results demonstrated that MR guidance improved cutting accuracy (mean deviation from planned path was reduced from 5.0 mm without AR to 2.0 mm with AR guidance) and efficiency (mean task time decreased from 55 s to 32 s). These improvements of approximately 60% in accuracy and 40% in speed underscore the potential benefit of MR in surgical navigation. Participants reported that the Magic Leap visualization enhanced depth perception and confidence in locating tumor boundaries. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of an MR-assisted surgical guidance approach, highlighting its feasibility on a realistic organ phantom. We discuss the technical challenges (registration accuracy, line-of-sight, user ergonomics) and outline future steps toward clinical translation. The results suggest that Magic Leap-based MR guidance can significantly augment a surgeon's performance in delicate resection tasks, paving the way for safer and more precise liver surgery.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03526v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: First-time patients undergoing diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans often experience significant anxiety and uncertainty, which can negatively impact scan results and patient well-being. We present an immersive mixed reality (MR) simulator designed to prepare adult patients for their first CT scan, aiming to improve both emotional and physical preparedness. In this paper, we review existing methods for reducing scan-related anxiety -- from educational materials to virtual reality exposure -- and identify their limitations. We then detail the design and technical implementation of our MR simulator, which combines a virtual CT suite walkthrough, guided relaxation training, realistic scan simulation (including audiovisual cues and breath-hold practice), and interactive feedback. The inclusion of these features is grounded in evidence-based rationale drawn from prior studies in patient anxiety reduction and compliance. We report results from a pilot study ($n=50$) demonstrating that patients who used the simulator had significantly lower pre-scan anxiety levels and improved compliance during the actual CT procedure, compared to controls. Patient feedback was overwhelmingly positive, indicating high satisfaction and perceived utility. We discuss the clinical implications of deploying such a tool, challenges in integration, and future directions for improving patient-centered care using mixed reality technologies.",

Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.04110v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.04084v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.",

      "title": "Intrinsic cause-effect power: the tradeoff between differentiation and specification",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.03881v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Integrated information theory (IIT) starts from the existence of consciousness and characterizes its essential properties: every experience is intrinsic, specific, unitary, definite, and structured. IIT then formulates existence and its essential properties operationally in terms of cause-effect power of a substrate of units. Here we address IIT's operational requirements for existence by considering that, to have cause-effect power, to have it intrinsically, and to have it specifically, substrate units in their actual state must both (i) ensure the intrinsic availability of a repertoire of cause-effect states, and (ii) increase the probability of a specific cause-effect state. We showed previously that requirement (ii) can be assessed by the intrinsic difference of a state's probability from maximal differentiation. Here we show that requirement (i) can be assessed by the intrinsic difference from maximal specification. These points and their consequences for integrated information are illustrated using simple systems of micro units. When applied to macro units and systems of macro units such as neural systems, a tradeoff between differentiation and specification is a necessary condition for intrinsic existence, i.e., for consciousness.",

      "title": "Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.03699v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.",

      "title": "Model-Guided Microstimulation Steers Primate Visual Behavior",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.03684v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03306v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.03304v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Memristors have emerged as ideal components for modeling synaptic connections in neural networks due to their ability to emulate synaptic plasticity and memory effects. Discrete models of memristor-coupled neurons are crucial for simplifying computations and efficiently analyzing large-scale neural networks. Furthermore, incorporating fractional-order calculus into discrete models enhances their capacity to capture the memory and hereditary properties inherent in biological neurons, thus reducing numerical discretization errors compared to integer-order models. Despite this potential, discrete fractional-order neural models coupled through memristors have received limited attention. To address this gap, we introduce two novel discrete fractional-order neural systems. The first system consists of two Rulkov neurons coupled via dual memristors to emulate synaptic functions. The second system expands this configuration into a ring-shaped network of neurons consisting of multiple similar subnetworks. We present a novel theorem that defines stability regions for discrete fractional-order systems, applicable to both proposed models. Integrating discrete fractional-order calculus into memristor-coupled neural models provides a foundation for more accurate and efficient simulations of neural dynamics. This work advances the understanding of neural network stability and paves the way for future research into efficient neural computations.",

      "content": "Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (PDC) is one phenotype of a disappearing neurodegenerative disease (Guam ALS-PDC) that shows clinical and neuropathological relationships with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), atypical parkinsonism and Alzheimer disease. ALS-PDC has been linked with exposure to environmental factors (notably cycad plant neurotoxins), but evidence from human and animal studies is inconclusive. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a powerful in vitro system to explore the underlying cause of PDC. iPSC lines were derived from lymphocytes of a PDC-affected Guamanian Chamorro female patient and an age- and gender-matched healthy Chamorro resident of PDC-unaffected Saipan using non-integrating episomal plasmids. iPSCs derived from both patients expressed pluripotency markers (Oct4, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, Sox2) prior to the generation of neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs), neurons and astrocytes. An embryoid body protocol was used to derive hNPCs from both iPSC lines while a differentiation media was used to generate neurons from hNPCs. hNPCs derived from both iPSC lines displayed established neuroprogenitor markers (nestin, Sox2), while the differentiated hNPCs exhibited both neuronal (beta-tubulin III, Map2, doublecortin) and synaptic (synaptophysin, PSD-95) markers. Expression of these protein markers in hNPCs and neurons by dot blotting was also observed for both lines. Astrocyte progenitor cells and mature astrocytes with appropriate markers were also developed from the hNPCs of both lines using commercial kits. Development of these patient-derived iPSCs provides a human model for evaluating the role of environmental (e.g., cycad toxins) and genetic factors in ALS-PDC and possibly other related neurodegenerative diseases.",
