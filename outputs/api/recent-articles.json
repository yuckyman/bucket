      "title": "mmWave Radar for Sit-to-Stand Analysis: A Comparative Study With Wearables and Kinect",
      "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

      "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
      "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

      "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
      "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Memory dysfunction and psychiatric outcomes in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are linked to altered structural brain complexity",
      "content": "Introduction: Most patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) experience long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae despite immunotherapy. However, how these residual symptoms relate to structural brain changes in the post-acute phase remains unclear. Recently, fractal dimensionality (FD) has emerged as a sensitive imaging marker of structural brain complexity in related conditions but has not been explored in autoimmune encephalitis. Methods: This cross-sectional study combined clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging analyses in 70 patients with post-acute NMDARE (median time from onset: 22 months), and 70 healthy controls matched for age (t=-0.57, p=0.57) and sex ({chi}2=0, p=1). High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed with FreeSurfer and computational fractal analysis. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). Psychiatric manifestations underwent phenotypical analyses, and memory performance was assessed with standardized neuropsychological tests. Results: Patients with NMDARE were severely affected at peak illness but showed substantial overall improvement in the post-acute stage (median mRS at peak=5, post-acute=1, z=-7.2, p<0.001; median CASE at peak=11, post-acute=1, z=-7.2, p<0.001). However, 67% of patients showed residual CASE symptoms, with memory dysfunction (61%) and psychiatric symptoms (36%) representing the most prevalent domains. Therein, psychiatric symptoms showed a phenotypical shift from a 'schizophrenia-like' phenotype at peak illness to an affective phenotype in the post-acute stage. Neuroimaging uncovered a characteristic pattern of reduced structural brain complexity, including the hippocampus bilaterally and a fronto-cingulo-temporal cluster in cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter. Importantly, normative modeling revealed that patients with residual symptoms showed stronger alterations of brain complexity than those without (psychiatric: t=-2.65, p=0.010; memory: t=-3.98, p<0.001; both vs. no symptoms: t=-5.46, p<0.001). Similarly, patients with stronger alterations of brain complexity showed lower scores of visuospatial and verbal memory (all pFDR<0.015). Discussion: Post-acute NMDARE is characterized by systematic reductions in structural brain complexity, consistently involving previously implicated regions while identifying changes in the cingulate cortex as a new morphological correlate. These changes are linked to residual psychiatric symptoms and memory dysfunction, highlighting FD as a promising new imaging marker of long-term outcomes. Our findings suggest that current treatment strategies may be insufficient to fully address the residual symptom burden after the acute phase of NMDARE.",

      "title": "Evaluating the quality of brainstem ROI registration using structural and diffusion MRI",
      "content": "Accurate registration of regions of interest (ROIs) from standard atlases to participants' native spaces is a critical step in fMRI studies, as it directly affects the reliability of sampled BOLD signals. While T1-weighted (T1w) image-based ROI registration is well validated and widely adopted in cortical fMRI, its performance degrades in brainstem studies due to the small size, dense packing, and poor visibility of brainstem nuclei on T1w contrast. We hypothesized that incorporating diffusion MR images, containing more information about internal brainstem architecture, should improve ROI registration accuracy. To test this, we developed four registration pipelines that either included or excluded diffusion-based alignment components and evaluated their performance using data from n=10 healthy participants. Registration accuracy was assessed using Dice coefficients for the red nucleus (RN) and mis-registration fractions for the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The results showed that diffusion-based pipelines, using fractional anisotropy (FA) images, non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, and multivariate combination, outperformed the T1w-only baseline. Probabilistic maps derived from inverse-transformed native ROIs further supported improved sensitivity to inter-individual anatomical variability in the diffusion-augmented pipelines. In addition, analysis of gradient magnitude maps from the Jacobian determinants revealed associations between localized deformation and image modality-specific landmarks. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-augmented pipelines for improving brainstem ROI registration, which could enhance the robustness of fMRI studies on brainstem disorders characterized by functional dysregulation.",

      "title": "VMAT2 dysfunction impairs vesicular dopamine uptake, driving its oxidation and \u03b1-synuclein pathology in DJ-1-linked Parkinson's disease neurons",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by -synuclein accumulation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, with dopamine (DA) oxidation emerging as a key pathological driver. However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered iPSC midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and -synuclein accumulation. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased VMAT2 protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on ATP, which is notably reduced in DJ-1-deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",

      "title": "Growth inhibitory effect of cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients on HFF2 cells",
      "content": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Occurrence of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in this disease and expression of ICD markers in the CSF of MS patients are documented. However, cytotoxic effect of MS patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the cells is not reported. To evaluate the cytotoxic impact of CSF from MS patients on cell viability, human foreskin fibroblast (HFF2) cells were treated with CSF samples from individuals with MS and healthy controls. The results inferred that patient-derived CSF significantly declined the survival of HFF2 cells in comparison to the CSF of healthy individuals. This observation implies a cytotoxic environment and characteristic of patients CSF, which could be due to the presence of cellular-damaging factors such as calreticulin (CRT) in the patients CSF. The cytotoxic environment of CSF might reflect ICD occurrence in CNS of the patients and also could explain the progressive essence of the disease.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",
