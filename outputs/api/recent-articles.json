Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Hyperscanning has allowed neuroscience to expand investigations into neuronal activation during social interactions. Rather than analyzing how a single brain responds, we can compare interactions and even synchronization between multiple actors in varying situations. This technique is commonly employed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Specifically, social cooperation and competition have been thoroughly investigated using this approach. While functional magnetic resonance...",

In this context, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for measuring brain activity in a natural, unconstrained environment. While interpersonal synchrony using fNIRS hyperscanning has been well-studied using statistical association analysis, establishing causal relationships...",
