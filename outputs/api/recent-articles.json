      "title": "Loss of contractile pericytes and their impaired calcium dynamics exacerbate brain ischemic stroke of awake mice in acute and chronic phases",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke frequently results in persistent neurovascular uncoupling, whereby neuronal activity fails to evoke appropriate microvascular responses despite restoration of upstream blood flow. The cellular mechanisms governing this dysfunction along the arteriolar-capillary continuum remain poorly understood. Using two-photon microscopy and laser speckle imaging in awake Acta2-GCaMP8 mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we examined calcium signaling and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells, precapillary sphincters (PS), and contractile pericytes during stroke progression. During acute phase, PSs exhibited pronounced calcium elevations and strong constriction, amplifying downstream capillary constriction through spatially localized calcium signaling. Following reperfusion, excessive calcium elevations persisted without proportional diameter changes, indicating calcium signaling dysregulation and early uncoupling between mural cell calcium dynamics and vascular responses. In the chronic phase, ischemia induced PS-associated loss of contractile pericytes, leading to capillary dilation and sustained impairment of neurovascular coupling. Although pericyte coverage and calcium signaling partially recovered from second week post stroke, whisker-evoked vascular responses and calcium sensitivity remained compromised. At the network level, blood flow responses became spatially heterogeneous, with pericyte-lost regions exhibiting prolonged hyporesponsiveness during functional hyperemia. These findings identify PSs as key regulators of ischemia-induced microvascular dysfunction and highlight mural cell calcium dysregulation and pericyte loss as drivers of persistent neurovascular uncoupling after stroke.",

      "title": "ANKS1B in the Nucleus Accumbens controls escalated cocaine self-administration via regulating CBP-FoxO3 complex",
      "content": "The transition from controlled to escalated drug intake is a core feature of cocaine use disorder (CUD), yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavioral escalation remain poorly defined. Our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified ANKS1B as a significant shared genetic risk factor for heroin, methamphetamine, and alcohol dependence, suggesting a broad role in addiction vulnerability. However, the specific function of ANKS1B in cocaine addiction and its associated neural mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that ANKS1B expression level in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) was downregulated after extended cocaine use, and manipulating ANKS1B could selectively influence the escalation of cocaine intake and the subsequent cocaine-seeking behavior in the long-access cocaine self-administration rat model. Molecular experiments reveal that ANKS1B interacts with the histone acetyltransferase CBP to control H3K27 acetylation and extended cocaine intake, via epigenetically repressing the transcription factor FoxO3. Overall, these findings suggest that ANKS1B is a crucial factor influencing the escalation of cocaine use. The ANKS1B-CBP-FoxO3 signaling pathway presents a promising target for potential therapeutic interventions for controlling extended cocaine use.",

      "title": "A Quantitative Benchmark of Visual Information in Human Brain Recordings Across fMRI, MEG, and EEG",
      "content": "Noninvasive human brain recordings such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG are widely used to study visual representations, yet their relative information content has never been quantitatively benchmarked under matched experimental conditions. Here, we develop a unified decoding framework that enables fair cross-modal comparison using identical naturalistic stimuli (THINGS) and a common decoding analysis. Using a matched stimulus set, we first quantify modality performance via object-category decoding accuracy. Under these conditions, fMRI yielded the highest accuracy (mean 87%), MEG showed intermediate performance (mean 35%), and single-subject EEG achieved lower accuracy (mean 7%), while remaining reliably above chance level (1%). Notably, EEG performance improved substantially when decoding outputs were aggregated across participants in the form of a stimulus-level relational structure, yielding a group-level EEG measure (28%) with accuracy comparable to MEG. We then examined how decoding performance scales with the number of training stimuli and effective measurement time. These analyses revealed distinct efficiency-precision trade-offs across modalities: MEG and group-level EEG were most efficient for short measurement times, whereas fMRI achieved the highest asymptotic performance when sufficient data were collected. Together, these findings demonstrate that modality performance differs systematically even under tightly matched conditions and that decoding provides a principled way to assess the information content of fMRI, MEG, and EEG. The proposed unified framework offers practical guidelines for modality selection, experimental design, and data collection planning in neuroscience.",

Deploy a DaemonSet from a random GitHub user to ping stale ARP entries every 10 seconds. The upstream Cilium fix is merged but not yet deployed to DOKS. No ETA.<p>I chose managed services specifically to avoid ops emergencies. We're a tiny startup paying the premium so someone else handles this. Instead, I spent late night hours debugging VPC routing issues in a networking layer I don't control.<p>HN's usual advice is \"just use managed services, focus on the business.\" Generally good advice. But managed doesn't mean worry-free, it means trading your failure modes for the vendor's failure modes. You're not choosing between problems and no problems. You're choosing between problems you control and (fewer?) problems you don't.<p>Still using DO. Still using managed services.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Thrilled to be launching <a href=\"https://github.com/katanemo/plano\">Plano</a> (0.4+)- an edge and service proxy (aka data plane) with orchestration for agentic apps. Plano offloads the rote plumbing work like orchestration, routing, observability and guardrails not central to any codebase but tightly coupled today in the application layer thanks to the many hundreds of AI frameworks out there.</p> <p>Runs alongside your app servers (cloud, on-prem, or local dev) deployed as a side-car, and leaves GPUs where your models are hosted.</p> <p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>AI practitioners will probably tell you that calling an LLM is not the hard. The really hard part is delivering agentic apps to production quickly and reliably, then iterating without rewriting system code every time. In practice, teams keep rebuilding the same concerns that sit outside any single agent\u2019s core logic:</p> <p>This includes model choice - the ability to pull from a large set of LLMs and swap providers without refactoring prompts or streaming handlers. Developers need to learn from production by collecting signals and traces that tell them what to fix. They also need consistent policy enforcement for moderation and jailbreak protection, rather than sprinkling hooks across codebases. And they need multi-agent patterns to improve performance and latency without turning their app into orchestration glue.</p> <p>These concerns get rebuilt and maintained inside fast-changing frameworks and application code, coupling product logic to infrastructure decisions. It\u2019s brittle, and pulls teams away from core product work into plumbing they shouldn\u2019t have to own.</p> <p><strong>What Plano does</strong></p> <p>Plano moves core delivery concerns out of process into a modular proxy and dataplane designed for agents. It supports inbound listeners (agent orchestration, safety and moderation hooks), outbound listeners (hosted or API-based LLM routing), or both together. Plano provides the following capabilities via a unified dataplane:</p> <p>- Orchestration: Low-latency routing and handoff between agents. Add or change agents without modifying app code, and evolve strategies centrally instead of duplicating logic across services.</p> <p>- Guardrails &amp; Memory Hooks: Apply jailbreak protection, content policies, and context workflows (rewriting, retrieval, redaction) once via filter chains. This centralizes governance and ensures consistent behavior across your stack.</p> <p>- Model Agility: Route by model name, semantic alias, or preference-based policies. Swap or add models without refactoring prompts, tool calls, or streaming handlers.</p> <p>- Agentic Signals\u2122: Zero-code capture of behavior signals, traces, and metrics across every agent, surfacing traces, token usage, and learning signals in one place.</p> <p>The goal is to keep application code focused on product logic while Plano owns delivery mechanics.</p> <p><strong>On Architecture</strong></p> <p>Plano has two main parts:</p> <p>Envoy-based data plane. Uses Envoy\u2019s HTTP connection management to talk to model APIs, services, and tool backends. We didn\u2019t build a separate model server\u2014Envoy already handles streaming, retries, timeouts, and connection pooling. Some of us were core Envoy contributors.</p> <p>Brightstaff, a lightweight controller and state machine written in Rust. It inspects prompts and conversation state, decides which agents to call and in what order, and coordinates routing and fallback. It uses small LLMs (1\u20134B parameters) trained for constrained routing and orchestration. These models do not generate responses and fall back to static policies on failure.

      "content": "Motor and episodic memories are classically conceptualised as distinct memory domains. However, both memory sequences are characterised by order and timing of their elements. Generalisation has been previously documented between these different memories, with a shared ordinal structure facilitating learning. However, it is unclear whether this generalisation also applies to the timing structure of a sequence. In a between-subject design, healthy adults (N = 143) learned and reproduced motor and episodic memory sequences with either the same or different timing structures. Contrary to expectations, recall of an episodic timeline was poorer when preceded by learning a motor sequence with the same timing structure. Motor sequence reproduction was not affected by prior episodic encoding. The findings do not support the hypothesis of cross-domain generalisation of timing structure between episodic and motor memories. However, the observed interference may suggest some overlap in the mechanism encoding timing information between memory systems.",

      "title": "Whole-genome profiling of native 5-hydroxymethylation in human neurons with long-read sequencing",
      "content": "The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification of DNA is particularly prevalent in neurons and thereby a hallmark of the brain's epigenetic landscape. While 5mC DNA methylation is a well-known player in genome stability and transcriptional regulation, the role of 5hmC remains largely unknown. Here, we used long-read Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to profile whole-genome, native 5mC and 5hmC levels in sorted neuronal nuclei samples from human post-mortem brain tissue. We applied different models for DNA modification calling and compared with array-based 5mC and 5hmC levels derived from the same samples, demonstrating high sample-wise correlations. Annotation across genomic and regulatory features, as well as chromatin states, generated by the International Human Epigenome Consortium, revealed high levels of 5hmC in introns, actively transcribed genes and (distal) enhancers. Pathway analysis of genes with high levels of 5hmC (> 60%) were enriched in neuron-related terms, with functional variety when stratifying across chromatin states. Analysis of transcription factor motifs in highly methylated regions, demonstrated 5hmC- and 5mC-specific enrichment affecting downstream regulatory networks. Altogether, our study demonstrates the potential of ONT to characterize whole-genome, native 5hmC and 5mC DNA modifications in human neurons, specifically highlighting the enrichment of 5hmC in actively transcribed regions and enhancers in the human brain.",

      "title": "fMRI-Based Prediction of Eye Gaze During Naturalistic Movie Viewing Reveals Eye-Movement-Related Brain Activity",
      "content": "Eye gaze and eye movements provide important indices of perceptual and cognitive processes, particularly under naturalistic conditions such as movie viewing. However, concurrent eye tracking is often unavailable in functional MRI (fMRI) studies due to technical and logistical constraints. Recent deep learning approaches have made it possible to estimate eye gaze directly from eyeball signals in fMRI data, offering a potential alternative to camera-based eye tracking. Here, we applied a pre-trained fMRI-based deep neural network model (DeepMReye) to estimate eye gaze during movie watching across three independent fMRI datasets. Model performance was evaluated by comparison with camera-based eye-tracking data when available, as well as by assessing inter-individual correlations, a commonly used benchmark in naturalistic fMRI research. At the individual level, predicted gaze showed modest correspondence with measured data (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.67). In contrast, group-averaged gaze predictions exhibited substantially higher correlations (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.8), indicating improved reliability at the group level. We further derived eye-movement-related time series from the predicted gaze signals and examined their associated brain activity. Consistent with differences in prediction accuracy, individual-level analyses yielded activation patterns largely restricted to visual cortex, whereas group-averaged predictions revealed more widespread activation, including established oculomotor control regions such as frontal and parietal eye fields. Exploratory analyses indicated age-related effects on gaze prediction accuracy and eye-movement-related brain activity, although these effects were not consistent across datasets. Together, these findings demonstrate that group-averaged fMRI-based gaze estimation can support the investigation of eye-movement-related brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, while highlighting current limitations for individual-level inference. The results provide a methodological assessment of fMRI-based gaze prediction and inform its appropriate use in future neuroimaging studies.",
