      "title": "KIF5A binds RNA to orchestrate synaptic mRNA localization and stress granules in ALS",
      "content": "Neuronal health depends on the precise transport and local translation of mRNAs to maintain synaptic function across highly polarized cellular architecture. While kinesin motor proteins are known to mediate mRNA transport, the specificity and direct involvement of individual kinesins as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that KIF5A, a neuron-specific kinesin implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), functions as an RBP. We show that KIF5A directly binds mRNAs encoding synaptic ribosomal proteins and is required for their synaptic localization and for maintaining normal synaptic composition and function. Additionally, we show ALS-linked KIF5A mutations confer gain-of-function properties, enhancing mRNA binding, increasing synaptic ribosomal protein accumulation, inducing neuronal hyperexcitability, and impairing stress responses. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant KIF5A disrupts synaptic homeostasis. Our work positions a kinesin motor protein as an RBP with critical roles in mRNA transport, local translation, and stress response.",

      "title": "Striatal Pathways for Action Counting and Steering",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for coordinating voluntary movements, yet their precise contribution remains a subject of debate. Using a novel operant counting task, we trained mice to perform a specific number of lever presses to obtain a reward, enabling quantification of continuous kinematics, discrete actions, and action sequences. Optogenetic manipulations of direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) striatal projection neurons exert bidirectional and dissociable influences on both movement steering and action count progression: activation of dSPNs extends press sequences as if resetting an internal accumulator, whereas activation of iSPNs prematurely terminates them, mimicking completion of the count. In vivo calcium imaging reveals distinct yet intermixed populations of dSPNs and iSPNs representing either lever approach or count progression, with ramping activity patterns consistent with accumulation and discharge dynamics. Importantly, the difference between dSPN and iSPN population activity scales with proximity to both spatial and count-based goals, unifying discrete and continuous control within a push/pull model. These findings establish the BG as a central circuit for integrating kinematic and sequential representations to monitor and steer progress toward behavioral goals.",

      "title": "Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 2/3 Circuits for Prediction Error Computation through Compartmentalized Spiking Neurons",
      "content": "Cortical Layer 2/3 has been consistently implicated as the locus of prediction-error signalling in hierarchical models of cortical sensory processing. However, the circuit mechanisms that generate biologically plausible prediction-error (PE) signals remain elusive. A spiking network model is presented here in which two-compartment excitatory pyramidal neurons interact with three inhibitory subtypes: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons,to compute sign-specific prediction errors (positive and negative PEs). Feedforward input targets the soma, whereas top-down feedback reaches the distal apical dendrite, enabling a local somato-dendritic comparison. A PE emerges whenever the balance between excitation and inhibition is selectively disrupted within one compartment, recruiting either positive-error (PE+) or negative-error (PE-) subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. Unlike prior learning-dependent, rate-based accounts, this fixed-weight spiking circuit shows that bidirectional PE signals (PE+ and PE) can arise online from compartment-specific balance without any synaptic weight updates. The model reproduces key experimental observations, including sparse mismatch responses, compartment-specific inhibition, and VIP-mediated disinhibition. Across four canonical sensory-prediction configurations, the circuit maintains a tight balance during matched input and generates bidirectional PE signals only under mismatch. By routing sensory drive from Layer 4 into Layer 2/3 and allowing the resulting PE activity to project toward deeper feedback generators, the model situates Layer 2/3 as a dedicated, feature-specific mismatch detector within a hierarchical inference network. These results provide a mechanistic bridge from dendritic computation to laminar predictive coding, demonstrating how realistic spiking dynamics can implement fast, sign-specific PE signaling without learning.",

      "title": "Structural changes in autism reflect atypical brain network organization and phenotypical heterogeneity: a hybrid deep network approach",
      "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by heterogeneity in social and emotional responses, language, and behavior. Assessments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) can quantify this variability but understanding underlying mechanisms and identifying distinct and shared atypical organization and function of brain networks remains a challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyze imaging data. However, the relationship between structural brain changes observed in structural MRI (sMRI), the affected brain functional networks inferred from these structural changes, and their connection to ASD phenotypes and scores still requires systematic investigation. In this study, we ensembled 3D CNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis of macrostructural changes in ASD. We found consistently dominant involvement of (a) the left hemisphere, (b) the frontal and temporal lobe, and (c) the default mode, salience, and language networks in ASD. Our findings highlighted brain network similarities and differences between high and low severity ASD and showed that typically developed brains fall at the low-severity end of the high-to-low severity spectrum of ASD. Our systematic AI approach utilized the phenotypic heterogeneity and spectral nature of ASD to uncover significant structural changes across brain regions and functional networks, correlating the structural, functional, and phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with ASD. This enabled us to identify known and novel global and local brain region and network changes in ASD in relation to phenotypes and clinical scores that can guide diagnostic subtyping.",

      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "Spec2VolCAMU-Net: a spectrogram-to-volume model for EEG-to-fMRI reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net",
      "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Main results. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
