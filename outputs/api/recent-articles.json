      "title": "Perceiving less or perceiving unreliably? Disentangling thermosensory sensitivity and precision in the contexts of ageing and neuropathy",
      "content": "Thermal perception is determined not only by sensitivity but also by precision, yet the latter is often overlooked in thermosensation and pain research. This study examined how ageing and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) affect the sensitivity and precision of thermal perception and whether combining these parameters can aid in distinguishing patients from healthy controls. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we estimated psychometric function thresholds (sensitivity) and slopes (precision) for cold detection, warm detection, cold pain, and heat pain in 86 healthy adults (aged 21-80) and 34 patients with DPN. We assessed age- and neuropathy-related effects on these parameters. Using simulated classification analyses, we also tested their utility in discriminating patients from controls. Ageing was associated with elevated detection and cold pain thresholds and reduced precision of cold detection. Patients with DPN showed similar patterns: higher detection thresholds and lower cold detection slopes while pain-related parameters were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that ageing and neuropathy produce qualitatively similar changes in thermosensory function, particularly affecting cold detection sensitivity and precision. Classification based on detection thresholds and cold detection slope successfully discriminated patients from controls, with cold detection slope offering the best performance. Combining threshold and slope parameters did not significantly improve classification accuracy. Accurate classification was not possible based on pain thresholds and slopes. Modelling both thresholds and slopes provides a more comprehensive view of sensory decline and may enhance the detection of early or subtle sensory dysfunction.",

      "title": "Neuronal detection of social actions directs collective escape behavior",
      "content": "Animals in groups obtain information from their social partners to engage in collective behavior. Social information transmission has been observed amongst individuals in fish schools, bird flocks, and human groups, but the neural mechanisms for detecting socially transmitted information are poorly understood. By studying the schooling glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we demonstrate that escape from danger is enhanced by visual perception of other escaping fish. We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range. These results show how neural computations in individuals enables rapid information sharing in animal collectives.",

      "title": "Cortex-Wide Substrates for Body Schema and Action Awareness",
      "content": "The body schema, an internal model of the body's configuration in space, is essential for embodied perception and voluntary action. Cortical lesions can disrupt the body schema; however, it remains unclear how the cortex efficiently represents the vast repertoire of body postures during natural behavior. Here, we unveil the representational format underlying the body schema by combining large-scale electrophysiology with 3D full-body motion capture in freely moving mice. Across posterior parietal (PPC) and sensorimotor cortices (SMC), neurons encoded diverse postural features in distinct reference frames: PPC neurons emphasize midline-referenced features related to left-right turning, whereas SMC neurons encode body elevation and pitch relative to the ground, revealing a gravicentric reference frame. Strikingly, beyond static posture encoding, we identified neural ensembles selectively activated during stereotyped actions such as walking, rearing, and grooming. These action ensembles fire in phase-locked sequences that tile the entire action cycle, providing a substrate for action awareness. A network model recapitulated these dynamics, showing that population activity clustered into action-specific subspaces. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cortex organizes the body schema around actions, compressing high-dimensional kinematics into an efficient, gravity-anchored, and action-aware neural code.",

      "title": "Identifying Traumatic Brain Injuries Using a Morlet Wavelet fNIRS Analysis in Role of Care 1 and 2 Environments: A Feasibility Study",
      "content": "CONCLUSION: The Morlet wavelet fNIRS analysis identified the injured region of the brain at initial, RTA, and RTP timepoints in ROC 1 and 2 environments. It did not detect differences in recovery, but there was an improvement in simple reaction time. Thus, the fNIRS analysis detected TBI's in ROC 1 and 2, but further development is needed to increase its sensitivity to tracking TBI's over time.",

      "content": "(1) Background: Virtual Reality (VR) films challenge traditional visual cognition by offering novel perceptual experiences. This study investigates the applicability of Gestalt grouping principles in dynamic VR scenes, the influence of VR environments on grouping efficiency, and the relationship between viewer experience and grouping effects. (2) Methods: Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 42 participants using the HTC Vive Pro Eye and Tobii Pro Lab. Participants watched a...",
