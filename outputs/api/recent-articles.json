      "title": "TDP-43 loss of function drives aberrant splicing in Parkinson's disease",
      "content": "While mRNA splicing dysregulation is a well-established contributor to neurodegeneration in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains underexplored. Here, we analyse transcriptomic data from >500 post-mortem human brain samples from individuals with and without PD to show that splicing alterations are frequently detected. Differentially spliced genes were significantly more enriched for those causally-implicated in both PD and ALS than genes that were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between these splicing alterations and dysfunction of the RNA-binding protein (RBP), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Strikingly, genes and exon junctions affected by TDP-43 knockdown overlapped significantly with those dysregulated across brain regions in PD. In brains from individuals with the LRRK2 c.6055G>A (p.G2019S) mutation, the most common genetic cause of PD, we also observed significant enrichment of TDP-43-dependent splicing changes. This finding was corroborated in human pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a LRRK2 p.G2019S knock-in mouse model, where reduced nuclear TDP-43 levels evidenced the well-recognised loss-of-function mechanism contributing to splicing dysregulation. By leveraging our RNA-based analyses we predicted TDP-43-dependent novel peptide sequences and validated their existence within human LRRK2 mutation mDNs, while also demonstrating an overall loss of protein and mRNA expression in mis-spliced genes. Collectively, our findings reveal that PD is marked by extensive splicing dysregulation dependent on TDP-43, making TDP-43 a promising new therapeutic target in PD.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",
