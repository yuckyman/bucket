      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "content": "BackgroundChronic pain significantly impacts the physical, emotional, and social wellbeing of individuals. Despite advances in treatments, chronic pain prevalence continues to rise, emphasizing the need for comprehensive therapeutic approaches.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a one-month Pain Oriented Biobehavioral Therapeutic Education (POBTE) program on clinical outcomes for chronic primary musculoskeletal pain.MethodsIn a single-blind feasibility pilot of a randomized controlled trial, 16 participants were assigned to an intervention group receiving POBTE education and exercise (n\u202f=\u202f8) or a control group (n\u202f=\u202f8) participating in exercise only. Primary outcomes were pain intensity, measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) plasma levels.ResultsThe intervention group showed a significant increase in BDNF levels from a mean of 2.174 at baseline to 3.063 at the end of treatment (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, r\u202f=\u202f0.63), with a non-significant reduction in pain intensity. Secondary outcomes, including anxiety, sleep quality, and physical activity, improved significantly. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size.ConclusionThe POBTE program appears feasible and acceptable, showing preliminary signals consistent with potential improvements in several clinical variables related to chronic pain management. These exploratory findings support the need for larger-scale, adequately powered trials.",

      "content": "Long-term exposure to high-altitude hypobaric hypoxia has a detrimental effect on cognitive function. These effects are dependent on multiple factors, including altitude, exposure duration, pre-acclimatization conditions, psychological traits, and individual differences. Existing studies have investigated pathogenesis, epidemiology, and interventions for hypobaric hypoxia-associated cognitive impairment based on population studies and preclinical models. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involve energy metabolism, neuronal autophagy, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, gut microbiota imbalances, and genetic susceptibility. However, no consensus has been reached on the most important mechanisms and most recommended animal models, and no standard effective interventions are currently available. This review aims to provide new insights and research perspectives for cognitive impairment following high-altitude exposure. By systematically summarizing the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypobaric hypoxia-associated cognitive impairment, we comprehensively compare animal models for studying high-altitude-induced cognitive decline using three paradigms, i.e., mild, moderate, and extreme high-altitude exposure. Additionally, we introduce various in vitro models, including pluripotent stem cells and brain organoids, which can be used to evaluate the potential mechanisms and therapies. Furthermore, we analyze the challenges in current studies and propose key research directions for future work.",

      "content": "BackgroundGastrointestinal disorders are common in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, but the impact of occult gastrointestinal bleeding (occult GIB) and its link to gut dysbiosis remain underexplored. Occult GIB, often undetected due to subtle symptoms, may significantly affect stroke recovery and long-term outcomes.MethodWe conducted a prospective, multi-center cohort study involving 482 AIS patients. Fecal samples collected within 48\u202fh of admission were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were followed for 1\u202fyear to assess major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including death and recurrent stroke.ResultsOccult GIB was identified in 13.9% of patients, who had significantly higher rates of 90-day dependency (56.7% vs. 20.5%) and 1-year MACEs (28.6% vs. 15.5%) compared to non-GIB patients. These patients also exhibited higher infection rates and enrichment of specific gut pathogens, including Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated levels of these pathogens were independent risk factors for occult GIB. Furthermore, occult GIB independently predicted 90-day dependency (aOR 2.478, 95% CI [1.159\u20135.296]) and 1-year MACEs (aOR 1.905, 95% CI [1.003\u20133.617]).ConclusionOccult GIB is prevalent in AIS patients and is associated with worse long-term outcomes, particularly in those with enrichment of these specific gut pathogens. Early detection and management of occult GIB may improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating underlying mechanisms and developing targeted interventions.",

      "title": "Exercise as a modulator of gut microbiota for improvement of sleep quality: a narrative review",
      "content": "Sleep quality is a cornerstone of physical and mental well-being, yet millions of individuals worldwide suffer from chronic sleep disturbances. Recent developments in microbiome research have shown that the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis regulates sleep by two-way communication between the gut and brain. Exercise is well-documented for its beneficial impact on sleep, yet emerging evidence indicates that one mechanism by which it achieves this may involve the modulation of gut microbiota. This narrative review examines the developing triadic relationship among exercise, gut microbiota, and sleep. It examines how exercise influences microbial diversity, the production of sleep-related metabolites like serotonin, GABA, and SCFAs, and immune responses that collectively shape sleep architecture. Additionally, the review highlights physiological factors influenced by exercise\u2014such as gut motility, intestinal barrier function, and bile acid metabolism\u2014that may impact the gut ecosystem and, in turn, sleep. Although encouraging results, deficiencies persist in our comprehension of the specific mechanisms connecting these domains. This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary research and suggests that targeting the gut microbiota via customized exercise interventions presents a promising, non-pharmacological strategy for enhancing sleep quality.",

      "title": "Feasibility of decoding cerebellar movement-related potentials for brain-computer interface applications",
      "content": "Objective. In brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, signals are conventionally acquired from the cerebrum, and only a subset of the complex interactions that occur in several areas of the brain are collected. One area that has not been investigated for BCI application is the cerebellum, despite its involvement in movement and executive function. The present study aimed to determine the features of movement-related cerebellar electrocerebellography (ECeG) that are most useful for decoding, and how performance compares with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cerebrum. Approach. ECeG and EEG data were collected from six healthy adults to identify useful movement-related features from both cerebrum and cerebellum. Electromyography was used to capture the movements from the muscles. Decoding was conducted in binary movement vs. rest and movement vs. movement systems using support vector machines. Decoding performance was compared between cerebral, cerebellar, a combination of both, and temporal groups. Re-referencing techniques were applied to compensate for possible common reference artefacts or volume conduction effects. Main results. Movement-related features were decoded from over the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Classification accuracies were similar in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, when classifying movement vs. rest (cerebrum: 0.78 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and movement vs. movement states (cerebrum: 0.76 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.71 \u00b1 0.02). The delta band (1\u20133 Hz) was the most useful feature for decoding. Significance. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ECeG is a feasible source of movement related signals for implementing a BCI. The present study also demonstrated that the ECeG closely resembled the EEG signals and represents an alternate approach for BCI where the signal from the cerebrum is unreliable either due to disease or injury.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.
