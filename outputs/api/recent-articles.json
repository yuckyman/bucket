      "content": "This study examined the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to measure real-time cognitive engagement during English-speaking tasks among Thai undergraduate students. A total of 41 participants took part in a mock job interview while wearing a five-channel EEG headset, which captured brain activity in the beta and gamma frequency bands. The EEG data were analyzed to identify variations in neural activation associated with speaking performance. Descriptive analyses revealed that participants with higher speaking scores generally exhibited increased beta and gamma wave activity, indicating greater attentional focus and semantic processing. However, nonparametric tests showed no statistically significant differences in neural activation between the lowest- and highest-scoring groups, suggesting that cognitive engagement may not always correspond directly with observable speaking performance. These results emphasize that even lower-performing learners may exhibit strong mental effort during communication, and that EEG can serve as a valuable tool for understanding hidden cognitive processes and informing more personalized language instruction and assessment.",

      "content": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been studied in clinical and laboratory contexts, but the rise of consumer-grade devices now allows exploration of their use in daily activities. Virtual reality (VR) provides a particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360\u00b0 cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. While the differing confirmation pipelines limit direct comparison of throughput metrics, NeuroGaze is positioned as a feasibility study illustrating trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and accessibility. It highlights the potential of consumer-grade BCIs for long-duration use and emphasizes the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

      "title": "Calibration of MRI-based reference intervals to new samples",
      "content": "Reference intervals, defined as intervals containing a new observation with a specified probability relative to reference data, would be clinically useful in assessing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain charts, which are estimates of MRI phenotypes across covariates such as age and sex, can be used to construct reference intervals. However, the reference data used to fit intervals often differs from a new sample in terms of study design, MRI acquisition, and image preprocessing. Application of MRI reference intervals to new samples remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method called Reference interval calibration via conFormal prediction (ReForm) that adjusts reference intervals for a new sample. Our method builds on recent work in conformal prediction, which yields intervals with guaranteed coverage for new observations. Through resampling experiments in Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium cortical thickness data, we compare ReFormed reference intervals to refitting intervals, statistical harmonization methods, and model-based adjustment of intervals. Notably for patient privacy concerns, ReForm does not require sharing of reference data. Yet, our empirical results demonstrate that ReForm controls FPR similarly or better than alternative methods which require sharing reference data. Finally, we provide recommendations for practical applications of ReForm and an R package (https://github.com/andy1764/ReForm) for calibrating reference intervals using ReForm.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",
