      "title": "Dendrite-targeting OLM interneurons regulate the formation of learning-related CA1 place cell representations",
      "content": "Spatial learning depends on the rapid formation of hippocampal CA1 place cell representations through behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). BTSP is driven by dendritic calcium plateau potentials in the distal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and is thought to arise from the interaction of an excitatory target signal from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3) with inhibitory feedback reflecting the current CA1 population state. However, the cellular source of this feedback remains unknown. To identify this circuit element, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with bidirectional optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of dendrite-targeting oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons. We found that axonal and somatic activity of OLM interneurons increased with learning and was spatially biased toward behaviorally salient locations, closely matching the evolving CA1 population representation and the environment-specific EC3 target signal. Causal manipulations revealed that optogenetic silencing of Chrna2alpha-positive OLM interneurons, a genetically defined OLM subset, late in learning increased dendritic plateaus and promoted place cell formation at stimulated locations, whereas activation of the same population early in learning suppressed plateau initiation and place field formation. Together, these findings identify OLM interneurons as the key inhibitory feedback element that dynamically regulates BTSP and stabilizes hippocampal representations during learning.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "An augmented preference-based Bayesian approach for optimizing neuromodulation stimulation parameters using meta learning",
      "content": "Background. Electrical neuromodulation is increasingly used in the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the selection of stimulation parameters that provide optimal therapeutic benefits remains a major challenge. Moreover, identifying pathological biomarkers linking the effect of stimulation parameters to alleviating symptoms, and hence required for optimizing stimulation parameters, might not always be possible. Objective. We present an augmented, preference-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize stimulation parameters for participants undergoing neuromodulation. This algorithm incorporates two key features: I) It prioritizes the participant\u2019s preferences for stimulation parameters, making it independent of the need for pathological biomarkers. II) It leverages meta learning, using historical participant data to guide the initial optimization for new participants and overcome initial data sparsity. This approach improves both prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Approach. Consider preference training data collected from a set of historical participants who share the same neurological disorder as a new (target) participant. Within that population, there may be different response phenotypes. The goal is to identify historical participants whose stimulation-response phenotype is most similar to the target participant, and leverage their data to accelerate and improve parameter optimization for the target participant. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively performs a two-step process:(I) a novel, iterative weighting procedure that identifies historical participants with stimulation preferences closest to the target participant, and (II) meta learning that combines the training data of the identified participants with the limited training data of the target participant to train novel, augmented preference learning models. These models are then used to predict the stimulation parameters expected to maximize the target participant\u2019s preference. Mainresults. The proposed algorithm has been validated using synthetically generated data sets that simulate participant preference behavior during neuromodulation. Significance. This approach holds promise for improving personalized neuromodulation therapies and advancing treatment outcomes for neurological disorders without the need for a tedious data collection process and disease-specific pathological biomarkers.",

      "title": "STeCANet: spatio-temporal cross attention network for brain computer interface systems using EEG-fNIRS signals",
      "content": "Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging fusion has shown promise in enhancing brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) performance by capturing complementary neural dynamics. However, most existing fusion frameworks inadequately model the temporal asynchrony and adaptive fusion between electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), thereby limiting their ability to generalize across sessions and subjects. This work aims to develop an adaptive fusion framework that effectively aligns and integrates EEG and fNIRS representations to improve cross-session and cross-subject generalization in BCI applications. Approach. To address this, we propose STeCANet, a novel Spatiotemporal Cross-Attention Network that integrates EEG and fNIRS signals through hierarchical attention-based alignment. The model leverages fNIRS-guided spatial attention, EEG-fNIRS temporal alignment, adaptive fusion, and adversarial training to ensure robust cross-modal interaction and spatiotemporal consistency. Main results. Evaluations across three cognitive paradigms, namely motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and word generation, demonstrate that STeCANet significantly outperforms unimodal and recent multimodal baselines under both session-independent and subject-independent settings. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each sub-module and loss function, including the domain adaptation component, in boosting classification accuracy and robustness. Significance. These results suggest that STeCANet offers a robust and interpretable solution for next-generation BCI applications.",

      "title": "Binocular vision emerges from the coordinated development of orbit convergence, eye orientation, and high-acuity retinal specializations",
      "content": "Binocular vision requires both eyes to be aligned such that their visual fields overlap. A long-standing premise derived from comparative studies is that the orientation of the orbits determines eye position, and thereby the extension of this overlap, the binocular field. In addition, to produce an accurate neural representation, the binocular field must integrate with the position of retinal high-acuity areas and with the extent of uncrossed retinal projections. It remains unknown, however, whether the binocular field is already formed at the time of eye-opening, as well as when and how it integrates with neuroanatomical visual traits during development. Using the diurnal rodent Octodon degus, a suitable animal model for visual neuroscience, we combined CT-based 3D cranial reconstructions, quantitative measurements of visual-field geometry, whole-mount retinal topography, neural tracing of retinal projections, and behavioral assays to reconstruct the postnatal assembly of the binocular visual system. We show that orbital and ocular orientations shift substantially after birth, broadening the dorsal binocular field; that retinal ganglion cell distributions sharpen into a horizontal visual streak and a defined area centralis; and that ipsilateral projections to the superior colliculus mature in parallel to binocular expansion. These changes coincide with the emergence of binocular-dependent behaviors such as depth discrimination and looming-evoked escape responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that binocular vision emerges through the coordinated alignment of multiple developmental processes across levels of organization.",
