      "title": "BDNF-TrkB signaling promotes synaptic GluN2A-NMDA receptor expression and network hyperexcitability in cultured hippocampal neurons and during status epilepticus",
      "content": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of synaptic function, acting through activation of TrkB receptors. This neurotrophic factor mediates synaptic plasticity and plays an important role in epileptogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this work, we investigated the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the regulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (NMDAR), and the impact on network synchronization in cultured hippocampal neurons . Incubation with BDNF increased the synaptic surface expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR in rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes and in cultured hippocampal neurons. The effect in the latter preparation was time- dependent and required new protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we identified a signaling cascade involving hnRNPK, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2, and protein kinase C (PKC) as essential for mediating BDNF - induced upregulation in the synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR. Knockdown of hnRNPK or Pyk2, pharmacological inhibition of PKC, or expression of a phosphorylation -deficient Pyk2 mutant abolished BDNF-induced synaptic surface accumulation of Glu2A. Moreover, Pyk2 phosphorylation at Y402 was necessary for both basal and BDNF-induced synaptic GluN2A expression. Functional multielectrode array (MEA) recordings showed that endogenous BDNF and GluN2A-containing NMDAR contributed to the increase in network activity in cultured hippocampal neurons evoked by stimulation with a cocktail including bicuculline, 4-aminopyridine, and glycine. Importantly, BDNF-TrkB signaling also mediated the upregulation in the hippocampal synaptic surface expression of GluN2A -containing NMDAR, as determined in rats subjected to the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, where increased GluN2A synaptic expression was observed and shown to be TrkB-dependent. These findings unveil a crucial BDNF/TrkB-PKC-Pyk2-hnRNPK signaling axis that regulates synaptic GluN2A levels and network excitability, offering novel insights into the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.",

      "title": "Targeted Intestinal Cooling Offers Superior Brain Protection in the Mouse Stroke Model",
      "content": "Background: Intestinal immune and inflammatory response plays a detrimental role following a stroke. This study aims to evaluate the brain protective efficacies of a novel intestinal cooling (CC) technique relative to the body surface cooling (SC) and the normothermic (NT) condition in a mouse stroke model. Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to CC (n=13), SC (n=15), or NT (n=11) groups. They underwent 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 7-day reperfusion. Both head and intra-colon temperatures were maintained at 37{degrees}C for 30 min before, during, and 30 min after MCAO. At 30 min reperfusion, a cooling catheter was placed to maintain intra-colon at 37{degrees}C in NT or 12{degrees}C in CC. The head temperature was maintained at 37{degrees}C in NT and 30{degrees}C in CC. In SC, both intra-colon and head temperatures were maintained at 30{degrees}C. Cooling lasted 3 hours. Bodyweight, behavioral deficits (nesting and pole test), and survival rate were assessed post-MCAO. At day 7 post-MCAO, mice were perfusion-fixed for histopathological analysis. Results: Post-stroke histopathological brain injury areas and volume were significantly reduced in CC, and appeared reduced though not statistically significant in SC, relative to NT. Compared with NT, body weight, nest building activity, and pole test were all significantly recovered in CC post-MCAO. In SC, only nest building improved significantly, while body weight and pole test showed marginal, nonsignificant trends. Consistent with functional recovery, survival was significantly improved in CC but not in SC, compared with NT. Conclusion: In a murine model, our novel CC technique successfully achieved targeted intestinal cooling while preserving safe upper-body temperatures necessary for normal cardiopulmonary function. Targeted intestinal cooling provides significant benefits superior to SC and NT, including smaller stroke volume, fewer functional deficits, and lower mortality rates, thus supporting the novel concept that the intestines are potential therapeutic targets for stroke management.",

      "title": "Ecological cues orchestrate concerted courtship in a Drosophila host specialist",
      "content": "Mating decisions are often attributed to the sensory signaling between prospective sexual partners. Yet these interactions are also shaped by the broader environmental context in which they unfold, to appropriately align sexual arousal with reproductive opportunities. Here we show that in the host specialist Drosophila erecta mating is strictly contingent on the ecological and social environment generated as flies densely aggregate on a food patch. We find that food volatiles directly promote male sexual arousal, triggering individuals to sample and pursue potential mates, giving rise to dynamic interactions across the group. The ensuing visual motion transforms each male's visual field, which in turn further amplifies his arousal, generating a multisensory feedback loop that coordinately promotes courtship across individuals. D.erecta's strict dependence on environmental cues appears latent in related species, such as D. melanogaster, where food odor can promote arousal but is dispensable for vigorous courtship. Comparative circuit analyses reveal that species-specific thresholds for sexual arousal reflect variation in how olfactory input modulates conserved nodes controlling courtship drive, rendering food volatiles a strict sensory gate only in D. erecta. Together, our findings highlight how ecological cues not directly tied to sexual signaling can profoundly influence reproductive behavior and reorganize the social landscape to ensure mating occurs in contexts where reproductive opportunities are abundant.",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations.

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
