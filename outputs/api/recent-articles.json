      "content": "Major depressive disorder arises from diverse neurobiological mechanisms, yet how specific habenular cell types contribute to distinct depressive-like behaviours remains unclear. Using chronic social defeat stress, behavioural phenotyping, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped stress-induced transcriptional changes across habenular cell types and lateral habenula (LHb) subregions. Our findings reveal that each behavioural phenotype is marked by its own transcriptional profile. These subregion-specific patterns across the LHb suggest that different cellular circuits contribute uniquely to depressive-like states.",

I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store. </p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> </p> <p>TidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders. </p> <p><em>The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.</em> </p> <p>This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules. </p> <p>The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.</p> <p>Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool. </p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases. </p> <p>Check out the app at: <a href=\"https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit\">TidyBit GitHub Repository</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swaroop_34\"> /u/swaroop_34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "I built a library that brings autocomplete back to pytest mocks",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I developed a Python library called typed-pytest during the Christmas holiday. It's now available on PyPI (v0.1.0 - early beta).</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>typed-pytest is a type-safe mocking library for pytest. When you use MagicMock(MyClass) in pytest, your IDE loses all autocomplete - you can't see the original class methods, and mock assertions like assert_called_once_with() have no type hints.</p> <p>typed-pytest fixes this by providing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Full IDE autocomplete for both original class methods and mock assertion methods</strong></li> <li><strong>Lint-time typo detection - misspelled method names are caught by mypy/pyright before tests run</strong></li> <li><strong>Type-checked mock properties - return_value, side_effect, call_count are properly typed</strong></li> <li><strong>Stub generator CLI - generates project-specific type stubs for your classes</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>from typed_pytest_stubs import typed_mock, UserService mock = typed_mock(UserService) mock.get_usr # \u274c Caught by type checker: &quot;get_usr&quot; is not a known member mock.get_user.assert_called_once_with(1) # \u2705 Autocomplete + type-checked! </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>Python developers who use pytest with mocks and want better IDE support and type safety. Especially useful for those practicing TDD or working with AI coding assistants where fast feedback on syntax errors is important.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>The standard unittest.mock.MagicMock provides no type information - your IDE treats everything as Any. Some developers use cast() to recover the original type, but then you lose access to mock-specific methods like assert_called_with().</p> <p>typed-pytest gives you both: original class signatures AND mock method type hints, all with full IDE autocomplete.</p> <p>Check out the project at: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest\">https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest</a></p> <p><strong>Still early beta - feedback, contributions, and \u2b50 are all appreciated!</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kr_roach\"> /u/kr_roach </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[comments]</a></span>",
