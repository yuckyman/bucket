      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Return of the GEDAI: Unsupervised EEG Denoising based on Leadfield Filtering",
      "content": "Current electroencephalogram (EEG) denoising methods struggle to remove the complex physiological and environmental artifacts typical of real-world settings, which both hinders the isolation of true neural activity and limits the technology's translational potential. We present the Generalized Eigenvalue De-Artifacting Instrument (GEDAI), a novel algorithm for denoising highly contaminated EEG. GEDAI employs leadfield filtering to selectively remove noise and artifacts that diverge from a theoretically defined EEG forward model. This approach offers unique advantages over existing solutions, including 1) denoising of highly corrupt recordings without clean reference data, 2) single-step correction of artifactual epochs and bad channels, 3) unsupervised detection of brain and noise components based on the signal and noise subspace alignment index (SENSAI). In ground-truth simulations with synthetic and empirical EEG contaminated with realistic artifacts (EOG, EMG, noise), GEDAI globally outperformed leading denoising techniques based on principal component analysis (ASR) and independent component analysis (IClabel, MARA), revealing large effect sizes in challenging scenarios with simultaneous artifact mixtures, low signal-to-noise ratio (-9 dB), and high temporal contamination (up to 100%). Its superior denoising also enhanced neurobehavioral predictions, yielding highest accuracies in ERP classification and brain fingerprinting. GEDAIs autonomy, computational speed and noise-resilience could find future applications in 1) real-world medical, mobile and dry electrode EEG recordings 2) magnetoenecephalography (MEG) denoising (given the shared M/EEG forward model), and 3) real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The Matlab code for GEDAI is available as an open-source EEGLAB plugin at https://github.com/neurotuning/GEDAI-master",
