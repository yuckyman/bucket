      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Neural Responses Underlying Interaural Time Difference Discrimination as a Function of Sensory Reliability in the Barn Owl",
      "content": "<p>Discrimination of sensory stimuli is fundamentally constrained by the information encoded in neuronal responses. In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls of either sex, we found that ITD just-noticeable differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC values. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing.</p>",

      "title": "Active Zone Maturation Controls Presynaptic Output and Release Mode and Is Regulated by Neuronal Activity",
      "content": "<p>Synapse formation requires the accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs). At <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larval neuromuscular junctions, a sequential process of AZ maturation is observed, with initial incorporation of early scaffolds followed by arrival of late scaffolds and VGCCs. To examine how AZ maturation regulates presynaptic output, serial imaging of AZ formation and function was performed at time-stamped synapses of male larvae expressing glutamate receptors linked to the photoconvertible protein mMaple. Quantal imaging demonstrated older synapses have higher synaptic efficacy and sustain greater release across development, while immature sites lacking VGCC accumulation supported spontaneous fusion. To examine how activity regulates AZ maturation, the effects of cell autonomous disruptions to neurotransmitter release were analyzed. Decreased synaptic transmission reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of material at existing AZs. Generation of an endogenous photoconvertible version of the AZ scaffold protein BRP revealed neuronal silencing decreased the protein's turnover. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in <i>rab3</i> mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Endogenous tagging of the Unc13B early AZ scaffold and the Unc13A late AZ scaffold revealed activity reduction decreased seeding of both early and late scaffolds, in contrast to <i>rab3</i> mutants. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation regulates presynaptic release mode and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Learning novel facts is central to modern life. While cortical regions involved in this process have been identified, the neural substrates underlying successful knowledge acquisition have remained elusive. In this fMRI study, we presented human participants (<i>N</i>&nbsp;= 29; 7, male) with a naturalistic learning task where 120 fictitious encyclopedic facts relating to people or places drawn from three imaginary civilizations. We then compared items that were subsequently recalled to those that were forgotten on a memory test that targeted associative learning, administered on average a day and a half later. To complement univariate analysis, we used multivariate pattern analysis to identify regions sensitive to semantic content during encoding, identifying medial precuneus, left angular gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and the lateral anterior temporal lobes (latATL) bilaterally. Within these regions, the strength of informational content within the precuneus and left latATL predicted subsequent retrieval. In contrast, planned analyses did not find univariate differences between remembered and forgotten facts. Targeted follow-up region of interest analysis indicated a possible role of response magnitude in the left inferior frontal gyrus and no univariate or multivariate effects within medial temporal lobe structures. Collectively, these results support a model of fact learning predominantly driven by the richness of representations within semantic systems that is partially distinct from episodic learning mechanisms.</p>",

      "title": "Intrinsic Dendritic Integration Features of Prefrontal Layer 5 Pyramidal Cell Subclasses",
      "content": "<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an associative center that integrates various inputs to support cognition. Layer 5 pyramidal cells are themselves associative centers, as their dendrites span all cortical layers and sample multiple input streams. Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are an important mechanism for integrating synaptic inputs arriving at distinct dendritic locations. bAPs originating in the axon initial segment can depolarize the apical dendrite, activate voltage-gated currents that underlie dendritic processing and synaptic plasticity, and influence the integration of synaptic inputs arriving onto apical dendrites. How effectively bAPs depolarize apical dendrites depends on the cell type, dendritic morphology, and the dendrite's passive and active properties. Here, we found that in a unique subclass of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cell defined by D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) expression, dendritic calcium responses to bAP stimuli were far greater for a burst of APs than expected from a linear sum of single AP-evoked events in mice of either sex. D3R-expressing neurons electrophysiologically resemble intratelencephalic, D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons but morphologically resemble pyramidal tract, D2R-expressing pyramidal neurons. In both D1R- and D2R-expressing cells, burst-evoked dendritic calcium events largely reflected a linear sum of individual AP responses. In D1R neurons, this was partially due to large-/big-conductance calcium&ndash;activated potassium (BK) channels, while in D2R neurons, both BK and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide&ndash;gated channels contributed. These data demonstrate that the intrinsic dendritic excitability of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cells widely differs and suggest that nonlinear dendritic excitability in D3R-expressing neurons uniquely positions these cells within PFC circuits.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The relationship of the brain&rsquo;s intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) during the resting state with event-related activity in response to external stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we bridge this gap by combining computational modeling with human magnetoencephalography (MEG, resting state: <i>N</i> = 64, 45 female; task state: <i>N</i> = 58, 41 female) data to investigate the relation of INTs with task-related activity, e.g., event-related fields (ERFs). Using the Jansen&ndash;Rit model, we first show that intracolumnar (and thus intraregional) excitatory and inhibitory connections (rather than interregional feedback, feedforward, and lateral connections between the columns of different regions) strongly influence both resting-state INTs and task-related ERFs. Secondly, our results demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of event-related fields (mERFs) and INTs, observed in both model simulations and empirical MEG data collected during an emotional face recognition task. Thirdly, modeling shows that the positive relationship of mERF and INT depends on intracolumnar connections through observing that the correlation between them disappears for fixed values of intracolumnar connections. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intracolumnar connections as a shared biological mechanism underlying both the resting state&rsquo;s INTs and the task state&rsquo;s event-related activity including their interplay.</p>",

      "title": "CaMKII Drives Synaptic Maturation by Coordinating Spine Remodeling and Receptor Segregation via Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation",
      "content": "<p>A hallmark of mature excitatory synapses is their localization on dendritic spines, which increase in number and enlarge during development. Recent super-resolution studies have uncovered another key feature of mature synapses&mdash;an intricate synaptic nanoarchitecture. Trans-synaptic nanocolumns align AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) nanodomains with presynaptic release sites, ensuring efficient synaptic transmission as neurons mature. However, the mechanism by which these key features of synaptic maturation emerge remains unclear. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a signaling molecule implicated in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission. Recent findings show CaMKII, beyond its function as a kinase, serves as a structural element through its ability to undergo liquid&ndash;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Upon activation in vitro, it segregates AMPAR from NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR), forming biphasic condensates. Given that CaMKII expression increases during development, we hypothesized that it serves as the driving force behind synaptic maturation. Using super-resolution microscopy and primary hippocampal cultures prepared from embryonic rat pups of both sexes, we found that immature neurons, which express lower levels of CaMKII, exhibit smaller spine density and size and less-developed AMPAR and NMDAR nanodomain segregation compared with mature neurons. Remarkably, overexpressing CaMKII in immature neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the features of mature synapses, by increasing spine density, size, and receptor nanodomain segregation. Conversely, a single CaMKII mutation (I205K), which prevents LLPS, abolished these effects. Our findings support that CaMKII-mediated LLPS is the driving force shaping the mature synaptic landscape, suggesting a previously overlooked mechanistic link between dendritic spine formation, enlargement, and receptor nanodomain organization.</p>",

      "title": "The Hidden Benefits of Noise: Low-Frequency tRNS and Dynamic Visual Noise Enhance Visual Processing",
      "content": "<p>Sensory and perceptual processing are inherently shaped by both internal and external noise sources. While noise is typically seen as disruptive, it can, under certain conditions, enhance the detection of weak sensory signals&mdash;a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). Research on SR has primarily focused on dissimilar noise sources such as static visual noise or high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS), leaving it unclear whether different noise types produce similar enhancements or operate through shared mechanisms. Here, we investigated how three external noise sources&mdash;hf-tRNS, low-frequency tRNS (lf-tRNS), and dynamic visual noise (DVN)&mdash;affect visual contrast detection, adopting an individualized analytical approach to account for variability in internal noise across participants. DVN was specifically designed to mirror the spatiotemporal characteristics of tRNS, enabling systematic evaluation of cortical- and sensory-level noise within a unified framework. Across three experiments (<i>n</i> = 149 of either sex), all noise types improved detection performance at participant-specific optimal intensities, with the most pronounced effects observed for subthreshold stimuli and in participants with lower baseline sensitivity, consistent with a compensatory role of external noise when perceptual encoding is weak. Notably, these results provide the first evidence of SR-like benefits from lf-tRNS, challenging frequency-dependent assumptions about the efficacy of electrical noise stimulation. Comparable enhancements with DVN further establish it as a promising noninvasive tool for perceptual modulation. Together, these findings expand the SR framework by demonstrating that both electrical and sensory noise can facilitate vision and highlight the importance of individualized approaches in neuromodulation and sensory enhancement.</p>",

      "title": "Selective Attention Shapes Neural Representations of Complex Auditory Scenes: The Roles of Object Identity and Scene Composition",
      "content": "<p>Everyday auditory scenes contain overlapping sound objects, requiring attention to isolate relevant objects from irrelevant background objects. This study examined how selective attention shapes neural representations of complex sound scenes in the auditory cortex (AC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activity from participants (12 males, 8 females) as they attended to a designated object in scenes comprising three overlapping sounds. Scenes were constructed in two manners: one where each object belonged to a different category (speech, animal, instrument) and another where all objects were from the same category. Attending to speech enhanced activations in lateral AC subfields, while attention to animal and instrument sounds preferentially modulated medial AC subfields, supporting models where attention modulates feature-selective neural gain in AC. Remarkably, however, spatial pattern analysis revealed that the attended object dominated the AC activation patterns of the entire scene in a manner depending on both object type and scene composition: When scene objects belonged to different categories, attention effects were dominated by category-level processing. In contrast, when all scene objects shared the same category, dominance shifted to exemplar-level processing in fields processing acoustic features. Thus, attention seems to dynamically prioritize the features offering maximal contrast within a given context, emphasizing object-specific patterns in feature-similar scenes and category-level patterns in feature-diverse scenes. Our results support models where top-down signals not only modulate gain but also affect scene decomposition and analysis&mdash;influencing stream segregation and gating of higher-level processing in a contextual manner, adapting to specific auditory environments.</p>",
