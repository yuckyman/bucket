      "title": "Ca2+-mediated protein citrullination regulates proliferation in the regenerating and malignant CNS",
      "content": "Unlike most adult mammals, regenerative vertebrates can awaken dormant neural stem cells in response to injury. Understanding how this process is regulated could guide strategies to activate stem cells for tissue repair and limit aberrant proliferation in cancers of the CNS. Here, using zebrafish injury models and high-speed live imaging, we identify hydrodynamically-activated Ca2+; signalling as a key driver of neural stem cell activation. Local injury-associated changes in CSF flow activate mechanoreceptors at the site of spinal cord lesions, triggering pulsatile Ca2+ activity and progenitor proliferation. We identify Ca2+-regulated peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) as key downstream effectors that citrullinate intracellular targets in a Ca2+-dependent manner to drive progenitor activation. Finally, we show that PAD inhibitors suppress the growth of aggressive medulloblastoma cells in preclinical laboratory models. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism of proliferation control in the vertebrate CNS and highlight the value of regenerative studies for identifying therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Precision in Motion: Reactive and Anticipatory Control of Mouse Tongue Movement for Interception",
      "content": "The ability to perform high precision motor actions to intercept moving objects is fundamental to animal motor behavior, whereby organisms must constantly adapt to a dynamic environment. Such interception tasks rely on tightly integrating predictive internal models and moment-to-moment sensory feedback, a hallmark of complex sensorimotor transformations. Studying interception behavior thus offers a unique window into how the brain flexibly coordinates perception and action in real time. However, traditional behavioral paradigms to study sensorimotor control in head fixed mice, often rooted in classical conditioning, simplify these complex processes into predictable, rigid stimulus response routines. Consequently, these paradigms fail to capture key ethological features of interception, such as the continuous dynamic nature of sensory input and direct physical interaction with moving objects. Our task bridges this gap by integrating naturalistic elements of interceptive behavior with precise experimental control. We introduce a behavioral task in which head fixed mice use their tongue to intercept a food pellet moving at constant speeds, randomly changing from trial to trial. We describe details of the 3D kinematics of discrete tongue reaching movements, their distinctive motor phases, and their learning dependent changes in onset and kinematics. We show that mice adjust their tongue kinematics and movement onset relative to varying pellet speeds, using distinctive reactive and anticipatory strategies. We demonstrate that the anticipatory strategy depends partially on vision and on intact lateral cerebellar circuits. Our novel behavioral paradigm is a valuable tool for exploring the neural basis of sensory motor transformation during object interception in head-fixed mice.",

      "title": "Data-Driven Retrieval of Effective Point Spread Functions for Super-Resolution Optoacoustic Imaging",
      "content": "Localization-based super-resolution techniques have revolutionized biomedical imaging by surpassing classical diffraction limits. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by distortions of the point spread function (PSF) induced by the system and the sample, which are particularly prominent in the case of spatially under-sampling. Here we introduce a data-driven effective point spread function retrieval (DEPR) method that directly learns continuous, field-dependent system responses from experimental point source datasets. Through statistical aggregation of thousands of targets and iterative self-supervised refinement, DEPR captures spatially variant imaging characteristics in situ without prior assumptions or external calibrations.When integrated into the localization optoacoustic tomography (LOT) pipeline, DEPR achieves accurate sub-pixel localization despite under-sampled conditions, thus enhancing resolution while reducing computational burden. We demonstrate its efficacy by in vivo imaging of the murine brain microvasculature using microparticle contrast agents in the first (NIR-I) and second (NIR-II) near-infrared windows, achieving significant improvement in data utilization efficiency and substantial reduction of gridded artifacts compared to conventional approaches. The method resolves vascular structures with ~41 m separation across a ~3 mm imaging depth range. This framework addresses fundamental challenges shared across diverse localization-based imaging modalities, offering a robust and generalizable strategy for high-precision imaging in complex biological systems.",

      "title": "A brain dynamic model based on graph neural network reflect the inter-region interaction of cortical areas",
      "content": "A central objective in neuroscience is to elucidate how the brain generates complex dynamic activity through the interactions of brain areas. In this study, we utilized Interaction Network, a graph neural network model, to develop a computational framework for predicting whole-brain cortical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. We derived an Inter-Regional Interaction (IRI) metric to quantify information exchange among brain areas probing the underlying dynamical mechanisms. In addition, the total IRI emitted from each brain region was calculated and defined as the IRI sent by region (RS-IRI). Our model predicted the following 10 time points BOLD activity from initial BOLD signals, and achieved a mean absolute error of 0.04. The predicted functional connectivity (FC) achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.97 compared to the empirical FC. The fluctuation amplitude of the IRI increases with the length of the connection and the largest RS-IRI oscillation amplitude is observed in visual areas. The RS-IRI demonstrates a hierarchical organization, characterized by more concentrated distributions in association regions and larger fluctuation amplitudes in unimodal regions. Applying our approach to Alzheimers disease (AD), we demonstrate that the frequency-specific amplitudes of IRI oscillations discriminate AD patients from healthy controls and correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Together, this work presents a deep learning-based framework for modeling brain dynamics as well a quantitative index of inter-areal interactions, and offers a new perspective for disease characterization.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

      "title": "Electro-Calcium uncoupling precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is categorized as a neurodegenerative disease, but there is a growing recognition of the vascular components in AD pathophysiology. Reduction in cerebral perfusion is routinely observed in AD patients and preclinical models prior to overt clinical symptoms. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of the early neurovascular deficits in AD, and how these may ultimately contribute to pathology. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of early neurovascular dysfunction in AD by using 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a familial mouse model of AD. Functional hyperemia-the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to neuronal activity-is driven by inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1)-mediated hyperpolarizing (electrical) signals and Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide production within the capillary endothelial cells (cECs). Electrical and Ca2+ signals are tightly coupled through cECs membrane potential, referred to as Electro-Calcium (E- Ca) coupling. We hypothesize that E-Ca uncoupling contributes to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and that these neurovascular deficits precede the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. At three months of age, 5xFAD mice did not exhibit any impairment in spatial learning and memory, or neuronal density. However, whisker stimulation-induced functional hyperemia was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice compared to controls. Functional hyperemia exhibited a bimodal response in controls-consisting of fast and slow phases-with the slow phase being significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. To identify mechanisms underlying these deficits, we measured cortical neuronal and endothelial Ca2+ activity using in-vivo imaging. Neuronal Ca2+ activity was comparable between controls and 5xFAD mice, while cECs Ca2+ activity was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, Kir2.1 channel blocker, barium (100 M) significantly suppressed cECs Ca2+ activity in controls, but not in 5xFAD mice, consistent with crippled E-Ca coupling. Despite these vascular functional impairments, capillary density was preserved in 5xFAD mice. TRPV4 channels are one of the major Ca2+ entry pathways in cECs and potentiate E-Ca coupling. cECs TRPV4 current density was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice while Kir2.1 current density was unchanged, indicating that impaired TRPV4 function underlies the E-Ca uncoupling. In summary, early E-Ca uncoupling leads to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and may contribute to later neuronal and cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Translational regulation of GAD1 identified by circadian and light-responsive ribosome-bound transcriptome analysis in the mouse hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus",
      "content": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master circadian pacemaker, integrating photic information to synchronize daily rhythms throughout the body. While transcriptional regulation of clock genes in the SCN has been extensively studied, whether gene expression in the SCN is regulated at the level of mRNA translation has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the first ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) dataset generated from the mouse SCN, enabling a genome-wide assessment of translational regulation in this central circadian clock. Combined time-series Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified 385 genes that exhibit rhythmic ribosome binding without corresponding oscillations in mRNA abundance, revealing widespread translational regulation in the SCN. Among these, light stimulation induced an approximately twofold increase in ribosome binding of Gad1, which encodes the major GABA-synthetic enzyme Gad67, despite only marginal changes in Gad1 mRNA levels. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated light-dependent accumulation of Gad67 protein selectively in light-activated SCN neurons, establishing that translational regulation of Gad1 gives rise to overt protein-level changes. In contrast, canonical clock genes were regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and showed little evidence of translational modulation. Our data allow a systematic comparison between transcriptionally and translationally regulated genes, including their relative rhythm-amplitudes and phases, and thereby revealed translational control as a distinct modulatory layer shaping time-of-day-dependent and light-dependent gene expression in the SCN.",
