      "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",
