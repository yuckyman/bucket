      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Cardiac activity impacts spinal cord excitability. A Call to Return to the Roots",
      "content": "The heart continuously shapes neural processing and behavior through cardiac-brain interactions. While cortical excitability fluctuations and their role in cardiac-dependent cognitive and sensorimotor phenomena have been extensively studied, the temporal dynamics and contribution of spinal excitability oscillations across the cardiac cycle remain poorly characterized. In this study, we examine whether motor evoked potentials elicited by magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord are modulated by the cardiac cycle phase in healthy participants. Real-time adapting ECG-triggered stimulation enabled precise targeting of five phases across the cardiac cycle. Spinal excitability was significantly phase-dependent, with MEPs peaking during late diastole. MEPs amplitude was also found to be modulated by preceding cardiac intervals, where shorter intervals predict stronger diastolic facilitation. These findings establish that spinal excitability is rhythmically modulated by the cardiac cycle, potentially through blood pressure-mediated mechanisms. Notably, the diastolic facilitation observed here contrasts with previously reported motor cortex excitability profiles, indicating a non-synchronous cardiac modulation of spinal versus cortical excitability. These results may benefit neuromodulation approaches for motor and psychiatric disorder treatment and emphasize the critical importance of including spinal measures in future heart-brain interaction studies.",

Here we present a comprehensive spatially-resolved proteome atlas of the human brain, analyzing over two thousand MRI-guided locations across four individuals.

Unsupervised molecular clustering defines distinct brain territories that transcend anatomical boundaries, instead reflecting metabolic demands and functional specialization patterns.

      "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

      "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
      "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

      "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
      "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Vocal communication is a complex social behavior that entails the integration of auditory perception and vocal production. Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",
