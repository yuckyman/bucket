      "title": "Corticosterone-linked microglial activity underpins sexually dimorphic neuroplasticity after ketamine anesthesia.",
      "content": "Anesthesia recovery is critical for resuming normal physiological and neuronal functions; however, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we identify a female-selective corticosterone-mediated microglia-neuron interaction in vivo during ketamine anesthesia recovery, absent in males. This microglia-neuron interaction induces plastic and functional neuronal changes, as evidenced by increased spine density and mEPSC frequency, which is occluded upon microglia depletion. We show that this process is driven through upregulation of the stress-responsive co-chaperone Fkbp5 mRNA and its protein, FKBP51, in female microglia. Fkbp5/FKBP51 is a key intermediary in a corticosteroid-induced stress response, and its involvement points towards a critical interface between endocrine signaling and microglia. Thus, to counteract the observed KXA-mediated corticosterone increase in the blood, we remove the primary source of corticosterone through adrenalectomy. Close microglia-neuron interaction was absent, but was reinstated after corticosterone injection. Our findings offer a new mechanism of microglia-mediated neuronal plasticity during anesthesia recovery, which is mediated through corticosterone, enhancing our understanding of sex differences in brain function.",

      "title": "Selective coupling and decoupling coordinate distributed brain networks for precise action",
      "content": "The mammalian brain is fundamentally interconnected. Across species, a single neuron typically forms thousands of synapses spanning local and long-range connections. This architecture suggests that brain function is distributed, but it remains poorly understood how relevant networks are selectively engaged to produce appropriate behaviors. To address this, we recorded >40,000 neurons, simultaneously monitoring five cerebellar and cerebral brain areas as mice performed complex motor actions, capturing interactions of >5,000,000 cross-area neuron pairs. This revealed that complex pre-movement cross-area interactions coordinate distributed networks to produce precise and consistent actions. Prior to action production, action-informative neural populations across the brain become coupled, while non-informative populations decouple. This coupling and decoupling was mirrored by two distinct local field potential oscillations linking neuron-level to population-level dynamics. External modulation of these dynamics revealed their necessity for skilled action. Our work highlights that a complex pre-movement orchestration of coupling and decoupling ensures the selective engagement of relevant distributed networks to produce precise action.",

      "title": "Patterns of intersubject correlations parallel organizational gradients during naturalistic viewing",
      "content": "Recent studies have robustly demonstrated that human cortical function can be described through sensory-transmodal gradients of cortical function, while naturalistic movie watching paradigms have been leveraged to index cortical synchronization. We leveraged two independent 7T movie fMRI acquisitions to assess correlations between these measures across movies, datasets, and spatial scales. At the whole-brain level, we observed robust relationships between intersubject correlations and a visual-transmodal connectivity gradient which was independent of movie content. Within functional networks, correlations were particularly pronounced for the visual, the dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Our results support the ability of naturalistic paradigms to offer targeted insight into multiscale processing hierarchies. Robust relationships across movies suggest that we might understand movie-watching as a brain state that is independent of movie-content. Overall, this work suggests an important confluence of within-subject functional organizational axes and inter-subject synchronization when the brain is engaged in the processing of naturalistic stimuli.",

      "content": "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a dosage-sensitive kinase with critical roles in the neuron-astrocyte axis. During brain development, DYRK1A ensures the proper number of differentiated neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, this DYRK1A regulates neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. However, its functions in astrocytes are not yet well defined, with limited evidence indicating roles in astrocyte reactivity and excitotoxicity. Due to trisomy 21, DYRK1A is overexpressed in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). This imbalance directly contributes to neuronal death and likely astrocyte pathology, accelerating the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in this population. Notably, DYRK1A overexpression also correlates with neurodegeneration and AD progression in elderly euploid adults. This correlation positions DYRK1A as a potential bridge between DS and AD, mechanistically connecting gene overdosage and neuropathology in both conditions. However, research on DYRK1A pathophysiology has primarily centered on neurons, leaving astrocytes largely understudied. Considering the vital neuroprotective functions of astrocytes, broadening DYRK1A research to encompass these cells presents an opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms contributing to the neurodegenerative process in AD. In this review, we highlight the physiology and pathology of DYRK1A in the neuron\u2013astrocyte axis, analyzing its roles in neurons and positing hypothetical functions in astrocytes, with particular emphasis on the contribution of DYRK1A\u2019s cell-specific overexpression to neurodegeneration and AD progression.",

      "content": "Touch plays a key role in our perception of our body and shapes our interactions with the world, from the objects we manipulate to the people we touch. While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",

These systems provide information on limb positioning, environmental interactions, and gait events, significantly improving mobility in amputees and their confidence about using such devices. This review summarizes recent progress in haptic...",

Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation techniques (NIBS) have entered the recognized guidelines for therapies in psychiatry due to the advantages related to safety and tolerability. The purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to assess if and how NIBS techniques are used and could be effective in the treatment of suicidal ideation. The search included the Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases....",

Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) and core stability exercises have shown promise in enhancing motor control and biomechanical alignment, but their combined effects on DKV remain unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of active versus sham tDCS combined with core stability exercises on knee kinematic alignment...",
