      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Explicit memory representations in decisions from experience",
      "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) models explain how people adapt behavior through incremental value updates, but assume that individual experiences are not explicitly stored or retrieved. Across two experiments (N=282 and N= 1,818), we tested whether people rely on such explicit memory representations during experience-based choice. Participants sampled outcomes from two lotteries and, in an \"ignore\" condition, were instructed to disregard specific outcomes before deciding. Ignoring these outcomes substantially altered preferences, suggesting that choices were guided by explicit episodic representations rather than cumulative reinforcement. Frequency judgments revealed generally accurate memory for experienced outcomes, but reduced precision for continuous compared with discrete outcome distributions. These findings challenge purely incremental RL accounts and support theories proposing that human choice integrates flexible episodic memory with reinforcement mechanisms, bridging models of learning, memory, and decision-making.",

      "title": "Impaired Peri-infarct Long-Term Potentiation Suggests Alternative Mechanisms of Post-stroke Recovery in Rats",
      "content": "Background: Early after stroke, a period of heightened plasticity in the peri-infarct cortex is thought to provide the physiological substrate for functional motor recovery through increased expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Prior slice electrophysiology studies on the capacity for LTP after stroke reported conflicting results. Slice preparation could have influenced the results by disrupting neuromodulatory processes altered after stroke. Therefore, whether LTP can be induced in the peri-infarct cortex remains to be elucidated. We investigated LTP in the peri-infarct cortex of anesthetized rats using a novel in vivo method that preserves local and long-range circuit dynamics. Methods: LTP, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were assessed under urethane anaesthesia in 15 rats (11 with focal stroke to the primary motor cortex, and 4 sham operated controls). Rats were tested one or two weeks after stroke using a minimally perturbed in vivo LTP induction protocol validated in naive rats. Motor function was evaluated using the cylinder test at baseline and at one or two-weeks post stroke. Results: LTP in the peri-infarct cortex was supressed in the stroke group compared to sham controls. In addition, synaptic transmission was reduced for higher stimulation intensities, and short-term plasticity shifted from facilitation to depression, indicating impaired synaptic function at one- and two-weeks post-stroke. Behaviorally, the lesioned rats exhibited motor deficits at one week but showed full recovery by two weeks post-stroke. Conclusion: In recovering animals, both LTP and synaptic transmission are profoundly impaired in the peri-infarct cortex. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than LTP- based plasticity underlie motor recovery during this stage.",

      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe Model Human Processor (MHP), while useful, lacks direct neurophysiological validation. This study aimed to validate and extend the MHP by analyzing P300 and Bereitschaftspotential (BP) brainwave components.MethodsOur initial finding of qualitatively different neural signatures between correct and incorrect trials led to the hypothesis that the \u201ccorrect\u201d trial group is a mixture of different processing types. We tested this by segregating correct trials based on the presence or absence of the P300 component, which we reasoned is a key marker of the MHP\u2019s conscious \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.ResultsWe identified a P300-absent subgroup even among correct responses. This subgroup exhibited significantly shorter reaction times than its P300-present counterpart and showed a neural signature strikingly similar to that of incorrect trials, including a delayed negative peak in the BP.DiscussionThese results suggest the human information processing pathway is not monolithic. We propose a new model that bifurcates after perception into either a \u201cDeliberate Process\u201d (P300-present), which aligns with the MHP, or a high-speed \u201cAutomatic Process\u201d (P300-absent) that bypasses the MHP\u2019s \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process. This work provides neurophysiological validation for the MHP and lends new neural support for dual-process theory.",

      "title": "From early symptoms to EEG silence: tracking the neurodegenerative course of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease",
      "content": "BackgroundSporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Early diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific initial symptoms. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is a key diagnostic tool, particularly through the detection of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs), the longitudinal evolution of EEG features and their correlation with clinical and neuroimaging progression are not fully characterized.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed 37 patients diagnosed with probable and very probable sCJD according to the 2021 Chinese diagnostic guidelines. All patients underwent at least one EEG examination. One representative patient was followed for 23\u202fweeks with serial EEG and MRI studies to document dynamic electrophysiological and structural changes. EEG background activity was graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and PSWCs were identified based on standardized criteria. MRI analyses focused on the spatial and temporal progression of hyperintense lesions on DWI and FLAIR sequences.ResultsAmong the 37 patients, 46% underwent initial EEG within 1\u202fmonth of symptom onset, and 49% exhibited severe background abnormalities. PSWCs were present in 84% of patients at first EEG, with a high prevalence (82%) even in those examined within 4\u202fweeks of onset. Longitudinal analysis in the index case revealed a progressive EEG deterioration: from slowed and disorganized background rhythms and emerging triphasic waves at 8\u202fweeks, to widespread PSWCs with increasing periodicity (9\u201316\u202fweeks), and finally to a burst-suppression pattern near electrical silence by week 23. Concurrent MRI showed a parallel expansion of hyperintense lesions from unilateral cortical and basal ganglia regions to bilateral involvement, closely correlated with the EEG progression. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between survival time and age, time to first EEG, CSF 14\u20133-3 protein status, or initial EEG background grade. Furthermore, neither the presence of typical PSWCs nor the severity of background activity was associated with survival outcomes.ConclusionEEG, especially the early and highly prevalent presence of PSWCs, offers high diagnostic value in sCJD but does not serve as prognostic predictors. The close correlation between EEG decline and MRI progression supports multimodal monitoring. Serial EEG should be integrated into sCJD diagnosis and follow-up.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

      "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",
