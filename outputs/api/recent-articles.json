      "title": "Benchmarking resting state fMRI connectivity pipelines for classification: Robust accuracy despite processing variability in cross-site eye state prediction",
      "content": "The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) methods has yielded promising results in human brain neuroscience. However, the reproducibility of ML applications in neuroimaging remains limited, challenging the generalizability of inferences to broader populations. In addition to the inherent variability of the brain activity (both in healthy and pathological states), poor reproducibility is further enhanced by inconsistencies in data preprocessing techniques and methods for calculating functional connectivity (FC), which are used as parameters for brain state classification. To systematically assess the impact of abovementioned factors on ML applications to fMRI data, we benchmarked a comprehensive set of FC analysis pipelines for the classification task between fMRI data recorded in two fundamentally different states: eyes open and eyes closed. In contrast to studies involving heterogeneous clinical populations or using complex cognitive tasks, our controlled experimental design - based on two independent datasets of healthy participants collected in different laboratories - minimizes variability related to a task design or pathological brain states. Classification accuracy and reproducibility were compared for 192 distinct FC analysis pipelines, covering common preprocessing approaches, brain parcellation schemes, and connectivity metrics. Notably, we employed a cross-site validation strategy, training predictive models on data from one site and testing them on the other. Despite the substantial variability in pipeline configurations, we observed consistently high classification accuracy (~80%), confirming that FC-based models can robustly discriminate between well-defined brain states (eye conditions) across different acquisition sites. Best results both in terms of classification accuracy and stability were observed using Pearson correlation and tangent correlation as FC, Brainnetome as atlas, and confound regression strategies based on the CompCor method. These findings highlight the resilience of rs-fMRI FC-derived characteristics to methodological variation and support their utility in the discovery of biomarkers, particularly in settings that involve stable and reproducible brain states.",

      "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
      "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.</p> <p><strong>What it does (quick reminder):</strong> Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:</p> <p>```python from func_to_web import run</p> <p>def divide(a: int, b: int): return a / b</p> <p>run(divide) # Web form at localhost:8000 ```</p> <p><strong>Major updates since v0.1:</strong></p> <p><strong>Dynamic Lists</strong> \u2013 Add/remove items with advanced validation: ```python def process_data( # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons images: list[ImageFile], # Multiple file uploads</p> <pre><code># Dual validation: list size AND individual items scores: Annotated[ list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], Field(min_length=3, max_length=10) ], # 3-10 items required, each 0-100 # Optional fields with toggle switches notes: str | None = None, # Optional text tags: list[str] | None = None # Optional list </code></pre> <p>): return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), &quot;report.pdf&quot;) # Auto-download ```</p> <p><strong>High-Performance File Handling</strong> \u2013 Optimized streaming for large files: - <strong>Upload</strong>: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files - <strong>Download</strong>: Return <code>FileResponse(data, filename)</code> for auto-downloads - <strong>Performance</strong>: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet - <strong>Memory efficient</strong>: Constant usage regardless of file size - <strong>Any format</strong>: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data</p> <p><strong>Optional Fields</strong> \u2013 <code>Type | None</code> creates toggle switches: - Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled - Explicit control: <code>Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled</code> - Works with all types, constraints, and lists</p> <p><strong>Dynamic Dropdowns</strong> \u2013 Runtime-generated options: ```python def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()</p> <p>def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass # Fresh options each request ```</p> <p><strong>Rich Output Support</strong>: - <strong>PIL Images</strong>: Auto-displayed in browser - <strong>Matplotlib plots</strong>: Rendered as PNG - <strong>File downloads</strong>: Single or multiple files with streaming - <strong>JSON/text</strong>: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard</p> <p><strong>UX Improvements</strong>: - Dark mode with theme persistence - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit) - Auto-focus first field - Toast notifications - Upload progress with speed indicators</p> <p><strong>Current stats:</strong> - 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!) - 454 unit tests - Published on PyPI: <code>pip install func-to-web</code> - 20+ runnable examples - Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies</p> <p><strong>Other improvements:</strong> - <strong>Modular architecture</strong>: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...) - <strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong>: Every function and class documented - <strong>Detailed changelog</strong>: Track all improvements and breaking changes</p> <p>I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.</p> <p>Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/offerrall/FuncToWeb\">https://github.com/offerrall/FuncToWeb</a></p> <p>The community feedback really shaped these improvements. Thank you again! Keep the suggestions coming.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/drboom9\"> /u/drboom9 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1obmzbm/functoweb_is_now_much_better_thanks_for_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1obmzbm/functoweb_is_now_much_better_thanks_for_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
