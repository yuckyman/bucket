      "title": "Levels of shared autonomy in brain-robot interfaces: enabling multi-robot multi-human collaboration for activities of daily living",
      "content": "Individuals with ALS and other severe motor impairments often rely on caregivers for daily tasks, which limits their independence and sense of control. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) have the potential to restore autonomy, but many existing systems are task-specific and highly automated, which reduces the users' sense of empowerment and limits opportunities to exercise autonomy. In particular, shared autonomy approaches hold promise for overcoming current BRI limitations, by balancing user control with increased robot capabilities. In this work, we introduce a collaborative BRI that integrates non-invasive EEG, EMG, and eye tracking to enable multi-user, multi-robot interaction in a shared kitchen environment with mobile manipulators. Our system modulates assistance through three levels of autonomy\u2014Assisted Teleoperation, Shared Autonomy, and Full Automation\u2014allowing users to retain meaningful control over task execution while reducing effort for routine operations. We conducted a controlled user study comparing autonomy conditions, evaluating performance, workload, ease of use, and agency. Our results show that, while Full Automation was generally preferred by users due to lower workload and higher usability, Shared Autonomy provided higher reliability and preserved user agency, especially in the presence of noisy EEG decoding. Although there was significant individual variability in EEG decoding performance, our post-hoc analysis revealed the potential benefits of customizing pipelines for each user. Finally, we note that our findings are specific to the multi-modal configuration tested and should not be interpreted as a universal claim about the superiority of any autonomy level, and, furthermore, our user study was limited by the use of healthy adults rather than target population (e.g., individuals with ALS), gender imbalance, and a relatively small sample size, which may affect generalizability.

      "content": "IntroductionThis study sought to identify early risk factors and develop a predictive model for progression from self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) accompanied by spike-and-wave activation in sleep (SWAS) to epileptic encephalopathy with SWAS (EE-SWAS), aiming to facilitate early clinical intervention.MethodsFrom a pediatric cohort with spike-and-wave index >50%, we analyzed 77 SeLECTS patients (33 progressed to EE-SWAS, 36 remained stable over \u22652 years of follow-up). Baseline clinical and EEG features were comprehensively evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of cognitive regression, which were incorporated into a nomogram-based predictive model. Model performance was assessed using the C-index in both derivation and external validation cohorts.ResultsProlonged spike-and-wave clusters, high-amplitude spikes with secondary generalization, and younger age at first seizure emerged as independent predictors of EE-SWAS progression. The nomogram model demonstrated high discriminative ability, with a C-index of 0.932 in the derivation cohort and 0.934 in external validation.ConclusionThis study provides the first validated tool for early risk stratification in SWAS-associated SeLECTS, enabling clinicians to anticipate EE-SWAS progression and optimize therapeutic strategies. The model\u2019s robustness supports its potential utility in clinical decision-making to mitigate cognitive decline.",

      "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding. The study provides proof-of-concept evidence for BSDS in auditory paradigms, showing the importance of attentional fluctuations and stimulus loudness in determining the strength and timing of neural speech tracking, with implications for the design of adaptive speech-enhancement strategies.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
