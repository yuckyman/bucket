      "content": "Postoperative pain remains a major clinical challenge, as inadequate management can delay functional recovery, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of chronic pain development. Opioid analgesics, while considered the gold standard for treating severe acute postoperative pain, are limited by adverse effects such as respiratory depression, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the latter being a key driver of persistent postoperative pain. Lapatinib, originally developed as an anticancer therapy, has recently shown analgesic potential in both preclinical and clinical studies. Importantly, unlike opioids, lapatinib does not appear to activate central reward pathways, thereby minimizing the risk of dependence. Although its efficacy has been investigated in several chronic pain models, its role in acute postoperative pain and the associated inflammatory response has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrated that lapatinib exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vitro by suppressing proinflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, MMP, chemokines, mPGES-1 and PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In a mouse model of postoperative pain, preoperative administration of lapatinib attenuated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. These behavioral effects were accompanied by decreased proinflammatory mediator expression (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, and mPGES-1) and increased IL-10 levels in the injured paw tissue. Our findings highlight lapatinib as a promising candidate for repurposing as a novel analgesic for postoperative pain. Its targeted mechanism of action and lower potential for adverse effects compared with opioids support further investigation into its clinical utility in pain management.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",
