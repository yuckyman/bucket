      "title": "Evolution of visual time throughout goal driven action learning",
      "content": "Timing is intimately woven into human cognition and behaviour, underscoring people's ability of comprehending speech, playing instruments and competing in sports. Converging evidence suggests that our perceptual experience of time is grounded in our ability to control actions: time processing leverages motor control neural machinery, and perceived time is significantly distorted in proximity of action. However, the dynamic interplay between timing and action systems remains unexplored, particularly in goal-directed contexts where action control is gradually refined through practice. Through combined behavioural, neural and modelling approaches, we investigate how time processing gradually evolves as participants gain experience in goal-driven manual reaching actions, varying in terms of action-plan specificity. Participants judged brief visual durations while preparing hand movements aimed at visual targets displayed on a monitor. Subjective time expanded in the foreperiod preceding action onset, and this effect increased over trials, mirroring gradual improvements in action readiness as motor plans became more rapidly and efficiently deployed. Representation Similarity Analysis, integrating electroencephalographic and behavioural data, reveals that actions shape timing through independent mechanisms: planning specific behaviours shapes how duration information is written into timekeeping neural circuits as stimuli unfold (encoding). Parallely, more general aspects of motor engagement and anticipation shape how duration information is read-out from timing circuits following stimulus presentation (decoding). These findings highlight a dynamic, learning-driven coupling between perceptual time and motor control, where subjective time is recalibrated as goal-directed action preparation is optimized, shaped through independent time encoding and decoding mechanisms.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "title": "Neuronal integrity is altered in the ipsilesional hand sensory territory in late stroke",
      "content": "Background: Sensorimotor remapping plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. While motor remapping has been intensively investigated at various levels, from functional to metabolic, limited attention has been given to somatosensory cortical remapping. This study extends our previous work showing functionally relevant metabolic alterations in radiologically normal-appearing or spared motor cortices, predominantly in the ipsilesional (stroke-injured) hemisphere, during the chronic phase of stroke. Precisely, we investigated the metabolic status of the ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relation to hand impairment in late stroke. Methods: Fourteen individuals with a chronic (mean {+/-} SD, 21.1 {+/-} 36.9 months post-onset) ischemic subcortical stroke, exhibiting moderate hand impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, 44.8 {+/-} 20.9; Jamar dynamometer, 54.1% {+/-} 40.9% of the non-paretic hand), but without sensory deficits, and ten matched healthy controls participated. MR Spectroscopy markers of neuronal status (N-acetylaspartate) and neuronal-glial glutamatergic cycle/neurotransmission (glutamate-glutamine complex) were measured in the ipsilesional S1 (3T, Allegra Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Between-group comparison of brain-tissue-corrected levels of these markers (LCModel, SPM12, MATLAB 2023a) and correlation analyses were performed (SPSS v26). Results: Compared with controls, patients showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate levels (by 14.5%, p = 0.03) but no significant alterations in glutamate-glutamine levels (by -4.0%, p = 0.6). Significant correlations were found between N-acetylaspartate and the glutamate-glutamine complex in patients (p = 0.02), but not in controls (p = 0.06). No significant correlations were found between S1 markers and hand impairment (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with lower cortical excitability in the ipsilesional S1 in chronic stroke survivors. Further work on the functional relevance of such findings, using larger sample sizes, is warranted.",

      "content": "<p>Hey all, Justin here. I previously built Phind, the AI search engine for developers.<p>One of the biggest problems we had there was figuring out what went wrong with bad searches. We had tons of searches per day, but less than 1% of users gave any explicit feedback. So we were either manually digging through searches or making general system improvements and hoping they helped.<p>This problem gets harder with agents. Traces are longer and more complex. It takes more effort to review them, so I'm building a tool that lets you analyze LLM outputs directly to help developers of LLM apps and agents understand where things are breaking and why.<p>I've put together a demo using browser-use agent traces (gpt-5): <a href=\"https://trails-red.vercel.app/viewer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://trails-red.vercel.app/viewer</a><p>It's early, but I have lots of ideas - live querying of past failures for currently-running agents, preference models to expand sparse signal data.<p>Would love feedback on the demo. Also if you're building agents and have 10k+ traces per day that you're not looking at but would like to, I'd love to talk.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46736978\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46736978</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
