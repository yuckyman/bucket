      "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, yet strategies for safe and precise mitochondrial-targeted delivery remain limited. Here, we establish strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) as a biocompatible, high-fidelity chemical platform for engineering mitochondria-targeted brain-derived exosomes (BR-EVs). Copper-free click conjugation of a mitochondrial-targeting ligand (e.g. Cy5-DBCO) under mild aqueous conditions preserved vesicle morphology (30-150 nm core; 120-200 nm hydrodynamic), proteomic composition, and uptake dynamics. Time-course imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed unaltered endocytic kinetics, >75 % mitochondrial colocalization, and intact organelle architecture. In vivo neuroinflammation and biodistribution analyses demonstrated immunological neutrality, strong central nervous system retention, and minimal peripheral dispersion following intracerebroventricular administration. Proteomic profiling of unlabeled Sprague-Dawley (SD) and hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) BR-EVs uncovered hypertension-driven enrichment of oxidative and complement pathways correlating with mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation in neuronal cultures. These findings establish SPAAC-mediated ligand conjugation as a biocompatible and chemically precise approach for generating mitochondria-targeted exosomes that preserve exosomal identity, biodistribution, and signaling fidelity-advancing a foundational platform for organelle-specific delivery and mechanistic imaging in the central nervous system.",

      "title": "Analysis of cortical dysplasias using b-tensor encoding diffusion MRI in an animal model",
      "content": "Cortical dysplasias are malformations of cortical development characterized by disorganization of the cyto- and myeloarchitecture of the neocortex. They are a common cause of epilepsy and their diagnosis through conventional imaging can often be challenging, hindering surgical treatments. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the ability to infer tissue properties at the microscopic scale, making it a promising technique for detection of cortical dysplasias. This study aims to assess the microarchitecture of the cerebral cortex in a murine model of cortical dysplasia using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired with b-tensor encoding. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either carmustine (BCNU) or saline solution on day 15 of gestation. Their offspring were imaged at 120 days of age using a 7 tesla scanner, acquiring diffusion-sensitive images with b-tensor encoding. Images were processed with Q-space trajectory imaging with positivity constraints (QTI+) to derive various metrics along a curvilinear coordinate system across the neocortex. After scanning, the brains were processed for immunofluorescence and histological examinations. Experimental animals exhibited a significant reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy ( FA) and anisotropic kurtosis (Ka) in the middle and lateral cortical layers compared to the control animals. Immunofluorescence and histological analysis showed decreased and dysorganized myelinated fibers, and an increase of glial processes in BCNU-treated animals. Given the applicability of b-tensor encoding in clinical scanners, this approach holds promise for improving detection of focal cortical dysplasias in patients with epilepsy.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Working on a new Python library called Code Spy that watches for file changes and automatically runs tasks to keep your code quality high.</p> <p>The project is not designed to replace enterprise level build / deployment CI infrastructure, it's a shortcut for developers working on solo projects that don't have the time to setup all their build tools and want a simple solution to get up &amp; running quickly! I built it for myself, for this very requirement &amp; just opened sourced it as maybe other solo devs might be interested.</p> <h1>What My Projects Does</h1> <p>The library currently supports four types of tasks, each designed to help with a specific part of the development workflow:</p> <p>Type Checking (MyPy) \u2013 Ensures your Python code has the correct type annotations and catches type-related errors early. This helps prevent subtle bugs and makes your code more maintainable.</p> <p>Linting (Pylint) \u2013 Analyzes your code for style, formatting, and potential issues according to configurable rules. It ensures consistency across your codebase and highlights areas for improvement.</p> <p>Testing (Pytest) \u2013 Automatically runs your test suite whenever code changes, helping you catch regressions quickly and maintain confidence in your code.</p> <p>Development Server (WSGI compatible apps) \u2013 Restarts your development server automatically when code changes are detected, making the feedback loop faster during development.</p> <p>Together, these tasks create a streamlined workflow that keeps code clean, correct, and ready for production with minimal manual effort.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone developing applications that want to easily check their code quality locally in a single terminal with watching / reloading functionality. This is not designed to replace your enterprise CI build pipeline in your day job.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Running any of these tasks manually in separate terminals / saving time having set all this up yourself.</p> <p>Please \u2b50\ufe0f if you find this project interesting: <a href=\"https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy\">https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joegeezer\"> /u/joegeezer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Mecp2 deficiency induces dysphagia in a preclinical model of Rett Syndrome",
      "content": "Rett Syndrome is a rare, x-linked genetic neurological disorder caused by MECP2 gene mutations. This progressive neurodevelopmental disorder hinders patients ability to breathe and eat normally. It is unclear how Mecp2-deficiency results in a high percentage of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia in patients with Rett syndrome. We aim to determine the effects of Mecp2-deficiency on swallow related neuromuscular mechanisms contributing to dysphagia in Rett syndrome. Swallow and breathing were detected using electrophysiology in the submental and laryngeal muscle complexes and the hypoglossal and vagus nerves. Several medullary motoneuron populations involved in swallowing were examined by immunohistochemistry in pre and post symptomatic Mecp2-deficient male and female mice. Swallow-related submental complex duration and amplitude were significantly decreased in both Mecp2-/y and Mecp2+/- compared to wild-type, due to decreased motor unit activation. In both Mecp2-deficient mice, cholinergic staining in hypoglossal, facial, and trigeminal nuclei were decreased. We noted a significant increase in the transition time from inspiration to swallow, swallow to the subsequent inspiration, and impaired respiratory rhythm regeneration in Mecp2-/y, but not Mecp2+/- mice. Mecp2-deficiency resulted in impaired brainstem cholinergic signaling, which contribute to weakened submental muscle complex activity, and impaired swallow related laryngeal vestibular closure. These results suggest Mecp2-deficient mice are a viable pre-clinical model to further study dysphagia in Rett syndrome.",

      "title": "MatClassRSA v2 release: A MATLAB toolbox for M/EEG classification, proximity matrix construction, and visualization",
      "content": "MatClassRSA is a MATLAB toolbox that performs magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) classification and other analyses related to Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). The toolbox is designed for cognitive neuroscience researchers who wish to perform classification-based decoding analyses of their data---often repeated trials of evoked responses---or derive Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) as input to RSA. Organized as a collection of user-called functions, MatClassRSA v2 comprises five main modules: Preprocessing, Reliability, Classification, RDM Computation, and Visualization. The Classification module supports multiple classifiers (LDA, RF, SVM) and classification schemes (e.g., multiclass, pairwise, cross-validated, train-test, hyperparameter optimization) and offers basic statistical analyses via permutation testing. Functions in other modules include, for example, trial-averaging and noise normalization; reliability estimation; non-classification RDM construction; and hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering visualizations. The toolbox is freely available on GitHub under an MIT license and includes the main codebase, a User Manual, example function calls, and illustrative analyses. This preprint provides a general background of M/EEG classification for RSA as well as a narrative overview of the v2 MatClassRSA release, its updated functionalities, and illustrative analyses performed using the toolbox.",

      "title": "GABA-glutamate corelease is a mechanism for state-dependent neurotransmission",
      "content": "Ventral tegmental area neurons projecting to lateral habenula (LHb) corelease the main inhibitory and excitatory transmitters, GABA and glutamate (VTAGG). Yet the functional role of this synchronous signal remains unclear. We hypothesized that the sign of VTAGG action depends on postsynaptic state in LHb. Ex vivo, activating VTAGG terminals evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses in LHb that varied with postsynaptic membrane potential. In vivo, VTAGG inputs drove net inhibition and supported positive reinforcement that was dependent on GABA, but not glutamate, release. Using chemogenetics to bidirectionally modulate LHb, we found that LHb hyperpolarization shifted VTAGG effects toward excitation, abolishing positive reinforcement, whereas LHb depolarization enhanced net inhibition and positive reinforcement. Thus, the activity state of LHb neurons dictates whether GABA-glutamate corelease is functionally inhibitory or excitatory and can reverse the motivational valence of VTAGG input, supporting a homeostatic role for GABA-glutamate cotransmission with broad implications for disorders of imbalanced motivation.",
