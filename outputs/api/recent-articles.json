      "title": "Scalability of random forest in myoelectric control",
      "content": "Objective. Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic (EMG) signals into control commands, enabling immersive human\u2013robot interactions in the real world and the Metaverse. The variability of EMG due to various confounding factors leads to significant performance degradation. Such variability can be mitigated by training a highly generalizable but massively parameterized deep neural network, which can be effectively scaled using a vast dataset. We aim to find an alternative simple, explainable, efficient and parallelizable model, which can flexibly scale up with a larger dataset and scale down to reduce model size, and thereby will significantly facilitate the practical implementation of myoelectric control. Approach. In this work, we discuss the scalability of a random forest (RF) for myoelectric control. We show how to scale an RF up and down during the process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and automatic self-calibration. The effects of diverse factors such as bootstrapping, decision tree editing (pre-training, pruning, grafting, appending), and the size of training data are systematically studied using EMG data from 106 participants including both low- and high-density electrodes. Main results. We examined several factors that affect the size and accuracy of the model. The best solution could reduce the size of RF models by 500\u00d7, with the accuracy reduced by only 1.5%. Importantly, for the first time we report the merit of RF that with more EMG electrodes (higher input dimension), the RF model size would be reduced. Significance. All of these findings contribute to the real time deployment RF models in real world myoelectric control applications.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Motor implementation of control and reward-based urgency regulation across impulsivity",
      "content": "Everyday decisions unfold dynamically, with commitment shaped by a growing sense of urgency that can, when excessive, contribute to impulsive choices. Here we aimed at dissociating two modes of urgency regulation, control-driven (accuracy-oriented) and reward-driven (motivation-based), and asked whether their relative influence varies across individuals differing in impulsivity. We further investigated how these regulatory modes are implemented in the motor system, focusing on two modulatory effects: surround inhibition and broad modulation. Healthy participants, whose impulsivity was assessed with the UPPS urgency dimension, performed a modified Tokens task crossing control demands (low vs high control blocks) with motivational context (low vs high reward trials). In two separate sessions, single-pulse TMS was applied either over the hand motor representation to probe corticospinal excitability indexing surround inhibition, or over the leg representation to index broad modulations of motor activity. This design successfully dissociated the two regulatory modes: control-driven adjustments (across blocks) were most evident in less impulsive participants, whereas reward-driven adjustments (across trials) were most evident in more impulsive participants. Consistent with this dissociation, control-driven urgency regulation was associated with broad modulation of motor activity, whereas reward-driven urgency adjustments were associated with changes in surround inhibition. These motor signatures may serve as probes of the respective contributions of control- and reward-driven regulation even when they are not explicitly dissociated. Our findings suggest that impulsivity may not simply reflect 'more urgency' but a different weighting of the influences that shape it during decision making, a hypothesis that can now be tested in clinical conditions.",
