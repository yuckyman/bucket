      "title": "Neural flexibility in metabolic demand dynamics reveals sex-specific differences and supports cognition in late childhood",
      "content": "Dynamic coordination of metabolic demand across brain networks supports emerging cognitive abilities and may drive overall cognitive development, yet how these dynamics vary by sex and relate to cognition in late childhood remains unclear. Using resting-state fMRI from 2,000 healthy 9- to 11-year-olds in the ABCD study, we applied time-resolved dynamic time warping to quantify amplitude mismatches, a proxy of relative energy demand across brain intrinsic networks. Clustering revealed three recurring states: convergent (globally balanced), divergent (imbalanced), and mixed (intermediate). Females spent engaged more with the flexible mixed state, whereas males lingered longer in convergent and divergent states. Across the cohort, better performance on cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and long-term memory tasks correlated with greater overall time in the mixed state and with higher transition rates, but with shorter dwell in any single state. These findings indicate that neural flexibility, rather than prolonged stability, supports cognition during late childhood and that sex differences in dynamic energy coordination emerge well before adolescence.",

      "title": "Discrete interneuron subsets participate in GluN1/GluN3A excitatory glycine receptor (eGlyR)-mediated regulation of hippocampal network activity throughout development and evolution.",
      "content": "Decades of studies implicating GluN3A N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits in physiological and pathological function have largely been interpreted through direct regulation of conventional glutamatergic NMDARs. However, emerging evidence indicates that GluN3A frequently assembles with GluN1 forming unconventional glutamate-insensitive NMDARs that operate as native excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs). Here we demonstrate that hippocampal somatostatin and neurogliaform interneurons (Sst-INs and NGFCs) express functional eGlyRs from early postnatal through adult ages. In the developing hippocampus eGlyR-mediated excitation of NGFCs with ambient glycine dramatically increases GABAergic tone, with consequences for the generation of giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). In the mature hippocampus, eGlyR-mediated excitation of Sst-INs regulates sharp wave ripples (SWRs). Finally, we reveal evolutionary conservation of hippocampal Sst-IN eGlyRs and eGlyR-mediated SWR regulation in non-human primates confirming functional eGlyR availability for therapeutic potential in higher species. Our findings underscore that eGlyR mediated regulation of cell and circuit excitability through both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms must be considered to understand GluN3A roles in brain development, plasticity, and disease.",

      "title": "Targeting Amygdala-Brainstem Synapses to Reverse Prepulse Inhibition Deficits",
      "content": "Sensorimotor gating, a fundamental pre-attentive process, can be assessed using the acoustic pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) assay. PPI deficits are a hallmark endophenotype of schizophrenia and are observed across various neuropsychiatric disorders, often predicting symptoms such as attention impairments, psychosis, and other cognitive/motor dysfunctions. Reversal of PPI deficits is routinely tested in disease models as a preclinical trial for antipsychotic drug screening. However, the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying PPI deficits remain unclear, limiting therapeutic progress. We recently identified an uncharted pathway in mice, by which glutamatergic neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) activate glycinergic neurons in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC), contributing to PPI regulation. Given the prevalence of amygdala dysfunction in disorders associated with PPI deficits, CeA-PnC glutamatergic synapses represent a novel therapeutic target. Here, using \"Cal-Light,\" an in vivo Ca2+-dependent photo-tagging approach, we precisely identified CeA and PnC neurons active during acoustic startle and PPI with high spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we used mice carrying homozygous deficiency in PRODH, a schizophrenia-relevant gene encoding proline dehydrogenase and modulating PPI. While Prodh-/- mice showed aberrant CeA neuronal properties and reduced PPI levels, we re-stored PPI by photo-activating CeA-PnC glutamatergic synapses, underscoring their involvement in pathological states. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the amygdala-brainstem circuitry that underlies PPI deficits, offering new potential for therapeutic interventions.",

      "title": "Cooperative behavior guided by peer coordination is impaired in a Fragile-X rat model of autism",
      "content": "Cooperative behavior, the ability of individuals to coordinate their actions toward shared goals, is fundamental to survival and social success across species. However, the behavioral mechanisms that support cooperation, and how their disruption leads to social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), remain poorly understood. To address these questions, we developed a cooperation task in paired spatial mazes in dyads of wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1) rats, a model of Fragile X syndrome, under deterministic (100%) and probabilistic (50%) reward contingencies. Both WT and Fmr1 rat pairs exhibited mixed leader-follower strategies to coordinate their actions for cooperation, however WT pairs achieved significantly greater cooperation success than Fmr1 pairs. WT and Fmr1 pairs both displayed a follower-tracking-leader strategy during transitions between reward wells, which required partner-directed visual attention, followed by a reactive action to match leader position, with Fmr1 pairs reliant on this strategy to a greater degree. In WT rats, more efficient cooperation was based on a flexible predictive strategy leading to coordination of optimal choice patterns between rat pairs and sensitivity to recent partner choices, whereas Fmr1 rats were significantly weaker in these strategies leading to deficits in adaptive behavior. These findings identify key behavioral strategies for cooperation, reveal their disruption in a rat model of ASD, and provide a framework for linking social cue usage to flexible and strategic cooperative decision-making with relevance to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",
