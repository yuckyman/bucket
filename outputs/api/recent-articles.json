      "content": "arXiv:2510.10173v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces Chord Colourizer, a near real-time system that detects the musical key of an audio signal and visually represents it through a novel graphical user interface (GUI). The system assigns colours to musical notes based on Isaac Newton's original colour wheel, preserving historical links between pitch and hue, and also integrates an Arduino-controlled LED display using 3D-printed star-shaped diffusers to offer a physical ambient media representation. The method employs Constant-Q Transform (CQT) chroma features for chord estimation and visualization, followed by threshold-based filtering and tonal enhancement to isolate the root, third, and fifth. A confidence score is computed for each detection to ensure reliability, and only chords with moderate to very strong certainty are visualized. The graphical interface dynamically updates a colour-coded keyboard layout, while the LED display provides the same colour information via spatial feedback. This multi-modal system enhances user interaction with harmonic content, offering innovative possibilities for education and artistic performance. Limitations include slight latency and the inability to detect extended chords, which future development will aim to address through refined filtering, adaptive thresholds, and support for more complex harmonies such as sevenths and augmented chords. Future work will also explore integration with alternative visualization styles, and the comparison of audio analysis libraries to improve detection speed and precision. Plans also include formal user testing to evaluate perception, usability, and cross-cultural interpretations of colour-pitch mappings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.10079v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health, personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants' responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.10049v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration (PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents. ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the traditional prompt-based approach.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.10048v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly adopted by patients seeking everyday health guidance, yet their reliability and clinical appropriateness remain uncertain. Taking Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as a representative chronic condition, this paper presents a two-part mixed-methods study that examines how patients and physicians in China evaluate the quality and usability of AI-generated health information. Study~1 analyzes 784 authentic patient questions to identify seven core categories of informational needs and five evaluation dimensions -- \\textit{Accuracy, Safety, Clarity, Integrity}, and \\textit{Action Orientation}. Study~2 involves seven endocrinologists who assess responses from four mainstream AI models across these dimensions. Quantitative and qualitative findings reveal consistent strengths in factual and lifestyle guidance but significant weaknesses in medication interpretation, contextual reasoning, and empathy. Patients view AI as an accessible ``pre-visit educator,'' whereas clinicians highlight its lack of clinical safety and personalization. Together, the findings inform design implications for interactive health systems, advocating for multi-model orchestration, risk-aware fallback mechanisms, and emotionally attuned communication to ensure trustworthy AI assistance in chronic disease care.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.10019v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dental anxiety is prevalent among children, often leading to missed treatment and potential negative effects on their mental well-being. While several interventions (e.g., pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques) have been introduced for anxiety alleviation, the recently emerged virtual reality (VR) technology, with its immersive and playful nature, opened new opportunities for complementing and enhancing the therapeutic effects of existing interventions. In this light, we conducted a series of co-design workshops with 13 children aged 10-12 to explore how they envisioned using VR to address their fear and stress associated with dental visits, followed by interviews with parents (n = 13) and two dentists. Our findings revealed that children expected VR to provide immediate relief, social support, and a sense of control during dental treatment, parents sought educational opportunities for their children to learn about oral health, and dentists prioritized treatment efficiency and safety issues. Drawing from the findings, we discuss the considerations of multi-stakeholders for developing VR-assisted anxiety management applications for children within and beyond dental settings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.09944v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) has traditionally examined how humans rely on one another cognitively and socially to accomplish tasks together. With the rapid advancement of AI and large language models, however, a new question emerge: what happens to team dynamics when one of the \"teammates\" is not human? In this study, we investigate how the integration of an AI teammate -- a fully autonomous GPT-4 agent with social, cognitive, and affective capabilities -- shapes the socio-cognitive dynamics of CPS. We analyze discourse data collected from human-AI teaming (HAT) experiments conducted on a novel platform specifically designed for HAT research. Using two natural language processing (NLP) methods, specifically Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Group Communication Analysis (GCA), we found that AI teammates often assumed the role of dominant cognitive facilitators, guiding, planning, and driving group decision-making. However, they did so in a socially detached manner, frequently pushing agenda in a verbose and repetitive way. By contrast, humans working with AI used more language reflecting social processes, suggesting that they assumed more socially oriented roles. Our study highlights how learning analytics can provide critical insights into the socio-cognitive dynamics of human-AI collaboration.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.09874v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025, visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model), which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936. Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115 introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated in a playful way to a general audience.",

Although termed differently, these methods share common concepts and methods, suggesting unification under what-if analysis. Yet a unified framework to define motivations, core components, and its distinct types is lacking. To address this gap, we reviewed 141 publications from leading visual analytics and HCI venues (2014-2024). Our analysis (1) outlines the motivations for what-if analysis, (2) introduces Praxa, a structured framework that identifies its fundamental components and characterizes its distinct types, and (3) highlights challenges associated with the application and implementation. Together, our findings establish a standardized vocabulary and structural understanding, enabling more consistent use across domains and communicate with greater conceptual clarity. Finally, we identify open research problems and future directions to advance what-if analysis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.09763v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-driven applications have become woven into students' academic and creative workflows, influencing how they learn, write, and produce ideas. Gaining a nuanced understanding of these usage patterns is essential, yet conventional survey and interview methods remain limited by recall bias, self-presentation effects, and the underreporting of habitual behaviors. While ethnographic methods offer richer contextual insights, they often face challenges of scale and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we introduce a privacy-conscious approach that repurposes VPN-based network traffic analysis as a scalable ethnographic technique for examining students' real-world engagement with AI tools. By capturing anonymized metadata rather than content, this method enables fine-grained behavioral tracing while safeguarding personal information, thereby complementing self-report data. A three-week field deployment with university students reveals fragmented, short-duration interactions across multiple tools and devices, with intense bursts of activity coinciding with exam periods-patterns mirroring institutional rhythms of academic life. We conclude by discussing methodological, ethical, and empirical implications, positioning network traffic analysis as a promising avenue for large-scale digital ethnography on technology-in-practice.",

      "title": "People use fast, flat goal-directed simulation to reason about novel problems",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.11503v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive Gamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited) goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000 participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no experience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at all.",

      "title": "Refining RDoC Using Individual-Level Task fMRI Factor Models Reveals Reproducible Brain-wide Motifs",
      "content": "The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework was introduced to guide psychiatric research using biologically grounded, dimensional constructs of mental function. However, its current hierarchical domain structure remains largely unvalidated against individual-level brain imaging data. Building on our prior group-level work showing that data-driven bifactor models outperform RDoC-based models, we applied a multi-stage validation framework to Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data to test whether individual-level, empirically derived models more accurately reflect the intrinsic organization and behavioral relevance of brain activity. Using confirmatory factor analysis in two independent cohorts, we found that individual-level, data-driven bifactor models consistently outperformed RDoC-based models across multiple fit indices in both training and validation sets. The general factor derived from these models revealed a reproducible macroscale gradient spanning visual-attentional to auditory-default mode networks, aligning with canonical resting-state gradients and supporting its interpretation as a domain-general axis of large-scale brain organization. Applying community detection to subject-specific factor representations revealed four spatial motifs whose centroids corresponded to interpretable brain systems and were robustly reproduced across cohorts. Similarity to these centroids predicted individual task performance in working memory and relational reasoning, as measured by both raw accuracy and latent performance factors. To further assess organizational validity, we applied Mapper-a topological data analysis method-to contrast maps, generating unsupervised graph representations of task-evoked brain activity. Mapper graphs annotated with data-driven centroids showed greater modularity than those annotated with RDoC domains, suggesting that the data-driven framework better captures the topological structure of individual functional brain states. Together, these findings demonstrate that individual-level, data-driven factor models provide a more accurate, interpretable, and behaviorally relevant account of brain organization than the current RDoC framework. By modeling inter-individual variability directly from neuroimaging data, this approach advances precision neuroscience and supports the empirical refinement of dimensional psychiatric frameworks such as RDoC.",

      "title": "Mesoscale developmental rivalry in human extrastriate visual cortex",
      "content": "In humans and non-human primates, the extrastriate visual cortex contains fine-scale columns selectively responsive to motion, disparity, and color. However, the developmental interplay between these functional modules remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we compared the mesoscale organization of extrastriate cortex in 16 individuals with normal vision and 15 participants with amblyopia (PwA) caused by strabismus (n=8) or anisometropia (n=7). In controls, the cortical territory occupied by disparity-selective columns exhibited a competitive relationship with that of motion- and color-selective columns. Consistent with this pattern, PwA showed a reduction in disparity-selective responses accompanied by enhanced motion- and color-selective activity, as well as expansion of the cortical territory allocated to them. Our results show that the mesoscale modules of the human visual system are rivals in development allowing intact functions to usurp those that are compromised.",

      "title": "Age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking",
      "content": "Walking on uneven terrain becomes more difficult as we age, and gait becomes less automatic. Using mobile brain imaging via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the neural mechanisms contributing to reduced mobility capability with aging. The objective of this study was to quantify age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking, both averaged across many strides and variations within a stride. We included 31 young adults and 71 older adults for analysis. All participants walked on an uneven terrain treadmill with four levels of terrain difficulty at their self-selected speed. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater increase in step duration variability and mediolateral sacral excursion variability as the terrain became more uneven. We identified multiple brain regions involved during walking on uneven terrain. Regardless of age group, walking on uneven terrain compared to flat terrain led to a widespread change of electrocortical dynamics in the brain, especially in the alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) band power. In the parieto-occipital region, younger adults experienced a greater reduction in alpha and beta power with increasing terrain unevenness compared to older adults. We also assessed how intra-stride power fluctuations changed with terrain unevenness and age group. Greater intra-stride power spectral fluctuations in the occipital area were associated with greater terrain unevenness for younger adults, but not for older adults. In summary, older adults showed a greater increase in gait variability than younger adults as the terrain became more uneven, but exhibited a lack of modulation of parieto-occipital activity in response to terrain unevenness. The lack of task-related power modulation may suggest reduced cortical network flexibility in older adults. The absence of increased parieto-occipital activity when walking on uneven versus flat surfaces in older adults may also indicate that, unlike younger adults, older adults already heavily rely on visual processes during flat surface walking and may therefore have reduced occipital modulation range remaining to cope with the visuomotor processing demands of walking on uneven surfaces.",

      "title": "Peripheral Inflammation Limits Serotonin Neuron Signaling Capacity via Serotonergic IL-1R1 to Reduce Neuronal Excitability and Enhance Serotonin Clearance",
      "content": "Neurobehavioral disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, have been found to display immune system alterations. The high incidence of comorbidity of these disorders, particularly depression, with chronic inflammatory conditions suggests shared mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of these conditions. We have previously shown that peripheral modulation of the innate immune system in mice rapidly triggers enhanced serotonin (5-HT) clearance in vivo associated with increased anxiety- and despair-like behaviors that can be suppressed by serotonergic elimination of p38 MAPK. Forebrain-projecting 5-HT synthesizing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) play a key role in regulating behaviors related to mood and anxiety and whose perturbations are observed in multiple affective disorders. Here we identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that can translate peripheral innate immune system activation into changes in 5-HT signaling capacity. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings from acute midbrain slices, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1{beta}, acts cell autonomously through its receptor, IL-1R1, via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to rapidly inhibit firing of DRN5-HT neurons. In the dorsal hippocampus, we found that as with acute, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, local injections of IL-1{beta} rapidly enhance 5-HT clearance as assessed by in vivo chronoamperometry. Like IL-1{beta}, TNF also acts via a serotonergic p38 MAPK dependent pathway to reduce excitability of DRN5-HT neurons. Immunocytochemical studies reveal that, IL-1R1, is nonuniformly expressed by DRN5-HT neurons and is required for LPS-induced inhibition of these cells as detected by cFos activation, with sex-dependent patterns evident. Moreover, we detected both DRN5-HT IL-1R1-dependent and -independent LPS-mediated changes in cFos changes in forbrain projection areas. Our findings support a growing appreciation that serotoninergic neurons contribute to changes in CNS physiology and behavior following peripheral immune activation. More specifically, our studies attest to a functional role of serotonergic IL-1R1 in mediating IL-1{beta} following peripheral innate immune activation, effects likely to arise both from changes in diminished 5-HT neuron excitability and elevated 5-HT clearance.",
