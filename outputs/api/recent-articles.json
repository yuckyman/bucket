      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Environmental factors contribute to cancer therapy toxicity",
      "content": "Cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects numerous cancer patients, however there is substantial variability in its severity. Here, we investigated how environmental factors such as housing facility and time of treatment, known as chronotherapy, impact chemotoxicity in a pediatric murine model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced CRCI. We find that MTX consistently impacts body mass in a time-of-day specific manner across different housing facilities. Intriguingly, investigation of the gut microbiome acutely after MTX chronotherapy revealed substantial differences in microbial composition between animals housed in different facilities as well as decreased microbial diversity at different times of day. Furthermore, these differences in the gut microbiome after MTX chronotherapy coincide with differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine profiles between facilities and times of day. Chronically, housing facility continued to impact serum cytokine levels after MTX treatment, whereas the effect of time wanes. Nonetheless, we found that time drastically alters chronic white matter microglial gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) after MTX treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate that both housing facility and time dictate response to MTX chronotherapy in the periphery and CNS. Collectively, this work elucidates putative factors that can regulate MTX-induced chemotoxicity.",
