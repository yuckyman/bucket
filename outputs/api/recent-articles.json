      "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
      "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

      "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

      "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "title": "Refinement of locomotor activity is developmentally regulated by dopaminergic signaling in larval zebrafish",
      "content": "The refinement of gross motor skills, such as locomotion, during development is conserved across vertebrate species. Our previous work demonstrated, in larval zebrafish, that dopaminergic signaling through the dopamine D2-like family of receptors, specifically the dopamine 4 receptor subtype, was necessary for the developmental transformation of behaviorally relevant locomotor activity from an immature to a mature pattern between 3- and 4-days post-fertilization. In this study, we used a complement of tools, including electrophysiology, pharmacology, in vivo calcium imaging, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to characterize the functional and molecular mechanisms responsible for this dopaminergic-mediated refinement of spinal locomotor activity. The results demonstrate that the dopamine 4 receptor subtype is both present and functional in, at least, a subset of immature larvae. Further, gene expression of all D2-like receptor subtypes, levels of dopamine, and activity of diencephalic dopaminergic neurons are significantly greater in mature larvae compared to immature larvae. The integration of these results provides evidence for the developmental role of dopaminergic signaling, specifically the dopamine receptor 4 subtype, in the refinement of locomotor activity in vertebrates.",

      "title": "Self-esteem modulates beneficial causal attributions in the formation of novel self-beliefs",
      "content": "Healthy individuals typically attribute successes to internal causes, such as their abilities, and failures to external factors, like bad luck. In contrast, individuals with depression and low self-esteem are more likely to attribute failures to internal causes and successes to external causes. At the same time, depression and low self-esteem are associated with negatively biased self-related learning and self-beliefs. Although causal attributions have been shown to influence belief formation and updating, the dynamic interaction between real-time attributions and self-related learning remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions. These findings provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that may contribute to the development and maintenance of negative self-beliefs commonly observed in depression.",

      "content": "Approximately 97% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of the ubiquitous nuclear protein, TDP-43. Current rodent models of this disease fail to replicate the progressive motor weakness and characteristic histopathology, possibly because of fundamental neuroanatomical and genetic differences between rodents and humans. In this study, the TDP-43 protein was overexpressed in the motor neuron pool of the brachioradialis muscle unilaterally in two six-year-old female rhesus macaques, using an intersectional genetics approach involving infection with genetically modified adeno-associated virus. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated delayed signal hyperintensities limited to the injected brachioradialis that persisted for 6-7 weeks, consistent with motor neuron degeneration and denervation of the targeted muscle. At post-mortem, the virus-mediated focal protein overexpression event was found to induce widespread deposits of pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 throughout the cervical spinal cord and motor cortex bilaterally, indicating an ALS-like spread of proteinopathy from the transfection site.",

      "title": "Cortical neuroprostheses improve auditory coding and perception compared to cochlear implants",
      "content": "Cochlear implants have transformed the treatment of hearing loss by enabling auditory perception through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, their effectiveness can be limited in noisy environments, for fine frequency resolution, and in patients lacking an intact auditory nerve. The auditory cortex offers a promising alternative target for neuroprosthetic stimulation, but it remains unclear whether direct cortical input can evoke percepts with the complexity and structure of natural sounds. Here we show that surface cortical implants in mice support robust and flexible auditory behaviour, surpassing cochlear implants in tasks requiring fine spectral, temporal, and noise-resistant discrimination. We also show that animals generalize seamlessly between cortical and acoustic stimuli without additional training, indicating that cortical stimulation can generate interpretable, sound-like percepts. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that cortical stimulation drives spatially and temporally structured neural activity in auditory cortex, resembling responses to natural sound. These findings establish that the auditory cortex can interpret spatially and temporally patterned electrical input in a behavioural relevant way. By linking neuroprosthetic stimulation to naturalistic neural representations and behavioural generalization, this work provides a mechanistic and functional foundation for cortical auditory neuroprostheses and points toward new strategies for restoring hearing through direct brain stimulation.",

      "title": "Mediodorsal Thalamic Input to Striatum Contributes to Early Action Learning",
      "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",
