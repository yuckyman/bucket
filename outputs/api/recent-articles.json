      "title": "Optimized reference region and the effect on test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease with UCB-J.",
      "content": "[11C]UCB-J is a radioligand targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, used to image synaptic density. For quantification, a small-volume centrum semiovale area was previously optimized as a [11C]UCB-J reference region (CS2mL); however, its high variability resulted in reduced reliability. Herin, we evaluated an alternative reference region method to assess longitudinal test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). For estimating distribution volume ratio (DVR), CS2mL and eleven white matter (WM) reference regions (range: 0.5-200 mL) were generated using the Freesurfer WM map. Same-day and longitudinal test-retest variability (TRV) were assessed (24 healthy subjects (HS); n=10 same-day and n=20 longitudinal HRRT scans, range: 7-1028 days). Each reference region was used to evaluate the substantia nigra (SN) and caudate DVRs in HS (n=25) and PD (n=20). The 10mL WM reference region yielded [11C]UCB-J DVR measurements with reduced variability in TRV (same-day: 10mL: 1.2{+/-}5.7%, same-day: CS2mL: -0.9{+/-}9.2% longitudinal: 10mL: 1.5{+/-}7.0%, CS2mL: 1.6{+/-}11.9%,) while maintaining less than 10% volume of distribution difference, compared to CS2mL. Further, a significant difference between PD and HS groups in SN and caudate DVRs was found using 10mL, with greater effect size (Cohen's d 0.61 for SN and 0.66 for caudate) compared to CS2mL (0.38 for SN and 0.43 for caudate).",

      "title": "Ascending propriospinal modulation of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons during lumbar locomotor activity",
      "content": "Although the autonomic sympathetic system is activated in parallel with locomotion, the underlying neural mechanisms mediating this coordination are not completely understood. Descending exercise or central command signals from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are thought to activate thoracic spinal sympathetic neurons in parallel with descending locomotor commands. In turn, subsets of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) then increase activation of a constellation of tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. It is known that neurons within the spinal cord (propriospinal networks) can generate well-coordinated and sustained locomotor activity but whether these propriospinal networks contribute to coordination between locomotor and autonomic systems is unknown. To investigate this, we applied neurochemicals to elicit whole-cord or lumbar-evoked locomotor activity in an in vitro spinal cord preparation, simultaneously recording lumbar ventral root (VR) activity and changes in calcium fluorescence of pre-labelled SPNs in thoracic segments. Using whole-bath drug application to elicit hindlimb locomotor activity, recorded SPN responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) compared to caudal (T8 to T11) segments. When locomotor-inducing neurochemicals were applied only to the lumbar region using a split-bath configuration, SPN population responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) but not caudal (T8 to T9) segments during both tonic and rhythmic VR activity. In both approaches, the greatest numbers of SPNs with increased fluorescence during rhythmic activity were in T6/7, whereas the greatest numbers with unchanged or decreased fluorescence were in caudal segments (T8 to T11). Together these findings reveal a strong ascending lumbar to thoracic integrating communication pathway and may represent a key feature of spinal neural network function normally. Such communication pathways should be further investigated for targeted autonomic function(s) activation and therapeutic benefit after spinal cord injury.",

      "content": "Loneliness is globally acknowledged as a severe and burgeoning health risk, fuelling interest in helping people of all ages form meaningful social connections. One promising approach consists of intergenerational social programs. While behavioural and qualitative evidence derived from such programs promise health and wellbeing benefits, the physiological consequences of repeated intergenerational encounters remain unknown. Insight into physiological changes will shed light on the mechanisms of social connection and inform program design choices. We charted changes in interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in 31 intergenerational (older/younger adult) and 30 same generation (younger adult) dyads across a six-session art program. At each session, dyads completed self-report measures, drew together and alone, and had their cortical activation recorded with fNIRS. In both groups, INS was greater while dyads drew together than alone. Across sessions, intergenerational dyads' INS decreased and same generation dyads' INS increased. Further findings highlight the promise of INS as a biomarker for changes in loneliness and the development of social relationships.",

      "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

      "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
      "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

      "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
      "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

      "title": "Metallothionein III Mediates Ca2+-Dependent Zn2+ Spikes to Inhibit Dendritic Arborization",
      "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Vocal communication is a complex social behavior that entails the integration of auditory perception and vocal production. Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

      "title": "Layer 6 Corticothalamic Neurons Induce High Gamma Oscillations Through Cortico-cortical and Cortico-thalamo-cortical Pathways",
      "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",

      "title": "ATAD1 Overexpression Enhances Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Function in Zellweger Syndrome Disorder Models",
      "content": "Zellweger Spectrum Disorders (ZSDs) are caused by mutations in any of the different peroxin (PEX) genes, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis and function. Clinical features of ZSDs include seizures, leukodystrophy, renal and liver dysfunction, skeletal abnormalities, and they usually result in death during infancy or early childhood. There are no treatments for ZSDs, and their rarity, the large size of the PEX genes, and the numerous different genes, has impaired therapeutic development. We previously demonstrated that ATAD1, a mitochondrial protein quality control chaperone, could correct both mitochondrial and peroxisomal phenotypes in PEX3 patient fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated whether overexpressing ATAD1 could provide similar benefits in PEX1 and PEX6 patient cell lines, which account for over 70% of ZSD cases. We used established PEX6-/- HEK293 cells, patient-derived fibroblasts with pathogenic PEX1 mutations, and newly created zebrafish mutants. Lipidomic profiling of the cell lines demonstrated widespread dysregulation, including accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholines with very-long-chain fatty acids, depletion of plasmalogens and cholesteryl esters containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in cardiolipins. Overexpressing ATAD1 partly corrected these imbalances, including normalizing VLCFA metabolism in PEX1 fibroblasts and restoring plasmalogens and cardiolipins in PEX6-deficient cells. Mitochondrial function analysis (Seahorse XF) showed that ATAD1 increased basal and ATP-linked respiration in both PEX1- and PEX6-deficient cells, sometimes surpassing the effects of PEX gene re-expression. ATAD1 increased peroxisome numbers in both PEX6 and PEX1 cells. Zebrafish Pex1 mutants exhibited impaired maximal respiration despite normal basal activity, confirming mitochondrial vulnerability in vivo. These findings further confirm a role for ATAD1 as a modifier that improves lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and peroxisome abundance that could function across multiple ZSDs.",
