      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "High frequency oscillations measured with optically pumped magnetometers from the human retina",
      "content": "Measurement of human neural activity with optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) is rapidly proliferating, with sensitivity approaching that of cryogenic sensors. Most neuroscience research with OPMs to date has investigated neural responses below 70 Hz, but higher frequencies are also of interest. However, sensitivity to higher frequencies may be limited by both the inherent operating bandwidth of the current generation of zero-field OPMs as well as by their generally lower amplitude. To assess the upper bounds of OPM sensitivity we used the stereotypical retinal response to flashes of light. Retinal responses to light flashes characteristically exhibit a neural response above 70 Hz called the oscillatory potential (OP) when recorded with electroretinography (ERG). Here we adopt the term retinal high frequency oscillation (rHFO) to include measurement of similar activity with OPMs. Our comparison of magnetoretinography (MRG) and ERG shows that rHFO can be measured up to 140 Hz using rubidium-based zero-field OPMs.",

      "content": "skiftiTools processes three- and four-dimensional neuroimaging data, facilitating advanced statistical modelling with voxelwise data in any software of choice. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) is a conventionally used tool to make statistical calculations in voxel space for brain imaging data. While pre-existing software packages provide support for general linear model based statistics, there is a clear need for more sophisticated modeling. skiftiTools writes subject-per-volume NIfTI files as tab-separated value ASCII files, which are easily readable by most commonly used statistical tools such as R language (RStudio), SPSS, SAS, and GraphPad Prism. This facilitates a wide range of voxel-level statistical analyses from TBSS data, including estimation of standardised effect sizes, clustering, dimensionality reduction, non-linear and machine learning predictive modelling, which we showcase in this article using FinnBrain and developing Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI data. After statistical processing, the resulting ASCII data can then be read again for visualization. The package supports NIfTI image format, tab-separated ASCII format, and its own stand-alone format for efficient disk usage. It is open source (https://github.com/haanme/skiftiTools), built on R-language and has easy installation from CRAN package repository. In addition, we provide basic functions available in Docker containers for further platform independence.",

      "content": "Few studies have explored noninvasive biomarkers of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder (RBD), a prodromal stage for these conditions. Human oral/salivary microbiomes are altered in PD, highlighting their potential role in both PD pathogenesis and diagnosis. We analyzed 249 salivary microbiomes of controls and patients with idiopathic RBD and various synucleinopathies, including two subgroups divided based on the presence of RBD symptoms, through both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The microbiome composition was strikingly similar between patients with RBD and early PD exhibiting RBD symptoms. The area under the curve range for distinguishing RBD from controls and each synucleinopathy was 0.85-0.94. We further performed pseudotime trajectory analysis of the microbiome compositional space; populations with low diversity, enriched Streptococcus, and depleted Neisseria exhibited a brief pseudotime transition from RBD to early PD. Our findings suggest that early PD-like salivary dysbiosis manifests during RBD, allowing for the stratification of synucleinopathies through the innovative use of salivary microbiome profiles.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1. We also find that the understanding of \u201cheritage language\u201d needs to be more nuanced in this particular context of multilingualism and language acquisition.",

      "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
      "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

      "content": "Objective. Precise electrophysiological recordings and stimulation of deep brain structures in large animal models such as non-human primates require highly accurate targeting methods that are currently lacking. Approach. To address this limitation, we have integrated advanced multi-camera neuronavigation, high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography), and tailored surgical methods to chronically implant electrodes in deep structures of the macaque brain, with an accuracy below or at the millimeter scale. Main results. We first illustrate the advantage of multi-camera neuronavigation over traditional two-camera systems in 3D-printed head models, demonstrating that a submillimeter accuracy requires at least five cameras. We then introduce a detailed experimental protocol using skull-based registration for reaching submillimeter accuracies in vivo. This protocol was optimized and tested in three macaque monkeys across seven implantations targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, including five performed with skull-based registration. Next, we quantify our targeting accuracy for these two structures by in vivo neuroimaging and histological analyses. We show that our skull-based registration procedure enabled to target the entorhinal cortex with submillimetric accuracy (0.55 mm and 0.89 mm in two animals), while implantation errors for the hippocampus were slightly higher (1.11 mm and 1.68 mm in two animals). Finally, we validate our approach with electrophysiological recordings of these targeted structures during drowsiness and stimulation-induced epileptiform afterdischarges in two chronically implanted animals. Significance. This technological and surgical framework provides a means to record and stimulate deep brain structures in large animal models with submillimetric to millimetric accuracy.",

      "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its scalable architecture and model integration capabilities support a range of applications in biomarker discovery, epilepsy diagnostics, and clinical decision support, bridging advanced computation and practical usability.",

      "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
      "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.
