      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.05325v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to match brain activities during a range of cognitive tasks. Our findings demonstrate that even basic linear machine learning models can effectively classify brain states and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly for tasks related to motor functions and language processing. Feature importance ranking allows to identify distinct sets of brain regions whose activation patterns are uniquely associated with specific cognitive functions. These discriminative features provide strong support for the hypothesis of functional specialization across cortical and subcortical areas of the human brain.\n  Additionally, we investigate the temporal dynamics of the identified brain regions, demonstrating that the time-dependent structure of fMRI signals are essential for shaping functional connectivity between regions: uncorrelated areas are least important for classification. This temporal perspective provides deeper insights into the formation and modulation of brain neural networks involved in cognitive processing.",
