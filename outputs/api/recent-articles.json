      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

I\u2019ve been working on a passion project that turned into a full-stack anime ecosystem \u2014 and I wanted to share it with you all. It includes:</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 1) HiAnime API \u2014 A powerful REST API for anime data</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/Hianime_API\">https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/Hianime_API</a></p> <p>This API scrapes and aggregates data from <a href=\"http://HiAnime.to\">HiAnime.to</a> and integrates with MyAnimeList (MAL) so you can search, browse, get episode lists, streaming URLs, and even proxy HLS streams for mobile playback. It\u2019s built in Python with FastAPI and has documentation and proxy support tailored for mobile clients. \ufffc</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 2) MCP Anime Server \u2014 Anime discovery through MCP (Model Context Protocol)</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/MCP_Anime\">https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/MCP_Anime</a></p> <p>I wrapped the anime data into an MCP server with ~26 tools like search_anime, get_popular_anime, get_anime_details, MAL rankings, seasonal fetch, filtering by genre/type \u2014 basically a full featured anime backend that works with any MCP-compatible client (e.g., Claude Desktop). \ufffc</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 3) OtakuHub Flutter App \u2014 A complete Flutter mobile app</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/OtakuHub_App\">https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/OtakuHub_App</a></p> <p>On top of the backend projects, I built a Flutter app that consumes the API and delivers the anime experience natively on mobile.

      "title": "Chronic Circadian Disturbance Reshapes Hippocampal Connectivity and Cognitive Function",
      "content": "Circadian rhythms regulate a wide range of physiological and cognitive functions, yet the neural mechanisms linking circadian timing to memory remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a direct anatomical projection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the dorsal hippocampus using complementary viral anterograde, retrograde, and monosynaptic tracing approaches, alongside established indirect pathways via septal and neuromodulatory regions. These findings revise prevailing models that restrict SCN influence on hippocampal function to polysynaptic routes. Functionally, chronic circadian disruption (CCD) induced region-specific metabolic alterations and widespread reorganization of brain-wide functional connectivity (FC). Hypometabolism emerged in the SCN, dentate gyrus, and perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, accompanied by loss of SCN-hippocampal connectivity and compensatory engagement of cortical and subcortical networks. In contrast, the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus showed selective hypermetabolism and increased connectivity with the SCN, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, suggesting altered neuromodulatory control under circadian misalignment. Behaviorally, CCD produced a selective impairment in object recognition memory, while spatial memory, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse remained intact. Disrupted functional coupling within perirhinal-entorhinal-hippocampal and prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, together with altered SCN-medial septum-hippocampus connectivity, indicates that cognitive dysfunction arises from desynchronization of distributed brain networks rather than local synaptic failure. Together, these findings provide a new mechanistic framework linking circadian disruption to selective memory impairment and highlight network-level synchrony as a potential target for chronotherapeutic intervention.",

      "title": "BDH1-Dependent Ketone Body Metabolism Maintains Muller Cell Homeostasis and Retinal Function",
      "content": "Ketone body metabolism serves as an auxiliary regulator of cellular energetics and redox balance, particularly during prolonged fasting and carbohydrate restriction, yet its role in retinal homeostasis under physiological conditions remains poorly defined. {beta}-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that interconverts acetoacetate and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, and is required for efficient ketone utilization. Here, we investigated the impact of impaired endogenous ketone metabolism on retinal function using global and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)--specific BDH1 knockout (KO) mice. Global BDH1 KO mice showed reduced circulating {beta}-hydroxybutyrate and blunted fasting-induced ketone elevations, accompanied by ganglion cell loss, structural abnormalities on fundus and OCT imaging, and diminished scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) a- and b-wave amplitudes, consistent with impaired photoreceptor responses and downstream bipolar and Muller cell signaling. In contrast, RPE-specific BDH1 KO mice exhibited no changes in ERG responses or retinal morphology. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses in global KO retinas revealed disrupted Muller cell homeostasis, including reduced CAMKII-CREB activation, which is required for EAAT1 glutamate transporter expression. Administration of exogenous {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, in vitro and in vivo, restored CAMKII--CREB--EAAT1 signaling, glutamate uptake, and antioxidant gene expression in BDH1 KO mice, demonstrating a central role for ketone bodies in Muller cell metabolic support, glutamate homeostasis, and redox balance. Together with reduced BDH1 expression in human AMD retinas, these findings identify the BDH1--{beta}-hydroxybutyrate axis as a critical metabolic pathway for Muller cell function and retinal integrity, and highlight ketone metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in degenerative retinal diseases.",

      "content": "To better understand the cortical connections and organization of visual areas in galagos, we examined the interconnections among cortical visual fields and their relationships with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and temporal regions associated with dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In five galagos, two to four distinguishable tracers were injected into different visual areas, allowing direct comparison of connection patterns within the same cases. To reveal distributions of labeled neurons for each injection, labeled cells were plotted from serial brain sections cut parallel to the flattened cortical surface and summed across sections to generate surface reconstructions. Alternate sections processed for cytoarchitectonic features were used to identify cortical borders, especially those of V1 and middle temporal visual area (MT). Overall, our results support the conclusion that regions of V2 and V3 represent the contralateral visual hemifield in parallel with V1 and with each other. However, dorsal V3, representing the lower visual hemifield, includes at least one discontinuity where representations of the upper visual field extend to the dorsal border of V2. This portion of V3 appears to belong to the dorsomedial visual area (DM), which extends rostrally from V2 into PPC. The dorsal part of the DL-V4 region receives projections from other parts of dorsolateral visual area (DL), central V1, V2 and V3, inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the MT complex, and PPC regions surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). More central portions of DL-V4 receive inputs from central representations of V1, V2, and V3, as well as from PPC regions lateral to the IPS, the MT complex, and upper IT cortex. The ventral part of DL receives projections from central V2, caudal PPC adjoining DM and ventral PPC, and from IT cortex. These patterns indicate that the DL-V4 region serves as a major node linking dorsal and ventral streams and likely includes more than one functionally distinct visual area. In addition, areas MT and DM show strong reciprocal connections with PPC, while the connections of IT cortex indicate that much of this region is visual in nature having strong connections with higher order visual areas and it is composed of multiple functionally specialized visual domains.",

      "title": "MicroRNA-383-5p alleviates hemorrhagic transformation and improves outcomes after endovascular recanalization for acute ischemic stroke",
      "content": "Background: Hemorrhage transformation (HT) after reperfusion therapy is linked with poor outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients. This study aimed to determine the role of neuronal microRNA-383 in alleviating HT-associated injury using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen-glucose deprivation reoxygenation (OGD/R) models. Methods: In neurons following OGD/R, the family of miR-383 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression was evaluated. After miR-383-5p intervention and small interfering RNA, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuronal injury were assessed. Two hundred and five hyperglycemic rats were used to establish the HT model induced by mechanical reperfusion after 5-hour MCAO, followed by 3 and 6 hours of reperfusion, and treated with intravenous administration of miR-383-5p agomir before reperfusion. Brain water content, hemorrhage severity, infarct volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuronal apoptosis, ROS production, miR-383-5p and NOX4 expression, and BBB-associated proteins were assessed. Results: MiR-383-5p expression significantly decreased in OGD/R-treated neurons, while miR-383-3p expression did not differ. Elevating miR-383-5p levels reduced neuronal injury, ROS overproduction, and NOX4 overexpression as a target of miR-383-5p, shown in OGD/R-treated neurons. In the MCAO model, increased miR-383-5p suppressed NOX4 upregulation, alleviated brain edema, infarct volume, and hemorrhage severity, reduced neuronal apoptosis and ROS overproduction, and preserved BBB integrity after mechanical reperfusion for ischemia, thereby improving short-term neurological outcomes. Conclusions: MiR-383-5p alleviates oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis, and preserves BBB integrity by regulating NOX4. Neuronal miR-383-5p could become a potential target for intervention to decrease HT and ameliorate outcomes in endovascular reperfusion treatment for acute ischemic stroke.",

      "content": "Nuclear Factor I (NFI) misexpressions in humans are associated with severe brain malformations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that NFIs regulate the broad lineage progression and lifespan of radial glial progenitors (RGPs), and consequently neocortical development in a dose-dependent manner. Human cerebral organoids carrying patient-mimicking NFI mutations exhibit expression level-dependent bidirectional impairments in RGP temporal development, coinciding with patient phenotypes. In mouse models, selective removal of NFIs leads to a dramatic protraction of RGP lineage progression and lifespan, excessive progeny output, and neocortical overgrowth and abnormal folding, whereas overexpression of NFIs accelerates RGP lineage progression, resulting in developmental stage-dependent precocious productions of diverse neural progenies. Moreover, NFIs exhibit a positive auto-regulation and progressive increase in expression, and regulate distinct temporal-specific targets underlying RGP lineage progression. These results suggest that NFIs act as evolutionarily conserved key global temporal regulators of RGP lineage progression and neocortical development.",

      "content": "Tau PET is a powerful tool to assess tau pathology in vivo; however, in comparison to MRI, its development is more recent, is rarely available at scale, and substantially more difficult to acquire. Here, we present Covariate-Modulated Attention UNet (CoMA-UNet) to synthesize subject-specific 3D tau PET from T1 MRI while incorporating in the synthesis procedure readily available covariates. Across six external validation datasets, CoMA-UNet reproduced regional patterns of tau PET uptake showing strong agreement with true PET that was generalizable across tracers. Next, we submitted the synthetic tau PET to a series of downstream clinically relevant tasks. First, MMSE associations between the synthetic tau PET were statistically indistinguishable from true PET. Second, the synthetic tau PET achieved out-of-sample diagnostic classification of dementia with an AUROC=0.99. Third, out-of-sample synthetic tau PET tracked longitudinal progression with subject-level slopes closely matching true PET. Fourth, in two independent autopsy cohorts, voxel wise synthetic tau PET images closely followed neuropathologically defined Braak-stages. These findings demonstrate that the novel CoMA-UNet MRI-based synthesis augmented with covariate information can approximate tau PET with sufficient accuracy for downstream scientific and clinical applications.",
