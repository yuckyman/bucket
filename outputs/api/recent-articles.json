      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Retrosplenial cortex enables context-dependent goal-directed sensorimotor transformation",
      "content": "The ability to dynamically adjust a behavioral response to a stimulus depending on context is of critical importance for animals. To investigate the neural basis supporting context-dependent sensory processing we developed a behavioral task in which mice changed their response to a single whisker deflection according to a continuously present contextual cue. Through unbiased optogenetic inactivation mapping, we found that neuronal activity in sensory and motor cortices contributed to task execution and, interestingly, we uncovered an unexpected role of retrosplenial cortex for contextual integration. Widefield calcium imaging revealed that retrosplenial cortex was the first cortical area to show context discrimination in response to the whisker stimulus, followed by whisker motor cortex. Finally, we combined optogenetic inactivation with calcium imaging to define causal context-dependent changes in sensorimotor processing. Our cortex-wide mapping experiments thus begin to define key cortical nodes for context-dependent sensorimotor transformation and highlight an important contribution of retrosplenial cortex.",

      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",
