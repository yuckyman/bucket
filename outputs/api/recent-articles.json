      "title": "Characterization of aperiodic and theta activity in preterm infants using EEG: Insights into cerebral maturation and inter-individual variability",
      "content": "Preterm birth disrupts critical processes of brain development, impacting the maturation of brain structural organisation and functional activity. In early development, theta oscillations are thought to play a key role in supporting the formation and development of functional networks, but their maturation appears vulnerable to prematurity. Traditional EEG spectral analyses have indicated marked development of theta power in early infancy, but these approaches mix oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity, limiting insights into the mechanisms underlying the neural changes. Using spectral parametrisation, we aimed to evaluate developmental changes in aperiodic activity and periodic theta power in infants born very preterm compared to full-terms, and to further explore whether clinical factors and brain microstructure could explain the inter-individual variability within preterms. High-density EEG was acquired during active/REM sleep at term-equivalent age (TEA) and 2 months corrected age (2mCA) in 41 very preterm infants and 13 full-term controls. Spectral parameterization was used to extract aperiodic components (offset, exponent) and periodic theta power globally and across spatial clusters (anterior, central, posterior). From TEA to 2mCA, aperiodic offset and exponent, as well as theta power, increased with no differences between preterm and full-term infants. Cluster-based analyses revealed regional differences at each age and in their maturation over two months. At TEA, aperiodic metrics and theta power were stronger in anterior compared with posterior areas, but this regional landscape shifted by 2mCA for aperiodic metrics, driven by pronounced increases in aperiodic offset and exponent in posterior areas from TEA to 2mCA. Within preterms, inter-individual variability in aperiodic and periodic metrics at TEA was partly explained by clinical risk factors and variations in brain microstructure, as assessed with diffusion MRI at the same age. Male sex was characterised by lower theta power; lower gestational age at birth was associated with lower exponent; being small for gestational age was related to higher theta power, and invasive ventilation was linked to lower offset and exponent. Additionally, higher theta power correlated with lower cortical fractional anisotropy, consistent with more advanced cortical maturation. Collectively, these findings indicate that EEG spectral parameterization combined with spatial analysis provides a sensitive framework for characterising the postnatal maturation of brain activity in infants, as well as early vulnerabilities associated with prematurity and perinatal adversity.",

      "title": "Differential Cerebral White Matter Tract Alterations in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Revealed by Ultra-High Field 7T Diffusion-Weighted Imaging",
      "content": "Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic worry and emotional dysregulation, yet its underlying white matter (WM) architecture remains inconsistent in previous neuroimaging studies. This study aimed to delineate microstructural WM alterations in GAD using ultra-high field (7T) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced correlational tractography, evaluating their associations with symptom severity and diagnostic-aided value. Methods: Eighty-eight participants (27 GAD, 61 healthy controls, HCs) underwent 7T DTI scanning with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain correlational tractography was applied to identify tracts exhibiting significant group-related differences in diffusion indices while controlling for demographic covariates. Associations with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) scores were examined, and machine learning-based models were used to assess the diagnostic-aided utility of identified WM features. Results: Two tract bundles showed significant fractional anisotropy (FA) alterations in GAD: decreased FA in the right prefrontal pathway (P-FDR = 0.039) and increased FA in the right cingulum (P-FDR < 0.001). The anterior portions of both tracts exhibited stronger effects of GAD. FA in the right cingulum positively correlated with HAM-A and PSWQ scores, indicating that greater microstructural coherence was associated with higher anxiety and worry severity (both P-FDR < 0.001). Inclusion of WM features could improve classification performance beyond neuropsychological measures alone. Conclusions: Ultra-high field 7T tractometry revealed a differential pattern of WM abnormalities in GAD, suggesting weakened prefrontal control and hyper-integrated cingulate connectivity as structural correlates of emotional dysregulation. These findings indicate the potential of 7T DTI markers for advancing mechanistic and diagnostic understanding of GAD.",

      "title": "Bivalent habenula modulation of human monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways",
      "content": "The habenula is implicated in signaling negative reward prediction errors (RPE), yet direct causal evidence demonstrating its influence on downstream human brain circuits is limited. Using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and dynamic causal modelling across two negative RPE-inducing experimental tasks, we characterize habenula-directed connectivity with monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways in healthy adults. Negative feedback drove strong habenula inhibition of ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus activity, while positive feedback had an excitatory effect. These core effects are replicated across reversal learning and perceptual decision uncertainty tasks, establishing a generalizable mechanism for behavioral adaptation. Task-specific modulatory effects emerged in pathways between the subcortical and cortical regions (ventral tegmental area[-&gt;]dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus[-&gt;]medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex[-&gt;]habenula), revealing context-dependent cortical elaboration of negative RPE-driven habenula signals. This provides the first evidence in humans for bivalent causal modulation of habenula function on monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways, demonstrating how the brain integrates negative and positive signals to guide adaptive behavior.",
