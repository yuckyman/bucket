      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Background: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common complication that impairs function and quality of life (QoL). The comparative effectiveness of physical therapy interventions (PTIs) remains unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to identify the most effective PTIs for BCRL management. Methods: A systematic search of Medline/PubMed, LILACS, CENTRAL, PEDro, and CINAHL was conducted up to July 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled...",

      "content": "Background/Objectives: The spinal cord is a critical component of the central nervous system that transmits neural signals between the brain and the body's peripheral regions through its nerve roots. Despite being partially protected by the vertebral column, the spinal cord remains highly vulnerable to trauma, tumors, infections, and degenerative or inflammatory disorders. These conditions can disrupt neural conduction, resulting in severe functional impairments, such as paralysis, motor...",
