      "content": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) attempt to establish a connection between the human mind and a computer system. While recent computational advances continue to improve these interfaces, human factors have been overlooked. Factors such as fatigue and attention play a key role in brain signal modulation. This arises the need for paradigms designed and implemented in terms of human factors. Therefore, it is proposed to improve the level of engagement to diminish fatigue and increase attention by a...",

      "content": "Background: Passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) systems use a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning (ML) to evaluate a user's cognitive and physiological state, with increasing applications in both clinical and non-clinical scenarios. pBCI systems have been limited by their traditional reliance on sensor technologies that cannot easily be integrated into non-laboratory settings where pBCIs are most needed. Advances in textile-electrode-based EEG show promise in...",

      "content": "Unimodal brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from inherent limitations due to the characteristic of using single modalities. While hybrid BCIs combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer complementary advantages, effectively integrating their spatiotemporal features remains a challenge due to inherent signal asynchrony. This study aims to develop a novel deep fusion network to achieve synergistic integration of EEG and fNIRS signals...",
