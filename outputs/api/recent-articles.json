      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I built Beni (<a href=\"https://thebeni.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thebeni.ai</a>\n), a web app for real-time video calls with an AI companion.<p>The idea started as a pretty simple question: text chatbots are everywhere, but they rarely feel present. I wanted something closer to a call, where the character actually reacts in real time (voice, timing, expressions), not just \u201ctype, wait, reply\u201d.<p>Beni is basically:<p>A Live2D avatar that animates during the call (expressions + motion driven by the conversation)<p>Real-time voice conversation (streaming response, not \u201cwait 10 seconds then speak\u201d)<p>Long-term memory so the character can keep context across sessions<p>The hardest part wasn\u2019t generating text, it was making the whole loop feel synchronized: mic input, model response, TTS audio, and Live2D animation all need to line up or it feels broken immediately. I ended up spending more time on state management, latency and buffering than on prompts.<p>Some implementation details (happy to share more if anyone\u2019s curious):<p>Browser-based real-time calling, with audio streaming and client-side playback control<p>Live2D rendering on the front end, with animation hooks tied to speech / state<p>A memory layer that stores lightweight user facts/preferences and conversation summaries to keep continuity<p>Current limitation: sign-in is required today (to persist memory and prevent abuse). I\u2019m adding a guest mode soon for faster try-out and working on mobile view now.<p>What I\u2019d love feedback on:<p>Does the \u201creal-time call\u201d loop feel responsive enough, or still too laggy?<p>Any ideas for better lip sync / expression timing on 2D/3D avatars in the browser?<p>Thanks, and I\u2019ll be around in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46759627\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46759627</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There\u2019s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.</p> <p>Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the &quot;Alternatives&quot; section of the README.</p> <p><strong>Quick Demo</strong></p> <p>Here is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.</p> <pre><code>from darl import Engine def Prediction(ngn, region): model = ngn.FittedModel(region) data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return model + data def FittedModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region] return data + 1 + adj def Data(ngn): return 1 ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data]) ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return data + 99 ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel}) ngn2.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 101 # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 # Pulled from cache, not rerun ngn.trace().from_cache # -&gt; True </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Bar1754\"> /u/Global_Bar1754 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "[Project] Music Renamer CLI - A standalone tool to auto-rename audio files using Shazam",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I wanted to share a CLI tool I built to solve a personal headache: organizing folders full of unnamed music files (like `01 Audio Track.m4a`).</p> <p>**Repository &amp; Download:** <a href=\"https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI\">https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI</a></p> <p>### What My Project Does</p> <p>Music Renamer CLI automatically identifies and renames music files in a directory. It uses `ffmpeg` to capture a snippet of the audio and sends it to Shazam (via the `shazamio` library) to fetch metadata. It then renames the file to `Artist - Title.ext`.</p> <p>It is specifically optimized for Windows users:</p> <p>* It comes compiled as a standalone `.exe` (so non-coders don't need Python installed).</p> <p>* It includes a patch for SSL certificate errors (`aiohttp` often fails on older/corporate Windows machines due to missing certs).</p> <p>* It preserves the original file extension (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, etc.).</p> <p>### Target Audience</p> <p>This tool is for **music hoarders** or anyone with a messy &quot;Downloads&quot; folder who wants a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; solution. It is meant for production use on personal collections. It is particularly useful for Windows users who struggle with Python environment setups, as I focused heavily on the PyInstaller build process to bundle dependencies correctly.</p> <p>I created this tool because I personally struggled using MusicBrainz Picard to recognize some old songs I had on a disc, and I needed something simpler that just worked based on audio fingerprinting.</p> <p>### Comparison</p> <p>* **Vs MusicBrainz Picard:** Picard is the gold standard but is a heavy GUI application that requires manual interaction and clustering. My tool is a lightweight CLI designed for quick, automated &quot;fire and forget&quot; renaming based on audio fingerprinting rather than existing metadata.</p> <p>* **Vs Standard Shazam:** Standard Shazam identifies one song at a time manually. This tool handles batch processing of entire folders.</p> <p>* **Vs AudioTag:** This runs locally (mostly) and doesn't require uploading full files to a web service, only the fingerprint is sent.</p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback on the code structure or the Windows build approach!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidEstablishment70\"> /u/SolidEstablishment70 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",
