      "title": "Motor implementation of control and reward-based urgency regulation across impulsivity",
      "content": "Everyday decisions unfold dynamically, with commitment shaped by a growing sense of urgency that can, when excessive, contribute to impulsive choices. Here we aimed at dissociating two modes of urgency regulation, control-driven (accuracy-oriented) and reward-driven (motivation-based), and asked whether their relative influence varies across individuals differing in impulsivity. We further investigated how these regulatory modes are implemented in the motor system, focusing on two modulatory effects: surround inhibition and broad modulation. Healthy participants, whose impulsivity was assessed with the UPPS urgency dimension, performed a modified Tokens task crossing control demands (low vs high control blocks) with motivational context (low vs high reward trials). In two separate sessions, single-pulse TMS was applied either over the hand motor representation to probe corticospinal excitability indexing surround inhibition, or over the leg representation to index broad modulations of motor activity. This design successfully dissociated the two regulatory modes: control-driven adjustments (across blocks) were most evident in less impulsive participants, whereas reward-driven adjustments (across trials) were most evident in more impulsive participants. Consistent with this dissociation, control-driven urgency regulation was associated with broad modulation of motor activity, whereas reward-driven urgency adjustments were associated with changes in surround inhibition. These motor signatures may serve as probes of the respective contributions of control- and reward-driven regulation even when they are not explicitly dissociated. Our findings suggest that impulsivity may not simply reflect 'more urgency' but a different weighting of the influences that shape it during decision making, a hypothesis that can now be tested in clinical conditions.",

      "title": "Alpha oscillations are dysrhythmic in Fragile X syndrome",
      "content": "Background: Alpha oscillations are dominant rhythms in the human brain, supporting inhibitory control and coordination of neural activity. Altered alpha dynamics are observed across many neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. FXS exhibits paradoxical alpha power: elevated absolute but reduced relative power. To resolve this incongruity, we considered that conventional power metrics, relying on averaging, may obscure the underlying critical temporal dynamics of such neural rhythms. Methods: Here, we investigate alpha oscillations in FXS as a model to decompose nonspecific alpha abnormalities into underlying temporal features. We used cycle-by-cycle (bycycle) alpha burst analysis from source-localized resting-state EEG of 70 individuals with FXS and 71 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. Statistical modeling examined group, sex, and regional differences in alpha burst features using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results: We reveal that alpha bursts in FXS show reduced count only in males, prolonged periods across sexes, and elevated amplitudes, particularly in males. Spatial mapping identified differential circuit vulnerability: timing-associated dysregulation in cognitive-control regions and amplitude elevations in sensory cortices. Within the FXS group, global alpha burst amplitude correlated with hyperactivity symptoms and inversely with general intelligence scores, and burst count correlated with age. Limitations: This study is limited by its resting-state design and cross-sectional nature. Future studies should explore task-based modulation of alpha burst features and longitudinal trajectories in FXS. Additionally, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) was not quantified for participants, limiting potential stratification by molecular severity. Conclusions: These findings resolve paradoxical alpha power in FXS into features consistent with interneuron dysfunction, demonstrating the potential for burst-level decomposition in mechanistic hypothesis generation and biomarker development across neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Individual Differences in Dopaminergic Modulation of Exploration-Exploitation Behaviour",
      "content": "Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in exploration-exploitation behaviour, i.e., exploring novel, potentiallybetter options vs. exploiting known, previously rewarding options. Impairments in this trade-off occur inpsychiatric disorders involving DAergic dysfunction, including addiction and schizophrenia. Pharmacologicalstudies revealed a contribution of DA to exploration, but inconsistent findings suggest that interindividualvariability in baseline DA may modulate effects. To address this, we investigated the effects of the DAprecursor L-DOPA on exploration-exploitation during reinforcement learning in a sample of N = 75 healthyparticipants (n = 32 women), following a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pre-registered design(https://osf.io/p2r7u). We assessed whether putative baseline DA markers, including spontaneouseye blink rate, working memory (WM) capacity, and impulsivity, modulated drug effects and probed visualfixation patterns and pupil dilation as markers of exploration. L-DOPA had no overall effect on computationalmodel parameters of random exploration, directed exploration or choice perseveration. WM capacitymoderated drug effects on random exploration, with stronger effects at higher WM capacity. Remaining DAproxies showed no credible effects. Pooling the data from male participants with that from an earlier male-only study (Chakroun et al., 2020; total N = 74), L-DOPA increased uncertainty-dependent value weightingand perseveration strength, while decreasing habit updating, indicating a stronger tendency to repeatprevious choices and slower decay of their influence over time. No credible drug effects were observed infemale participants. Pupil dilation was tonically increased under L-DOPA and scaled with explorationbehaviour and prediction error, confirming that pupillometry can index exploration-exploitation dynamics.Visual exploration patterns reflected uncertainty-driven sampling, but were unaffected by L-DOPA. Takentogether, results suggest that DAergic modulation of exploration and perseveration behaviour may becontingent on cognitive capacity and sex, rather than exerting uniform effects across individuals.",

      "title": "Counting apples - How does the prefrontal region support early numerical understanding in preschool children?",
      "content": "Because early maths skills strongly predict later outcomes, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that shape early learning in children. The recent years have seen an increase in studying the neural correlates that support the acquisition of maths skills. However, existing work in early childhood has primarily focused on core number-processing regions in the parietal regions, with comparatively little attention to the supportive role of prefrontal regions. In this study, we examined the engagement of the prefrontal regions when matching numbers and objects. Children (N=60, 25 girls, aged 2.74-5.18 years) matched auditory small (1-3) and large (5-7) numbers, as well as objects (fruits) to corresponding visual pictures while their frontoparietal brain responses were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Importantly, matching large numbers was substantially more difficult than matching small numbers or objects. The analysis revealed that children had increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus when matching large numbers, compared to small numbers. However, there was no difference in the prefrontal region between matching small numbers and objects. The connectivity analysis further revealed increased frontoparietal connectivity when matching small numbers, but not large numbers or objects. Our findings suggest that prefrontal involvement during early numerical knowledge acquisition relies primarily on domain-general mechanisms, with number-specific responses likely to emerge later in development.",

      "title": "The progression of sex differences in brain networks across the lifespan",
      "content": "Sex differences in brain connectivity are well documented, yet how these differences evolve across the human lifespan remains poorly understood. Rigorously assessing sex-dependent trajectories of brain network organization is challenging due to difficulty in acquiring, processing, and modeling high-dimensional connectomes. Here, we analyzed 15 types of functional and structural connectivity networks from 1286 healthy individuals aged 8-100+ years, using our new AI-based Krakencoder to derive a low-dimensional multimodal \"fusion\" connectome representation. Sex differences were minimal in early childhood, pronounced in young to mid-adulthood, and diverged across modalities in later life: functional connectivity grew less distinct and structural connectivity grew more distinct from midlife onward. Functional differences were driven predominantly by higher-order association networks (default mode, control), while structural differences concentrated in lower-order cerebellar and subcortical pathways. These findings provide a lifespan-wide, multimodal map of sex differences in brain networks which may help inform sex-specific vulnerability and resilience to brain disorders.",

      "title": "Topographical differences during motion processing in autistic and dyslexic children",
      "content": "Atypical motion processing has been reported in multiple developmental conditions, including autism and dyslexia, and taken as support for a general developmental vulnerability in the dorsal stream. Yet by uncovering dynamically unfolding processes, electroencephalography can determine the extent to which motion processing signatures are shared or distinct across different developmental conditions. Here we used pre-registered topographical analyses across the whole high-density electrode array to determine, for the first time, whether autistic and dyslexic children activate the same or distinct brain pathways as typically developing children, when completing two motion processing tasks. Participants were 29 autistic, 44 dyslexic and 57 typically developing children aged 6 to 14 years. Group differences in overall brain response strength were found in both tasks. Topographical activity differed in both autistic and dyslexic children compared to typically developing children (but not between autistic and dyslexic children) in a motion coherence task between 456 - 560 ms. However, group differences in a direction integration task (with no incoherent motion) depended on stimulus difficulty and time window (434 - 500 ms and 538 - 638 ms), with different patterns of divergence from typical development in autism and dyslexia. These results suggest that there are differences in the brain networks used to accomplish motion processing tasks in both autistic and dyslexic children, and demonstrate the utility of a topographical approach for detecting group differences in neural mechanisms, which can be missed by univariate approaches.",

      "title": "Neural representations of speech production in neocortical and cerebellar regions",
      "content": "Speech production depends on the precise temporal integration of articulatory movements with phonation. While ventral primary motor cortex is known to encode articulatory features, how phonatory timing, and its coordination with articulation, is represented across cortical and cerebellar circuits remains poorly understood. Using 7T functional MRI, we examined neural representations during overt syllable production varying in place of articulation and voice onset time. Multivariate analyses revealed reliable, syllable-specific differences in activity patterns across both cortical and cerebellar speech regions. Ventral primary sensorimotor cortex distinguished syllables by place of articulation, whereas dorsal sensorimotor cortex was more sensitive to the timing of voice onset relative to articulation. Secondary sensorimotor speech areas, including the operculum and auditory cortex, showed a hybrid representational profile, integrating both articulatory and phonatory features. In the cerebellum, representational geometry was dominated by the place of articulation; however, overall syllable representations were most similar to those in the operculum, accounting for unique variance beyond that explained by ventral sensorimotor cortex. Together, these findings reveal feature-specific representational tuning across primary sensorimotor regions during speech production. The selective representational alignment between operculum and cerebellum may support the refinement of speech motor plans prior to execution.",

      "title": "The richness of little voices: using artificial intelligence to understand early language development",
      "content": "How informative are preschoolers' speech vocalizations? Preschoolers' speech is often imprecise, highly variable and hard to interpret by humans and machines; consequently, its predictive value for later developmental outcomes remains quite underexplored. Here, we analyzed 6.595 brief vocalizations (0.5-5s) from 127 preschoolers aged 3-4 years, including 74 children with diagnosed language delay, recorded in naturalistic environments. The vocalization models robustly distinguished children with and without language delay (ROC-AUC 0.90), beyond the acoustic properties of the recordings (ROC-AUC: 0.62), and outperformed similar models analyzing metadata that literature reports as predictive factor for early language development (ROC-AUC: < 0.69 [95% CI: 0.08 - 0.15 to 0.48 - 0.73], P < 0.001]). This indicates that neural networks applied to foundational model audio vectorizations can extract meaningful developmental markers from brief samples of immature speech, to classify speech status, offering a promising, scalable approach for language abilities early screening.",
