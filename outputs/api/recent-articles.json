      "title": "Electroconvulsive Therapy Induces Dopaminergic Axon Regeneration, Corticostriatal Remodeling, and Restoration of Motor Function in Parkinsonian Mice",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons with loss of axonal dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum, leading to striatal circuit dysfunction and debilitating motor symptoms. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not restore lost neuronal function. Decades of clinical observations have reported the unexpected observation that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a standard treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, can incidentally alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD, two weeks of repeated ECT produced robust and sustained motor recovery, with improvements in locomotion and sensorimotor asymmetry persisting for at least 30 days post-treatment. Remarkably, ECT induced dopaminergic axonal sprouting from surviving dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located at the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental border, leading to a partial recovery of striatal dopaminergic axonal reinnervation. In striatal direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), which exhibit pathological hyperexcitability and spine loss following dopamine depletion, ECT normalized both corticostriatal synaptic responses and spine density. Consistently, ECT upregulated gene transcripts involved in cytoskeletal remodeling while downregulating those associated with glutamatergic signaling and neuronal excitability. These changes were accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional shift toward enhanced mitochondrial anabolic capacity and energy production, including increased expression of genes involved in ATP and Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that ECT can partially restore basal ganglia circuitry following dopamine depletion and provide a basis for further study of its potential as a noninvasive, disease-modifying intervention for PD.",

      "title": "Tau interactions with inner nuclear envelope proteins modulates chromatin",
      "content": "Intracellular re-distribution of the neuronal microtubule associated protein Tau, from the axon into the somatodendritic compartment, is a physiological stress-related event that increases Tau in the soma and enables Tau interactions with the nucleus. Cellular functions of stress-induced Tau-Nucleus interactions are unknown. Combining proximity biotinylation interactomics with chromatin imaging and molecular reconstitution assays, we uncover that physiological Tau interacts with proteins coordinating chromatin at the nuclear membrane, including lamin B receptor, thereby changing their DNA interactions. Accordingly, we find that increasing somatodendritic Tau is sufficient to dysregulate expression of genes in lamin associated domains and transcription factors, collectively leading to an upregulation of stress response pathways and downregulation of cholesterol metabolic genes. These nuclear envelope-related mechanisms suggest that neuronal stress-related somatodendritic Tau missorting can initiate chromatin-related cascades important for early changes in AD and tauopathies.",

      "title": "Anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus",
      "content": "The medial thalamus (MTh) is a critical hub for integrating the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet its cellular and circuit organization remains poorly defined. Here, we combine activity-dependent genetic tagging, whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and viral circuit tracing to build a comprehensive anatomical and molecular atlas of nociceptive and opioidergic neurons within the MTh. We show that acute and chronic pain activate distinct, spatially localized microdomains across multiple MTh subnuclei, including the central medial, interanteromedial, mediodorsal, and xiphoid nuclei. Activity-dependent tagging reveals a stable ensemble of nociceptive neurons that remains engaged across acute and chronic pain states, suggesting persistent thalamic encoding of affective nociception. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we find that most nociceptive-activated neurons express Oprm1, and that nearly all Oprm1 neurons are activated by nociceptive stimuli, identifying a pain-active, -opioid receptor-expressing population in MTh (MThMOR). Rabies-based tracing demonstrates that MThMOR neurons receive convergent inputs from nociceptive and inhibitory regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and habenula, while projecting broadly to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures involved in pain, arousal, and motivation. Enkephalinergic inputs to MTh arise from distinct, non-nociceptive populations, suggesting parallel pathways for nociceptive transmission and endogenous opioid modulation. Together, these findings define the anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus and highlight MThMOR neurons as a cell-type-specific substrate for the development of targeted opioid-based pain therapies.",

      "title": "Phospho-signalling deregulation of the mTOR pathway in fibroblasts from LRRK2 Parkinson s patients",
      "content": "Activating mutations at the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Using in-depth mass-spectrometry, here we analysed the impact of LRRK2 mutations on the proteome and phospho-proteome of skin fibroblasts from a large LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain. The cohort encompassed G2019S LRRK2-associated PD (L2PD) (n=15), G2019S LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers (L2NMCs) (n=13), idiopathic PD (iPD) (n=12), and control subjects (n=14) (total n=54). The proteome analysis revealed 89 differential proteins in G2019S L2PD (58 down/ 31 up) and 168 in G2019S L2NMCs (127 down / 41 up) compared to controls. Most of these proteome changes involved deficits in proteins related to mitochondrial energy and ribosomal protein synthesis. At the phospho-proteome level, we identified 394 differential phospho-sites in G2019S L2PD (188 hyper / 206 hypo), 367 in G2019S L2NMCs (215 hyper / 152 hypo), and 428 in iPD (214 hyper / 214 hypo) compared with controls. These phospho-proteomic changes included hyper-phosphorylated proteins associated with the mTOR and Rho GTPase pathways. Notably, the top hyper-phosphorylated hit in G2019S carriers was pThr37/46 4E-BP1, a key effector of the mTOR pathway controlling protein synthesis, and this protein was also deregulated in iPD. In summary, our study uncovers peripheral deregulation of mTOR phospho-signalling associated with LRRK2 mutations, which is related to deficits in mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins, and affects converging pathways altered in iPD.",

      "title": "Encoding and Decoding of Brain Dynamic Functional Connectivity for ADHD Diagnosis",
      "content": "Recent studies have demonstrated strong associations between the changes in dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and both behavioral and cognitive functions. The sliding window technique is the most widely used method for evaluating dynamic FC; however, it faces two key challenges: distributional shifts across windows and high dimensionality, as FC is computed across windows of the entire time series. To address these issues, we propose BRAINMAP (Bi-level Representation using Attention for INterpretability with Mamba-Aided Prediction) to model the dynamic FC of the brain. BRAINMAP employs the Optimal Transport technique to correct distributional shifts across sliding windows and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a hybrid approach that integrates an attention mechanism and the Mamba block to effectively capture spatiotemporal features for functional MR images. Finally, we introduce a novel Top-K sliding window feature selection algorithm to induce sparsity in dynamic FC. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our model for diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using three resting-state fMRI datasets: ADHD-200, UCLA, and CNI-TLC, which comprise a total of 447 subjects with ADHD and 845 typically developing controls. Our architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art dynamic FC models in ADHD detection, achieving improvements ranging from 3% to 12% across the three datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces robust biomarkers, most notably the connection between the dorsal attention network and the visual network. Using an association study, we further establish the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers.",

      "title": "Metabolic modelling and time-resolved mapping of glucose oxidative metabolism in rats brain by indirect deuterium detection with 1H-FID-MRSI at 9.4T",
      "content": "Object: The present study exploits newly developed dynamic indirect 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI at 9.4T, combined with a dedicated metabolic model, to enable regional and quantitative characterization of glucose oxidative metabolism flux in the rat brain with minimal metabolic assumptions, by measuring both 2H-labelled Glx turnover and pool size along a controlled 2H-Glc infusion protocol. Materials and Methods: Seven rats underwent dynamic 2D 1H-FID-MRSI during a 2-hour infusion of [6,6'-2H2] glucose. Consecutive 13-min acquisitions quantified Glx-C4 1H-signal decay, converted to 2H-Glx concentrations using baseline metabolite pool sizes. A three-pool kinetic model including 2H-label loss was fitted to regional turnover curves to estimate oxidative flux (Vgt) and pyruvate dilution (Kdil). Model performance and parameter robustness were finally assessed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: In vivo 2H-Glx turnover showed a saturated exponential rise (~60 min), with a labelling plateau higher in striatum (1.85 mol/g) than hippocampus (1.55 mol/g). Metabolic modelling provided region-specific oxidative fluxes: Vgt = 0.27 {+/-} 0.07 mol/g/min (hippocampus) and Vgt = 0.40 {+/-} 0.06 mol/g/min (striatum), with consistent Kdil across regions. Simulations confirmed a good model robustness in retrieving Vgt over a large range of experimental conditions. Discussion: This work shows the appropriateness of indirect dynamic 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI for quantitative metabolic flux mapping of cerebral glucose oxidative metabolism.

      "title": "Towards harmonized spectral quantification in MRSI: Comparative analysis of Backward-Linear-Predicted and original 1H-FID-MRSI dephased data",
      "content": "Object: We hypothesized that the inherent acquisition delay (AD) in 1H-FID-MRSI can introduce systematic LCModel quantification biases due to strong spectral dephasing, and that Backward-Linear-Prediction (BLP) reconstruction toward AD = 0 ms can harmonize metabolite estimates across acquisitions with various delays. Materials and Methods: 2D 1H-FID-MRSI were acquired in rats at 14.1T with three AD values (0.71, 0.94, 1.30 ms). Hippocampal metabolites were quantified using LCModel and AD-matched basis sets. Complementary Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 1000) replicated 1H-FID-MRSI spectra at multiple ADs under realistic SNR conditions. BLP was applied to in vivo and simulated FIDs to back-predict missing points up to AD = 0 ms, enabling quantification within a unified basis set framework. Results: In vivo and simulated data showed clear AD-dependent variations for several metabolites (Gln, tCho, tNAA, Ins, Tau), with discrepancies frequently >10% despite AD-specific basis sets. Simulations confirmed metabolite-specific biases increasing with AD. BLP reconstruction preserved quantification consistency up to 0.98 ms of recovered FIDs, reducing inter-AD mismatches in vivo - particularly for Tau, tNAA and tCho - lowering the mean discrepancy from 10.5% to approx. 5%. Discussion: These findings show that AD affects 1H-FID-MRSI quantification in LCModel, whereas BLP reconstruction can harmonize spectra across delays by enabling a virtual AD = 0 ms quantification scheme. This supports BLP as a practical strategy to improve consistency and comparability in MRSI studies.

      "content": "Understanding how anatomical connectivity shapes brain activity is essential for clarifying brain function and disorders. In the human brain, the regional heterogeneity in structure-function (S-F) coupling is well characterized by measuring correlations between structural and functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether the same principles apply to the mouse cortex, where biological mechanisms can be studied directly. Here, we mapped S-F coupling across the mouse cortex by combining high-resolution structural connectivity derived from axonal tracing with resting-state functional connectivity measured by wide-field calcium imaging. Our findings revealed that structural connectivity imposes a robust yet regionally variable constraint on functional connectivity. As in humans, the S-F coupling was strong in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas, demonstrating a gradient from unimodal-to-transmodal cortical organization. This spatial variation covaried with intrinsic cellular properties, including myelination, excitation-inhibition balance, synaptic density, and gene expression profiles, but did not align with the anatomically defined cortical hierarchy. Our findings highlight graded S-F coupling as a common organizational principle in both the mouse and human cortex, providing a framework for future mechanistic studies using mouse models.",

      "content": "Pattern separation converts overlapping experiences into discrete memory traces, with granule-cell sparsity in the dentate gyrus (DG) thought to execute this computation. Proximal CA3 is functionally aligned with the DG through dense reciprocal connectivity, yet the manner in which DG output governs pattern separation within proximal CA3 remains unresolved. This study combined selective DG lesions with high-resolution recordings across the CA3 while rats explored environments that varied in contextual similarity. Global remapping in CA3 remained largely intact following DG lesion, but rate remapping was almost entirely abolished. Discrimination impairments were most pronounced in proximal CA3 and attenuated along the transverse axis toward distal CA3, paralleling the topography of mossy-fiber projections. These data support a hierarchical and mode-specific framework for pattern separation: the entorhinal cortex selects between global and rate remapping according to input dissimilarity, while the DG selectively enhances discrimination of similar inputs via rate-based modulation. This mechanism clarifies how the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit resolves overlapping experiences into distinct memory representations.",

      "content": "The aging paradox describes improvements in emotional wellbeing as a function of aging, despite declines in cognition. Conversely, late life depression has been associated with increased cognitive decline in aging. We sought to understand these seemingly contradictory patterns of cognitive and mental health in older age. Building on cognitive reserve, affective reserve, and brain reserve models of aging, we developed three alternative algorithmic approaches to group N=22,686 participants from the UK Biobank into different profiles of aging. Our results revealed that aging profiles identified using our data-driven brain reserve model, which incorporated measures of cognition, neuroticism, and brain volume, achieved the highest validation results. Importantly, only two of the four aging profiles were characterized by the aging paradox (i.e., improved emotionality and decreased cognition with age). We identified one profile characterized by particularly low levels of neuroticism and relative resilience to cognitive decline. Another profile benefited from relatively preserved brain volumes, potentially driven by younger ages and/or higher socioeconomic status. Conversely, we identified two profiles with poorer health characteristics, including one profile with elevated cardiovascular risk. Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of the emotion paradox and highlight the value of taking a nuanced and stratified approach when studying aging. In the future, aging profiles could be used to target preventative strategies to address modifiable risk factors and improve lifespan and healthspan.",
