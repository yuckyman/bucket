      "title": "Integrative Analysis of Spatial Transcriptome and Connectome by SpaCon",
      "content": "The brain's structure and function arise from its complex molecular composition and neural connectivity, yet the relationship between cell-type-specific gene expression and brain-wide connectivity is not well understood. By integrating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics and connectomics, we reveal a tight coupling between gene expression and anatomical connectivity in the cortico-thalamic circuit, and identify specific gene expression in axons of the corpus callosum that reflect their cortical origins. Building on these findings, we developed SpaCon, a graph attention autoencoder that uses a tunable hyperparameter to flexibly integrate global connectivity with local gene expression. To enable analysis at the whole-brain scale, SpaCon introduces an efficient neighbor sampling strategy that drastically reduces computational requirements without compromising performance. This architecture allows the model to identify functionally relevant three-dimensional domains defined by both molecular identity and shared connectivity patterns, even when spatially distant. Validated across diverse datasets and species, SpaCon significantly enhances the prediction of connectivity from gene expression and improves the spatial classification of neuronal subtypes. SpaCon thus provides a powerful, scalable, and versatile framework for understanding the complex relationship between transcriptome and connectome.",

      "title": "Intra- and Interhemispheric Signatures of Criticality at the Onset of Synchronization",
      "content": "The cerebral cortex must flexibly alternate between locally segregated activity that supports specialization and long-range interactions that enable integration. How cortical networks balance these competing demands remains unclear. We propose that fluctuations around a critical point between ordered and disordered phases provide a natural framework to understand coordinated neuronal activity across scales. Using simultaneous spiking recordings from the left and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) of freely behaving rats, we found that signatures of criticality emerged at the onset of neuronal synchronization, both locally within individual hemispheres and globally across the combined population. Over time, cortical activity explored a continuum of intra- and interhemispheric synchrony levels, including states in which neurons were locally desynchronized yet maintained interhemispheric coupling. A computational model operating near its critical regime reproduced these empirical patterns, capturing the characteristic relationship between local and long-range coordination. These results suggest that cortical networks achieve flexible transitions between local and global computation by fluctuating around a critical regime.",

      "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
      "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

      "title": "OpenXstim: an open-source programmable electrical stimulator for transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation therapy",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

      "title": "A logarithmic theory of visuomotor stabilization",
      "content": "Although many animals rely on visual information to navigate, optic flow is inherently ambiguous as it confounds information about motion speed and object distance. As a result, the visual feedback produced by a given motor command is context-dependent and requires an appropriately adapted response. Recent experiments have investigated how the fish Danionella cerebrum use visual cues to stabilize their position against simulated external currents. Logarithmic sensorimotor transformations have been proposed to enable adaptive responses to perturbations while preventing delay-induced instabilities. Here, we develop the theoretical framework introduced for continuous locomotion to show how logarithmic coding naturally gives rise to this adaptive behavior. The system is modeled by a nonlinear delay differential equation, which is analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We further analyze experimental data to uncover the mechanisms underlying swimming initiation and positional drift correction. Finally, we extend our framework to intermittent locomotion, resulting in a nonlinear difference equation, and show that it still produces robust adaptive behavior. This is motivated by the literature on zebrafish, where visuomotor stabilization has been extensively studied, but burst-and-coast swimming obscures the underlying adaptation mechanism. We show that our theory can reproduce the experimental results reported for motor adaptation in zebrafish without invoking internal models. Overall, our results highlight logarithmic coding as a unifying principle for visuomotor stability across continuous and intermittent locomotor regimes.",

      "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
      "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

      "title": "Evaluating group interactions in epileptic brain networks by hypergraph and higher-order homophily",
      "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "title": "Short Excitatory Projections Promote Burst Activity and Modular Functional Organization in Neural Networks",
      "content": "Physical constraints in the brain favor short, distance-dependent connections. However, short-range projections are not merely a compromise imposed by these constraints; they also serve essential functional roles. Here, we explore networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, demonstrating that short excitatory projections fundamentally increase the number of common presynaptic inputs, thereby enhancing the correlations of neural responses. Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions. Therefore, this structural principle provides a mechanistic basis for functional column formation and dynamic burst propagation, suggesting that the brain transforms structural wiring constraints into opportunities for complex computation and distributed processing. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain transforms structural limitations into opportunities for complex computation.",

      "title": "EEG Reveals Robust Within-Person but Unstable Between-Person Neural Encoding of Pain",
      "content": "The perception of pain varies both within and between individuals, even when sensory input remains constant. Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations. EEG markers may therefore be more suitable for tracking longitudinal changes in pain within individuals than for comparing pain sensitivity across individuals.",

      "title": "A frontal motor circuit for economic decisions and actions",
      "content": "Flexible behaviour requires transforming abstract cognitive representations, such as value preferences, into concrete motor actions. During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear. Here we show that a frontal motor network performs this transformation through dynamic circuit reconfiguration across decision stages. Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.",

      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.
