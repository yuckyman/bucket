It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Bayesian multilevel modeling of group and participant level effect sizes: Stronger inter-individual differences in pupil dilation compared to EEG alpha power during aversive conditioning",
      "content": "Aversive conditioning prompts reliable changes in the power of EEG alpha-band oscillations and pupil dilation. Both variables have been used to test hypotheses on the acquisition, generalization, and extinction of conditioned threat. Existing studies have largely relied on trial averages and group-level analyses. Thus, the variability of these physiological markers to aversive learning at the subject level is currently unknown. Comparisons of group-level analyses in prior studies suggest that pupil dilation and EEG-alpha activity capture complementary information. However, to date, no study has directly compared these two markers in terms of their effect sizes at the level of individual participants. The present study employed Bayesian multilevel modeling to quantify the variability of conditioning effect estimates for alpha-band power and pupillometry. Estimates were examined at the group level and at the participant level, across two conditioning paradigms, involving visual and auditory cues. Although the two metrics shared similar effect sizes at the group level, participant-level variability in these effect sizes was substantially higher for pupil-dilation compared to alpha-power, and this finding was replicated across both paradigms. These findings have important implications for clinical and inter-individual difference research which requires both the quantification of effects at the participant-level as well as meaningful variability between-participants that can be linked to relevant differences such as anxiety.",

      "title": "Structured Neural Variability from Repeated Naturalistic Video Watching Experiences",
      "content": "The brain continuously integrates perception and interpretation processes to navigate dynamic environments. It is often assumed that these processes are invariant to repeated experiences. Here we investigated how neural responses to naturalistic stimuli evolve across multiple viewings using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty participants watched 24 short videos across five separate scanning sessions. Between-subject correlations (BSC) decreased progressively across all brain regions with repeated viewing, indicating increasing individual variability. Within-subject correlations (WSC) consistently exceeded BSC, demonstrating that individuals are more similar to themselves than to others. However, the structure of within-subject variability differed fundamentally between sensory and interpretive regions. Early visual cortex exhibited strong repetition effects, with brain activity becoming increasingly dissimilar with each successive viewing, accompanied by reduced coupling to low-level visual features and decreased anti-correlation with default mode regions. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed temporal proximity effects, where sessions closer in time exhibited more similar activity patterns regardless of viewing number. This temporal structure in vmPFC aligned with fluctuations in participants' video preferences across sessions. These findings suggest that repeated experiences are never processed identically: sensory systems adapt efficiently to familiar input while interpretive systems continuously reshape meaning based on current internal states.",

      "title": "ICAM-5: A Novel Marker for Neuronally Derived Extracellular Vesicles.",
      "content": "Current methods for isolating neuronal-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) from human biofluids lack specificity. In addition, some of the reported markers for NDEV isolation are present as soluble proteins instead of extracellular vesicle (EV) associated proteins. To address the research gap, this study aimed to identify a novel marker for NDEV isolation that is NDEV associate and highly specific to the central nervous system. To achieve this, human cortical neurons were used for isolation of EVs invitro. Mass spectroscopy was performed to screen for potential EV surface markers. This analysis yielded 63 brain specific proteins among which ICAM-5 was selected for further validations in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Our analysis shows that ICAM-5 is present on the surface of NDEVs, colocalizing with standard extracellular vesicle markers like CD-63 and CD-9. We further confirm that NDEVs isolated using ICAM-5 contain neuronal proteins (tau, neuronal specific enolase) but not glial markers. Using ICAM-5 as a NDEV marker, EVs were eluted from human serum samples of with traumatic brain injury. Our results show enhanced levels of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a marker of neurological injury, in serum samples from patients with TBI when compared to currently known markers of NDEV. Our findings demonstrate that ICAM-5 is specific EV associated marker for isolating NDEVs from human biofluids that can potentially improve the enrichment of NDEVs from biofluids thereby improving diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.",

      "title": "Interval Timing Shows Selective Enhancement Under Psychosocial Stress: A Cortisol-Mediated Dissociation From Spatial Processing",
      "content": "Acute stress affects cognitive processes, including our perception of time, yet few studies have examined how HPA axis activation specifically modulates time perception. This study provides the first systematic examination of how psychosocial stress influences temporal versus spatial reproduction using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), investigating underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Forty-four healthy adults (21 men; mean age 21.96 +/- 3.03) completed temporal and spatial reproduction tasks before and after TSST, with salivary cortisol sampling and DNA methylation analysis of four dopamine-related genes (COMT, DRD2, SLC6A3, TH). The TSST successfully elevated cortisol and state anxiety, confirming effective HPA axis activation. Critically, stress selectively reduced temporal underestimation. Despite their shared neurocognitive mechanisms, spatial processing remained unchanged. This demonstrates that HPA-mediated stress enhances interval timing. Men demonstrated greater stress-induced improvement in temporal accuracy than women, while neither sex showed significant spatial changes, independent of cortisol reactivity differences. The results are discussed in the context of dopaminergic models of temporal processing. Exploratory epigenetic analyses revealed a DRD2 methylation and cortisol response interaction for temporal tasks, with higher methylation associated with greater stress-induced improvement among high cortisol responders. However, sensitivity analysis indicated these interactions were driven by participants with extreme methylation values, limiting the generalizability of epigenetic results. These findings demonstrate that acute psychosocial stress selectively enhances temporal accuracy, potentially through cortisol-dopamine interactions in corticostriatal timing circuits. This work opens avenues for investigating stress-timing mechanisms and cortisol-dopamine interactions in timing circuits, and provides preliminary evidence for epigenetic moderation.",

      "title": "Pupil dilation indexes - but does not causally influence - conscious error detection: a double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of performance-monitoring using atomoxetine.",
      "content": "Background: Conscious error detection is accompanied by error-related changes in phasic autonomic activity. This autonomic response is diminished in older age - accompanied by impairments in the conscious detection of action errors - i.e., increased \"error blindness\". Indeed, the degree to which the autonomic response to errors declines across the lifespan is correlated with the increase in error blindness. However, the direction of causality - whether changes in autonomic reactivity are a consequence or cause of increased error blindness - is still debated. In the present study, we experimentally modulated the phasic autonomic response to action errors in healthy older adults while measuring their conscious error detection. Methods: Across two sessions, thirty healthy older adults (60-80 years old) were given the sNRI atomoxetine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. In each session, they performed an anti-saccade task, which is commonly used to test conscious error detection. The autonomic response to errors was measured via changes in pupil dilation. A novelty-oddball task was also employed as a manipulation check. Results: Atomoxetine reduced phasic pupil dilation to both novel stimuli in the novelty-oddball task and to action errors in the anti-saccade task. However, despite this blunting of the phasic autonomic response to errors, there were no significant differences in conscious error awareness between atomoxetine and placebo. Primary task performance was also unaffected. Conclusions: Despite its effects on phasic autonomic activity after errors, atomoxetine had no effect on conscious error detection in healthy older adults. This suggests that phasic autonomic activity is a consequence, rather than a contributing factor, to conscious error awareness. It also suggests that changes to phasic autonomic activity is unlikely to explain increased error blindness in older age.",

      "title": "Timing Is Everything: Temporal Dynamics of BOLD Responses to Naturalistic Features in Movie Watching",
      "content": "Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies and narratives, are increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience to map cognitive and affective processes onto brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Features extracted from movies span multiple levels, from computational descriptions of visual and auditory input to physiological signals and subjective ratings. However, the temporal alignment between these features and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response can vary considerably, and the commonly used canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with temporal derivatives may not adequately capture these delays. In this study, we analyzed three movie-watching datasets and examined a range of features, including visual luminance and contrast, auditory pitch, a physiological measure of pupil size, and subjective ratings of theory of mind. We performed cross-correlation analyses between feature time series and fMRI responses across the whole brain. Our results show that the canonical HRF captures sensory features well but misaligns with slower signals such as pupil size and subjective ratings. Notably, raw pupil size and subjective ratings exhibited stronger correspondence with delayed hemodynamic responses. Lastly, we showed that video data can be used as continuous input to measure hemodynamic response functions across brain regions. These findings highlight the critical role of temporal alignment in mapping naturalistic features to brain activity. Accounting for feature-specific delays may improve the interpretability and accuracy of fMRI studies using complex, real-world stimuli.",

      "title": "The Effect of Musical Groove on Sensorimotor Network Cortical Dynamics during Active Tapping and Passive Listening",
      "content": "Musical groove, defined as the urge to move in response to rhythmic stimuli, drives spontaneous entrainment and engagement with music. Recent studies have investigated the activation of the sensorimotor network (SMN), focusing on the mu rhythm, an oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) ranges that reflects motor system engagement. While mu modulation differs between passive listening and active movement, it remains unclear whether these responses are shaped by the level of musical groove. Clarifying this relationship is crucial for understanding how neural oscillations transform rhythmic perception into embodied movement and how auditory and motor systems interact to generate the spontaneous urge to move. The present study investigates SMN dynamics by examining mu modulation across two factors: mode of engagement - active motor entrainment (finger tapping) versus passive listening, and groove level - low versus high. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were used to assess SMN activity, with a focus on mu rhythm modulation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Channel and cluster-based EEG analyses revealed stronger mu suppression during active tapping compared to passive listening, as well as an effect of musical groove. Self-reported groove ratings were not affected by the tapping task. Together, these findings highlight the modulation of the mu rhythm in the SMN, describing distinctive patterns of neural engagement during the experience of musical groove.",
