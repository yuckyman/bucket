      "title": "Human-aligned Quantification of Numerical Data",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.15723v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as \"quantums,\" which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of \"symbols\" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as \"human intuition.\" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the \"normalized centroid distance\" method derived from information compression perspective.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16266v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The maintenance of rail vehicles and infrastructure plays a critical role in reducing delays, preventing malfunctions, and ensuring the economic efficiency of rail transportation companies. Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered labeling interfaces tailored to annotators needs for Usability and User Experience. This study introduces a cost effective predictive maintenance system developed in the federally funded project DigiOnTrack, which combines structure borne noise measurement with supervised learning to provide monitoring and maintenance recommendations for rail vehicles and infrastructure in rural Germany. The system integrates wireless sensor networks, distributed ledger technology for secure data transfer, and a dockerized container infrastructure hosting the labeling interface and dashboard. Train drivers and workshop foremen labeled faults on infrastructure and vehicles to ensure accurate recommendations. The Usability and User Experience evaluation showed that the locomotive drivers interface achieved Excellent Usability, while the workshop foremans interface was rated as Good. These results highlight the systems potential for integration into daily workflows, particularly in labeling efficiency. However, areas such as Perspicuity require further optimization for more data intensive scenarios. The findings offer insights into the design of predictive maintenance systems and labeling interfaces, providing a foundation for future guidelines in Industry 4.0 applications, particularly in rail transportation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Comprehensively interpreting human behavior is a core challenge in human-aware artificial intelligence. However, prior works typically focused on body behavior, neglecting the crucial role of eye gaze and its synergy with body motion. We present GazeInterpreter - a novel large language model-based (LLM-based) approach that parses eye gaze data to generate eye-body-coordinated narrations. Specifically, our method features 1) a symbolic gaze parser that translates raw gaze signals into symbolic gaze events; 2) a hierarchical structure that first uses an LLM to generate eye gaze narration at semantic level and then integrates gaze with body motion within the same observation window to produce integrated narration; and 3) a self-correcting loop that iteratively refines the modality match, temporal coherence, and completeness of the integrated narration. This hierarchical and iterative processing can effectively align physical values and semantic text in the temporal and spatial domains. We validated the effectiveness of our eye-body-coordinated narrations on the text-driven motion generation task in the large-scale Nymeria benchmark. Moreover, we report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream tasks of action anticipation and behavior summarization. Taken together, these results reveal the significant potential of parsing eye gaze to interpret human behavior and open up a new direction for human behavior understanding.",

For a data scientist, it makes sense to plan the necessary experiments in the development of new compounds using Bayesian Optimization, an optimization approach based on a surrogate model that is known for its data efficiency and is therefore well suited for data obtained from costly experiments. Furthermore, if historical data and expert knowledge are available, their inclusion in the surrogate model is expected to accelerate the convergence of the optimization. In this article, we describe a use case in which the addition of data and knowledge has impaired optimization. We also describe the unsuccessful methods that were used to remedy the problem before we found the reasons for the poor performance and achieved a satisfactory result. We conclude with a lesson learned: additional knowledge and data are only beneficial if they do not complicate the underlying optimization goal.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16214v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People today are overwhelmed by massive amounts of information, leading to cognitive overload and memory burden. Traditional visual memory augmentation methods are either effortful and disruptive or fail to align with user intent. To address these limitations, we propose Gaze Archive, a novel visual memory enhancement paradigm through active logging on smart glasses. It leverages human gaze as a natural attention indicator, enabling both intent-precise capture and effortless-and-unobtrusive interaction. To implement Gaze Archive, we develop GAHMA, a technical framework that enables compact yet intent-aligned memory encoding and intuitive memory recall based on natural language queries. Quantitative experiments on our newly constructed GAVER dataset show that GAHMA achieves more intent-precise logging than non-gaze baselines. Through extensive user studies in both laboratory and real-world scenarios, we compare Gaze Archive with other existing memory augmentation methods. Results demonstrate its advantages in perceived effortlessness, unobtrusiveness and overall preference, showing strong potential for real-world deployment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16133v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Beyond a simple notification of incoming calls or messages, more complex information such as alphabets and digits can be delivered through spatiotemporal tactile patterns (STPs) on a wrist-worn tactile display (WTD) with multiple tactors. However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16038v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current text-to-image models struggle to render the nuanced facial expressions required for compelling manga narratives, largely due to the ambiguity of language itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce an interactive system built on a novel, dual-hybrid pipeline. The first stage combines landmark-based auto-detection with a manual framing tool for robust, artist-centric face preparation. The second stage maps expressions using the LivePortrait engine, blending intuitive performative input from video for fine-grained control. Our case study analysis suggests that this integrated workflow can streamline the creative process and effectively translate narrative intent into visual expression. This work presents a practical model for human-AI co-creation, offering artists a more direct and intuitive means of ``infusing souls'' into their characters. Our primary contribution is not a new generative model, but a novel, interactive workflow that bridges the gap between artistic intent and AI execution.",

Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.",

      "title": "Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2410.03972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions, a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks: flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration, while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to tune the variability of RNN solutions, either to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model the individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2507.05268v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the brain and external devices through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing decoding models often mix common and personalized components, leading to interference from individual variability that limits cross-subject decoding performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a system filter that extends the concept of signal filtering to the system level. The method expands a system into its spectral representation, selectively removes unnecessary components, and reconstructs the system from the retained target components, thereby achieving explicit system-level decomposition and filtering. We further integrate the system filter into a Cross-Subject Decoding framework based on the System Filter (CSD-SF) and evaluate it on the four-class motor imagery (MI) task of the BCIC IV 2a dataset. Personalized models are transformed into relation spectrums, and statistical testing across subjects is used to remove personalized components. The remaining stable relations, representing common components across subjects, are then used to construct a common model for cross-subject decoding. Experimental results show an average improvement of 3.28% in decoding accuracy over baseline methods, demonstrating that the proposed system filter effectively isolates stable common components and enhances model robustness and generalizability in cross-subject EEG decoding.",

      "title": "A Tripartite Framework for Understanding the Embodied Mind: A Comprehensive Review of Bodily Map Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2504.14865v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: People often speak of being \"moved beyond words\" when witnessing awe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or encountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely embodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a sudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult to articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily experience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which captures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the body. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite framework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up physiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor actions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we argue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring, but expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because they rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily maps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional experience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies, and clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable. Ultimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings that elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words, yet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how emotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.",

      "title": "Brain's Statistical Learning and its Embodied Mechanisms Towards Understanding Creativity and Individuality in Music",
      "content": "arXiv:2504.10875v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Music is a universal feature of human culture, linked to embodied cognitive functions that drive learning, action, and the emergence of creativity and individuality. Evidence highlights the critical role of statistical learning an implicit cognitive process of the brain in musical creativity and individuality. Despite its significance, the precise neural and computational mechanisms underpinning these dynamic and embodied cognitive processes re-main poorly understood. This paper discusses how individuality and creativity emerge within the framework of the brain's statistical learning, drawing on a series of neural and computational studies. This work offers perspectives on the mechanisms driving the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning abilities and embodied mechanisms and provides a framework to explain the paradoxical phenomenon where individuals with specific cognitive traits that limit certain perceptual abilities excel in creative domains.",

      "title": "Clarifying the conceptual dimensions of representation in neuroscience",
      "content": "arXiv:2403.14046v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Despite the centrality of the notion of representation in neuroscience, the field lacks a unified framework for the concepts used to characterize representation, leading to disparate use of both terminology and measures associated with representation. To offer clarification, we propose a core set of conceptual dimensions that characterize representations in neuroscience. These dimensions describe relations between a neural response, features that may be represented, and downstream effects of the neural response. A neural response may be shown to be sensitive and specific to a feature, invariant to other features, and functional, which means that it is used downstream in the brain. We use information-theoretic measures to introduce these conceptual dimensions unambiguously and explain how data analysis methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence or adaptation relate to our framework. We consider several canonical examples, including the representation of orientation, numerosity, and spatial location, which illustrate how the evidence put forth in support or criticism of representational conclusions is systematized by our framework. By offering a unified conceptual framework we hope to aid the comparison and integration of results across studies and research groups and to help determine when evidence for a representational conclusion is strong.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16465v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16432v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "Beat Frequency Induced Transitions in Synchronization Dynamics",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.15985v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In neurosciences, the brain processes information via the firing patterns of connected neurons operating across a spectrum of frequencies. To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",
