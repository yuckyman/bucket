      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

      "title": "Preserved Neural Dynamics across Arm- and Brain-controlled Movements",
      "content": "The neural response for motor control is complex and dynamic; it has been found to dramatically transit from planning to executing movements. As brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can directly connect the brain and the external world by yielding comparable motor outcomes with artificial apparatus, a central question remains whether the neural dynamics underlying brain-control movement share characteristics or mechanism in natural neural motor control. To enable a systematic comparison, we developed a feedforward BMI framework that enables rapid cursor control to intercept moving targets. This BMI allowed monkeys to voluntarily initiate neural states which controlled the direction and timing of a launched ballistic movement, like skeet shooting. Based on this, we found similar neural representation patterns and computational structure across brain- and arm-control conditions. Notably, in addition to resembling the rotational structure in natural reaching, the neural population dynamics during open loop control also shared preserved manifold with those during arm interception. These findings suggest a fundamental principle and reveal a set of basic computational motifs, for neural control of movement in an abstract hierarchy independent of constraints from actuators. This study thus has potential to reshape the consideration of how BMIs assist paralyzed patients in interacting with dynamic environments and promote next-generation BMI systems.",

      "title": "A non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid",
      "content": "The high relapse rates are major challenges in treating opioid addiction. However, it remains poorly understood the mechanisms underlying long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Here, we identify the cortico-subthalamic projection from the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) to the zona incerta (ZI) as a key circuit for controlling relapse to opioid. We uncover that an ensemble of RSG glutamatergic neurons that locate in layer 5 and express B subtype cholecystokinin receptor (RSGGlu-Cckbr ensemble) are critically implicated in the encoding and retrieval of opioid-associated memories, leading to relapse to opioid via innervating ZI GABAergic (ZIGABA) rather than dopaminergic neurons. We further identify that the Cckergic neurons from anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (AD thalamus) orchestrates RSGGlu-Cckbr-ZIGABA circuit function via release of cholecystokinin (Cck) in RSG. These results elucidate a previously unknown non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid and shed new light on the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat relapse to opioids.",

      "title": "\u201cPICS\u201d: a novel patient-specific landmark for thalamic surgical interventions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal",
      "content": "IntroductionDifficulties in direct visualization of thalamic subnuclei are likely a contributor to inconsistent surgical outcomes among patients with medication refractory tremors. We present a new MRI landmark, represented by a bright signal in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal (PICS), that can serve as a consistent marker for indirect location of the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We evaluated the visibility of PICS across multiple MRI sequences at 7Tesla (T) and 3T, and its anatomical characteristics were identified using tractography.MethodsOne healthy control and 15 essential tremor (ET) patients were scanned. To characterize the PICS fibers, two posterior limb of internal capsule (pLIC) tractography schemes were conducted with cortical ROIs as seeds and the pLIC as a waypoint: (i) gross motor cortical ROIs, (ii) M1 and S1 homunculus. Finally, intra- and post-operative clinical data were merged for one ET DBS patient to show correspondence between the parcellation results and clinical observations.ResultsPICS was consistently identified across multiple MRI sequences. Tractography analyses identified PICS to correlate with the distribution of motor fibers from the internal capsule. For the M1 homunculus, two somatotopic clusters were observed: one including mostly trunk, lower and upper limbs; and another, more anteriorly, with head/face clustering with tongue/larynx. For the S1 homunculus, the trunk region was overall the most posterior region followed by the upper limb/face anteriorly and Area2. Intra-operative stimulation at two different depths resulted in pLIC-specific side effect in the tongue/face. At those depths, measurements showed closer proximity of the DBS electrode to M1 clusters of head/face and tongue/larynx, validating the imaging findings.ConclusionPICS appears to be a reliable radiological marker comprising cortico-spinal tracts, in isolation from corticobulbar tracts fibers. It is consistently located lateral to the Vim, making it a potential landmark to infer Vim location and help refine targeting for thalamic procedures. The parcellations of the pLIC using M1 homunculus could potentially inform lead or ablation location based on side effect profiles (e.g., head/face/tongue vs. trunk/limbs). Therefore, proximity or distance to PICS may potentially guide lead placement to avoid procedure-related capsular side effects while optimizing benefits.",

      "title": "Post-stroke seizures in animal models: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundPost-stroke seizures (PSS) are a common complication of stroke and can exacerbate neurological injury, yet their study in preclinical models remains limited. Understanding the relationship between PSS and outcomes in animal models is critical for improving translational research and informing therapeutic strategies.ObjectiveTo systematically review and meta-analyze the incidence, consequences, and methodological quality of studies investigating PSS in animal models of ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsA systematic search of Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science (June 2024, updated May 2025) identified original, peer-reviewed animal studies published after 1999 that reported seizures and outcomes (lesion volume, neurological deficit scores, behavior, edema, inflammation) without interventional treatments. Data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed for lesion volume.ResultsOf 6,005 studies screened, 10 met inclusion criteria, with eight eligible for meta-analysis. Seizure incidence ranged from 17.5\u201382% in focal ischemia and 45\u201367% in ICH models. Lesion volume was the most commonly measured outcome. Meta-analysis revealed that seizures were associated with larger lesion volumes in focal ischemia models (Hedge\u2019s G\u202f=\u202f1.598, p\u202f=\u202f0.038) but not in ICH models (Hedge\u2019s G\u202f=\u202f0.180, p\u202f=\u202f0.468). Across studies, seizures were linked to more severe neurological deficits in focal ischemia but showed no consistent effect in ICH. Risk-of-bias assessment indicated high risk in all studies, with frequent methodological limitations including lack of random outcome assessment, use of only young male animals, and absence of a priori sample size calculations. Publication bias was suggested by funnel plot asymmetry.ConclusionThis review highlights a scarcity of rigorous preclinical studies on PSS, substantial heterogeneity across animal models, and methodological limitations that hinder translatability. Findings suggest a differential impact of stroke type on seizure outcomes, with focal ischemia-associated seizures linked to larger lesions and poorer neurological function. Future research should employ long-term, rigorously designed studies using diverse animal populations, standardized seizure monitoring, and careful reporting to enhance clinical relevance and guide therapeutic development.",

      "content": "BackgroundApolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 (\u03b54) is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), with women exhibiting heightened vulnerability to APOE \u03b54-associated cognitive impairment. Despite recognition of this sexual dimorphism, the underlying biological mechanisms remain incompletely understood.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on RNA-seq data from the Mayo Clinic cohort (n\u202f=\u202f277 temporal cortex samples) to identify sex- and APOE \u03b54-linked co-expression modules. 315 hub genes were identified within the most relevant gene modules derived from female AD patients with APOE \u03b54. The expression patterns of representative hub genes were then validated in female APOE \u03b54 carriers. Causal genes were prioritized via Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), and diagnostic biomarkers were identified using machine learning. Single-cell RNA-seq elucidated cell-type-specific gene expression, and Connectivity Map (CMap) screening nominated candidate therapeutics validated in a tauopathy mouse model (AAV-hTau-injected APP/PS1 mice).ResultsFour co-expression modules (tan, blue2, grey60, antiquewhite4) specifically correlated with female AD patients with APOE \u03b54-positive and were enriched for vascular endothelial development and extracellular matrix pathways. Ten hub genes were implicated in the pathogenesis of female-specific APOE \u03b54 AD. LAMC1, RBMS2, TMOD3, and LRP10 were suggested as key drivers of AD progression associated with endothelial dysfunction. Single-cell analysis confirmed endothelial-specific upregulation of these genes in female APOE \u03b54 AD brains. Drug repositioning nominated the vasodilator vincamine, which downregulated Lrp10, Lamc1 in cortex tissue, and effectively inhibited the tau protein propagation from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus in female AD mice.Conclusionwe reveal a female-specific APOE \u03b54-driven molecular network linking endothelial dysfunction to tau pathology. These hub genes provide potential biomarkers, while vincamine represents a targeted prevention and therapeutic candidate for high-risk APOE \u03b54-positive women.",

      "content": "ObjectiveOne of the most challenging aims of the scientific community in the last decade, is to find an easily accessible matrix in which neurodegeneration-related biomarkers can be measured and used to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in vivo. Blood biomarkers have led the way in this regard, specifically, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) which demonstrates excellent diagnostic and prognostic properties. The recent success of the blood biomarkers for AD pathophysiology poses a new question \u2013 can p-tau be measured in other peripheral and even more accessible biofluids, and do they have relation to disease? Saliva contains biomarkers linked to neurodegeneration and it has been proposed as a potential sample type that would be minimally invasive to collect for this purpose.MethodsIn this study, we confirmed the presence of several p-tau species in saliva fluid and saliva gland tissue by Immunoprecipitation-Mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Furthermore, we measured saliva and plasma p-tau181 concentrations in 125 memory clinic participants, using ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) technology.ResultsDespite a weak correlation between saliva p-tau181 and CSF t-tau (rho\u202f=\u202f0.13, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), there were no significant differences in saliva p-tau181 concentration between the different clinical groups and the healthy controls.InterpretationFor this reason, we conclude that saliva p-tau181 is not acceptable as a biomarker for AD.",

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.
