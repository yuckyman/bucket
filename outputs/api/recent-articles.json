      "title": "Infraslow histaminergic dynamics govern priming states to gate moment-to-moment memory accessibility",
      "content": "Memory expression fluctuates even in response to identical cues, suggesting that ongoing brain states bias memory accessibility. However, the cellular and circuit principles governing these state-dependent fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous pre-cue activity of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) modulates the expression of reward-associative memory in mice. TMN histaminergic activity exhibited infraslow dynamics (0.05-0.1 Hz) that closely tracked an integrated brain-body state. Closed-loop cue delivery during high histaminergic states enhanced memory expression. Brief optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons before the cue bidirectionally modulated memory expression, and direct activation of histaminergic terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to enhance memory expression. Furthermore, histaminergic inhibition before the cue impaired the cue-evoked BLA population response. Thus, ongoing histaminergic activity exerts an infraslow, state-setting influence that primes BLA circuits for robust cue responses, and in turn, modulates moment-to-moment memory accessibility.",

      "title": "Decoding hidden goal-directed navigational states and their neuronal representations using a novel labyrinth paradigm and probabilistic modeling framework",
      "content": "Goal-directed navigation involves a sequence of planned actions aimed at achieving long-term goals through reinforcement, but detecting hidden states that support this process and their neuronal substrates remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we developed a complex labyrinth test that mimics naturalistic foraging and implemented a novel hierarchical probabilistic modeling framework, Cognitive Mapping of Planned Actions with State Spaces (CoMPASS). This framework infers a nested state structure, comprising short-term surveillance and ambulation states (Level 1) and long-term goal-oriented navigational states (Level 2). Using CoMPASS, we show that successful navigation in wild-type mice is marked by increased recruitment of both surveillance and goal-oriented states specifically at decision nodes, revealing how sequential behavioral decisions culminate in long-term goals. In contrast, the humanized AppSAA mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited navigational impairments marked by diminished surveillance during decisions, reduced goal-directed states, and increased navigation stochasticity. Importantly, we show that gamma oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved in spatial navigation planning, encode these CoMPASS behavioral states and their dynamic operating modes linking spatial locations to long-term goals. Our findings provide a novel paradigm for assessing hidden goal-directed navigational states and identify gamma oscillations in the PPC as their neural substrates.",

      "title": "Simultaneous stomach-brain electrophysiology reveals dynamic coupling in human sleep",
      "content": "Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral signals during human sleep remain poorly understood. Here we tested whether gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms indicative of sleep physiology. Simultaneous high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and electrogastrography (EGG) were recorded across sixty participants and three nights. Gastric power was consistently higher during NREM than REM sleep and declined across successive cycles, consistent with stage-dependent autonomic modulation of visceral activity. For the first time, we show that the gastric rhythm itself exhibits intrinsic infraslow amplitude modulations (~0.007 Hz), which are selectively amplified during NREM sleep and temporally aligned with infraslow fluctuations in cortical sigma power, strongest during N3 sleep. Event-locked analyses further revealed transient increases in gastric amplitude following cortical slow wave oscillations, particularly when accompanied by sleep spindles. Across nights, variance in gastric infraslow amplitude predicted subjective sleep quality beyond standard polysomnographic and cardiac measures. Together, these findings position the human stomach as a peripheral oscillator whose infraslow dynamics track thalamocortical activity during sleep and predict subjective sleep quality, extending the interoceptive regulatory loop into the sleeping brain.",

      "content": "A central challenge in overcoming diseases resulting from defects in the cellular nanoscale multiprotein porosome complexes, is the consequent alteration of other proteins within the complex. By exploiting the distinct porosomes present in different tissues, Porosome Therapeutics, Inc., has developed a clinically relevant approach to incorporate (reconstitute) functional wild type porosomes into the plasma membrane of diseased cells to overcome secretory defects. In a combinatorial strategy of reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic components, we established a dual-target therapeutic framework that repairs synaptic and metabolic defects to counteract neurodegeneration in Alzheimers. Utilizing iPSC derived human brain organoids, as recommended by the NIH and FDA, we demonstrate both the morphological and functional reversal of Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin treatment. Using the UHD-CMOS-MEA System developed jointly by Sony Semiconductor Solutions (Sony), SCREEN Holdings (SCREEN) and VitroVo, we were able to monitor thousands of neuronal firing in the brain organoids, helping in assessing the restoration of neuronal function in Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin therapy.",

      "title": "Contrast and pattern adaptation in visual cortex share a common gain control mechanism",
      "content": "Neuronal populations in primary visual cortex adjust their responses to the statistical structure of the environment, including both stimulus contrast and the probability of occurrence of visual patterns. Here we show that, across a wide range of adaptation states, the distribution of population responses is well described by a zero-inflated log-normal model with three parameters: the probability of \"silence\" P0, the log-response mean , and its variance {sigma}2. Adaptation produces coordinated changes in P0 and , whereas {sigma}2 remains approximately invariant. These coordinated shifts collapse the family of response distributions onto a one-dimensional manifold, consistent with the existence of a common gain mechanism underlying both contrast and pattern adaptation. We further demonstrate that  obeys power-law relationships with stimulus contrast and with orientation probability, and that P0 varies linearly with . Finally, we show that these empirical relations arise naturally in a population of linear-nonlinear neurons driven by Gaussian inputs whose mean, but not variance, is modulated by the environment. Together, these results suggest that contrast and pattern adaptation rely on a shared mechanism that adjusts the mean input to cortical populations while preserving the overall structure of their response distribution.",

      "title": "The retinal light response is modulated by an mGluR5-mediated retrograde signal from ON-bipolar cells to photoreceptors",
      "content": "The ON visual pathway is initiated by the deactivation of mGluR6, coupled to the opening of TRPM1 channels in retinal ON-bipolar cell dendrites. Here, we show that a second metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is localized with TRPM1 and mGluR6 in the dendrites of ON-bipolar cells. To examine the function of mGluR5, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that the amplitude of the b-wave, which is primarily a measure of ON-bipolar cell light-driven activity, is reduced in mGluR5 knock-out mice compared to wild type. In the mGluR5-/- retina, we observed weaker mGluR6 immunofluorescence in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells that could explain the smaller ERG b-wave. To observe the effect of mGluR5 without perturbing mGluR6 expression, wild type mice were injected with MTEP, an allosteric antagonist of mGluR5. MTEP increased the amplitude of the b-wave in response to dim stimuli and caused an inflection in the intensity-response plot for flashes in the mesopic range. In the brain, postsynaptic mGluR5 regulates presynaptic glutamate release via endocanabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Therefore, we tested the effect of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR1417A, on the ERG and found that the b-wave was affected as by MTEP, including an inflection in the intensity-response. We further showed that the CB1 receptor agonist, ACEA, reversed the effects of MTEP. Together, our results indicate that mGluR5 plays a role in gain-control at the photoreceptor to ON-bipolar cell synapses, likely via an endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde feedback.",

      "title": "Identification of gingipains in glioblastoma tumors and evidence that P. gingivalis infection drives IL-6 and PD-L1 expression in glioma cells",
      "content": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor that accounts for approximately 60% of all gliomas and 48% of primary central nervous system malignancies, is incurable and poorly understood, with a median survival of only 15 months after diagnosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand GBM pathogenesis in order to develop an effective treatment. Recent research has revealed frequent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brains of patients with GBM, i.e., amyloid beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), indicating that GBM and AD may share some unknown environmental risk. Since chronic periodontitis (CP), and specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone bacterial pathogen in CP, have emerged as risk factors for both AD and GBM, we investigated whether P. gingivalis gingipain virulence factors could be identified in GBM tissue samples and whether P. gingivalis infection affects glioma cell behavior. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (70 GBM cores from 35 patients; 34 cerebral tissue cores from 17 patients), we quantified the presence of arginine-gingipain B (RgpB) and lysine-gingipain (Kgp) antigens. Both gingipains showed significantly elevated staining in GBM samples compared to controls (**p < .01, ****p < .0001, respectively), with Kgp levels notably higher than RgpB within GBM tissue (****p < .0001). In functional assays using U251 glioma cells, P. gingivalis infection induced robust, dose-dependent IL-6 secretion (peaking at MOI 5), increased PD-L1 expression by 30% (*p = .036), and significantly enhanced cell invasiveness (**p < .01) in a viability-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that P. gingivalis gingipains are present at elevated levels in GBM tissue and that P. gingivalis infection reprograms glioma cells to adopt an immunosuppressive, invasive phenotype through upregulation of the IL-6/PD-L1 axis, suggesting a potential microbial contribution to GBM pathogenesis and immune evasion.",

How do we provide developers the means to impose arbitrary constraints in the configs under the same framework?).</li> <li>Uniformity (Ideally, we'd have a uniform API for users to create any config, and for developers to template them).</li> <li>Explicit (It should be clear where the configurable parameters are used within the program).</li> <li>Shared parameters, different defaults (Different radios share configurable parameters, but require different defaults. If I've got ten different configs, I don't want to maintain ten copies of the same parameter just to update one value!).</li> <li>Statically typed (Always a bonus!).</li> </ul> <p>Initially, with some difficulty, I made a custom implementation which was servicable but cumbersome. Over the past year, I had a nagging feeling I was reinventing the wheel. I was correct.</p> <p>I recently merged <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/pull/62\">a PR</a> which replaced my custom implementation with one which used pydantic. Enlightenment! It satisfied all the requirements:</p> <ul> <li>We now define a model which templates the config right next to where those configurable parameters are used in the program (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/flowgraphs/_signal_generator.py#L15-L51\">here</a>).</li> <li>Arbitrary relationships between parameters are enforced in the same way for every config with the validator decorator pattern (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/models/_signal_generator.py#L14-L49\">here</a>). </li> <li>We can share pydantic fields between configs, and update the defaults as required using the annotated pattern (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/fields/_fields.py\">here</a>).</li> <li>The same framework is used for templating all the configs in the program, and it's all statically typed!</li> </ul> <p>Anyway, check out <em>Spectre</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre\">on GitHub</a> if you're interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jcfitzpatrick12\"> /u/jcfitzpatrick12 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ox9cct/pydantic_and_the_path_to_enlightenment/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ox9cct/pydantic_and_the_path_to_enlightenment/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Assumption Lean Community Detection Methods for Human Connectome Networks",
      "content": "Community detection provides a principled lens on mesoscale organization in functional brain networks, yet many widely used methods presume assortative structure and depend on arbitrary thresholding, which complicates the selection of the community count K. We conducted a systematic benchmark of three assumption lean approaches that operate directly on weighted functional connectivity matrices: the Weighted Stochastic Block Model, Spectral Clustering, and K-means. Performance was assessed on synthetic networks with known ground truth and on three neuroimaging cohorts spanning development, namely the Human Connectome Project, Washington University 120, and the Baby Connectome Project. We compared strategies for choosing K, including post hoc indices such as silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C index, modularity, variation of information, Normalized Mutual Information, and zRand, together with a likelihood-based criterion for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model that uses bootstrap confidence intervals for differences in log likelihood between successive values of K. In simulations all methods recovered stable partitions, but the post hoc indices favored incorrect values of K under weak signal and nonassortative mixing. In adult datasets the indices do not yield a unique optimum, whereas the likelihood-based criterion selects a parsimonious range centered near K=11, which is consistent with established sensory and association systems. In infants and toddlers, the same procedure supports a larger K around 15 and reveals developmentally distinct mesoscale architecture, including anterior and posterior subdivisions within default mode and fronto parietal systems. A consensus relabeling scheme based on Hungarian matching with Hamming distance further stabilizes solutions across runs and across values of K. Overall, threshold free weighted methods mitigate assortative bias and the likelihood-based comparison provides a reproducible path to selecting K.",
