If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>[This is my 2nd attempt at a post here; dear moderators, I am not an AI! ... at least I don't think I am ]</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ace0278/generate-openai-style-embeddings-locally-with-minilm-adapter-f43ec9c3b7da\">EmbeddingAdapters </a>is a Python library for translating between embedding model vector spaces.</p> <p>It provides plug-and-play adapters that map embeddings produced by one model into the vector space of another \u2014 locally or via provider APIs \u2014 enabling cross-model retrieval, routing, interoperability, and migration <strong>without re-embedding an existing corpus</strong>.</p> <p>If a vector index is already built using one embedding model, embedding-adapters allows it to be queried using another, without rebuilding the index.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Anyone who is a developer or startup, if you have a mobile app and you want to run ultra fast on-device RAG with provider level quality, use this. If you want to save money on embeddings over millions of queries, use this. If you want to sample embedding spaces you don't have access to - gemini mongo etc. - use this.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> There is no comparable library that specializes in this</p> <p><strong>Why I Made This:</strong> This solved a serious pain point for me, but I also realized that we could extend it greatly as a community. Each time a new model is added to the library, it permits a new connection\u2014you can effectively walk across different model spaces. Chain these adapters together and you can do some really interesting things.</p> <p>For example, you could go from OpenAI \u2192 MiniLM (you may not think you want to do that, but consider the cost savings of being able to interact with MiniLM embeddings as if they were OpenAI).</p> <p>I know this doesn\u2019t sound possible, but it is. The adapters reinterpret the semantic signals already present in these models. It won\u2019t work for every input text, but by pairing each adapter with a confidence score, you can effectively route between a provider and a local model. This cuts costs dramatically and significantly speeds up query embedding generation.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/\">https://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/EmbeddingAdapters/</a></p> <p><strong>PyPI:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/embedding-adapters/\">https://pypi.org/project/embedding-adapters/</a></p> <h1>Example</h1> <p>Generate an OpenAI embedding locally from minilm+adapter:</p> <pre><code>pip install embedding-adapters embedding-adapters embed \\ --source sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \\ --target openai/text-embedding-3-small \\ --flavor large \\ --text &quot;where are restaurants with a hamburger near me&quot; </code></pre> <p>The command returns:</p> <ul> <li>an embedding in the target (OpenAI) space</li> <li>a confidence / quality score estimating adapter reliability</li> </ul> <h1>Model Input</h1> <p>At inference time, the adapter\u2019s <strong>only input is an embedding vector</strong> from a source model.<br /> No text, tokens, prompts, or provider embeddings are used.</p> <p>A pure <strong>vector \u2192 vector</strong> mapping is sufficient to recover most of the retrieval behavior of larger proprietary embedding models for in-domain queries.</p> <h1>Benchmark results</h1> <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> SQuAD (8,000 Q/A pairs)</p> <p><strong>Latency (answer embeddings):</strong></p> <ul> <li>MiniLM embed: <strong>1.08 s</strong></li> <li>Adapter transform: <strong>0.97 s</strong></li> <li>OpenAI API embed: <strong>40.29 s</strong></li> </ul> <p>\u2248 <strong>70\u00d7 faster</strong> for local MiniLM + adapter vs OpenAI API calls.</p> <p><strong>Retrieval quality (Recall@10):</strong></p> <ul> <li>MiniLM \u2192 MiniLM: <strong>10.32%</strong></li> <li>Adapter \u2192 Adapter: <strong>15.59%</strong></li> <li>Adapter \u2192 OpenAI: <strong>16.93%</strong></li> <li>OpenAI \u2192 OpenAI: <strong>18.26%</strong></li> </ul> <p>Bootstrap difference (OpenAI \u2212 Adapter \u2192 OpenAI): <strong>~1.34%</strong></p> <p>For in-domain queries, the MiniLM \u2192 OpenAI adapter recovers ~<strong>93%</strong> of OpenAI retrieval performance and substantially outperforms MiniLM-only baselines.</p> <h1>How it works (high level)</h1> <p>Each adapter is trained on a <strong>restricted domain</strong>, allowing it to specialize in interpreting the semantic signals of smaller models and projecting them into higher-dimensional provider spaces while preserving retrieval-relevant structure.</p> <p>A quality score is provided to determine whether an input is well-covered by the adapter\u2019s training distribution.</p> <h1>Practical uses in Python applications</h1> <ul> <li>Query an existing vector index built with one embedding model using another</li> <li>Operate mixed vector indexes and route queries to the most effective embedding space</li> <li>Reduce cost and latency by embedding locally for in-domain queries</li> <li>Evaluate embedding providers before committing to a full re-embed</li> <li>Gradually migrate between embedding models</li> <li>Handle provider outages or rate limits gracefully</li> <li>Run RAG pipelines in air-gapped or restricted environments</li> <li>Maintain a stable \u201ccanonical\u201d embedding space while changing edge models</li> </ul> <h1>Supported adapters</h1> <ul> <li>MiniLM \u2194 OpenAI</li> <li>OpenAI \u2194 Gemini</li> <li>E5 \u2194 MiniLM</li> <li>E5 \u2194 OpenAI</li> <li>E5 \u2194 Gemini</li> <li>MiniLM \u2194 Gemini</li> </ul> <p>The project is under active development, with ongoing work on additional adapter pairs, domain specialization, evaluation tooling, and training efficiency.</p> <p>Please Like/Upvote</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting-Town-433\"> /u/Interesting-Town-433 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlx02c/generate_openai_embeddings_locally_with_minilm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlx02c/generate_openai_embeddings_locally_with_minilm/\">[comments]</a></span>",
