      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "The impact of unemployment on dream content.",
      "content": "This study examines the relationship between employment status and dream content using a data set of 6,478 dream reports collected from Reddit. We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

      "title": "From falling apart to disturbing dreams: A preliminary examination of self-fragmentation and nightmares.",
      "content": "Previous theory suggested a relationship between fragmentation of the self-structure and nightmares. This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

If you're interested\nin seeing all minor changes you can follow our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/commits/main\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub or\n<a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Updates Channel</a> in Discord.</p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"wiki-updates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Wiki Updates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#wiki-updates\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reorganized <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/downloading#download-sites\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download Sites</a>, retested each, bumped ones with faster hosts higher, moved any that fit other sections better, removed dead or premium-only, and fixed inaccurate labels. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/B2kJ23O.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Before vs. After</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reorganized <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/educational#programming-languages\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Learning</a>, removed outdated sites, and fixed bad formatting.  <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1ozRI.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Before vs. After</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reworked all our VPN + Proxy sections. There was too much to fit into a &quot;before vs after&quot; image, but you can see all of the changes in the <a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/pull/4108/files\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pull request</a> by Wispy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed formatting in <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/mobile#android-camera\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android Camera Tools</a>, turned it into its own head section, and added new subsections for <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/mobile#image-tools\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Image Editing</a> + <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/mobile#image-galleries\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Image Galleries</a> to make it easier to navigate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added PWA (Progressive Web App) support to our website. This means our site can be added to your home screen or desktop like an app. It can (in theory) allow a smoother experience when browsing the site. For mobile it may prompt, or you can add it by selecting <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JgyjqBI.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Add to Home Screen&quot;</a>. For desktop, simply hit the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gcu8r0U.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA icon</a> in the address bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated Windscribe's description to &quot;No Torrenting w/ Free Version&quot; as they can no longer <a href=\"https://redd.it/1nos1a9\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">afford to keep it running</a>. We've also bumped it below Proton, as Proton is unlimited despite having the same no torrent limitation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"stars-added-\u2b50\" tabindex=\"-1\">Stars Added \u2b50 <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#stars-added-\u2b50\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Starred new <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/mobile#ios-sideloading\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sideloading Guide</a> in iOS section. This is more up to date than ios.cfw's now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/downloading#software-sites\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virgil Software Search</a> in Software Sites. Custom multi-site software search engine, only uses trusted sites already listed on FMHY.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/ai#official-model-sites\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kimi</a> in AI Chatbots. Good free limits, highest rated open-source model on LMArena, adding K2 reasoning soon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/ai#specialized-chatbots\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LMArena Search</a> in Specialized Chatbots. Unlimited, shows all sources, has good search options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/reading#manga\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kagane</a> in Manhwa / Manga. Big library, no compression, nice UI, can toggle SFW / NSFW.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/reading#tracking-database\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MangaBaka</a> in Manga / Light Novel Tracking. Has expansive, detailed database, and nice UI, seems to be well liked so far.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/file-tools#file-hosts\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VikingFile</a> in File Hosts. Fast, unlimited size, files last 15 days (after last download). Seems to be used by lots of sites now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/misc#shopping\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Rights Wiki</a> in Shopping section. In-depth wiki that documents practices that impact consumer rights. Founded by Louis Rossmann.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-starred <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/gaming#rom-sites\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vimm's Lair</a> as they've recovered a lot of content that had been deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-Starred Firehawk52 as it's fully functionating again.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"things-removed\" tabindex=\"-1\">Things Removed <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#things-removed\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed Comick as they had to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/s/NInzfJ7GUK\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remove all of their content</a>. Such a huge amount of material, both popular, and obscure, has been ripped from the internet. Truly unfortunate. They will be very missed. Thank you to Comick for all the years of making peoples lives better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed ReVanced in Android Audio as it <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/revanced-complies-with-spotify-takedown-but-explores-options-to-fight-back/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">no longer blocks spotify ads</a>, and instead moved it to YouTube Music, as it still works fine for that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed Canva Pro telegram invite, it's gone and we don't have a new link for it. That was our last working Canva Pro method, so it might be awhile before we find an alt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unstarred Cobalt (in audio ripping, not video) as it's soundcloud + newgrounds only, making it less useful than it was.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unstarred Koalageddon in DLC unlockers, as v1/v2 are both archived and no longer updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
