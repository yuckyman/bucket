      "title": "Facial Micro-Movements as a Proxy of Increasingly Erratic Heart Rate Variability While Experiencing Pressure Pain",
      "content": "The sensation of pain varies from person to person. These patterns of individual variations are difficult to capture using coarse subjective self-reports. However, they are important when prescribing therapies and tailoring them to the person 's own sensations. Pain can be experienced differently by the same person, and fluctuate differently depending on the context, yet most analyses treat the problem under a one-size-fits-all model. In this work, we introduce a series of assays to objectively assess pressure pain across tasks with different motoric and cognitive demands, in relation to resting state. In a cohort of healthy individuals, we examine pain-free vs. pain states at rest, during drawing with heavy cognitive demands, during pointing to a visual target, and during a grooved peg task like inserting a grooved key in a matching grooved keyhole. We recorded face videos, electrocardiographic signals and adopt a standardized data type called the micro-movement spikes (MMS) to characterize the biorhythmic activities of the face micro-expressions and of the micro-fluctuations in the heart 's inter beat interval timings. Using the MMS peaks, we find that the continuous Gamma family of probability distribution functions best fit the frequency histograms of both the Face and the heart data. Further, we find that the Gamma shape and scale parameters in both signals span a scaling power law whereby as the noise-to-signal ratio (Gamma scale parameter) increases, so does the randomness of the stochastic process (the Gamma shape decreases towards the memoryless exponential range). We find that as the heart IBI turns more erratic (noisier and more random) the facial ophthalmic region increases the noise and randomness too, with higher linear correlation for tasks requiring haptic feedback (R2 0.84) than for tasks requiring higher cognitive and memory loads (R2 0.77). Increases in transfer entropy shows that recent past activity (~167ms back) of the heart IBI and Face combined lower the uncertainty in the prediction of the present ophthalmic-Face activity, suggesting that this Face region may serve as a proxy of an increasingly dysregulated heart. These results bear implications for the detection and monitoring of pressure pain and heart dysregulated states.",

      "title": "Permethrin elicits chemoreceptive responses on different Anopheles gambiae sensory appendages.",
      "content": "Non-contact detection of pyrethroid insecticides by malaria mosquitoes has been unveiled and may contribute to the evolution of mosquito behavioral modifications against vector control tools. However, the mechanisms underlying this detection are not yet fully understood. It has been hypothesized that the spatial repellency of pyrethroids may be mediated by chemosensory receptors and/or via the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). This study aimed to explore these two hypotheses by identifying which chemosensory appendages in Anopheles gambiae are involved in the non-contact detection of permethrin, a widely used pyrethroid in malaria control. Behavioral responses to permethrin headspace were recorded in female An. gambiae, in which specific sensory appendages were either removed or coated with resin to impair their chemosensory function. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings were performed on different sensory appendages: antennae, palpi and tarsi, to characterize their electrophysiological activity after permethrin stimulation. The behavioral assays revealed that tarsi were primarily responsible for mediating mosquito takeoff responses after permethrin headspace delivery. This finding was supported by significant electrophysiological tarsal responses to the insecticide. In contrast, removal of the antennae did not alter behavioral responses, although electroantennogram recordings indicated neural activity in response to permethrin. Palps showed neither behavioral nor electrophysiological responses. These findings indicate that permethrin is detected through two distinct sensory appendages, tarsi and antennae, but with varying behavioral output. Such appendage-specific detection favors the hypothesis that permethrin detection and the associated behavioral output is mediated by chemosensory receptors rather than by VGSCs. Nonetheless, further investigations are needed to identify the chemosensory receptors and pathways involved in pyrethroid insecticide detection in malaria mosquitoes.",

      "title": "Axon termination of the SAB motor neurons in C. elegans depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity",
      "content": "Axon termination is a critical step in neural circuit formation, but the contribution of activity from postsynaptic targets to this process remains unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans SAB neurons as a model system, we showed that inhibition of muscle activity during a critical period of postembryonic development led to axonal overgrowth and ectopic synapse formation. This effect is mediated by a local retrograde signal and requires neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) acting cell-autonomously to constrain axon growth. Manipulating SAB neuron excitability demonstrated that increased intrinsic neuronal activity drives overgrowth, while reducing activity suppresses it, establishing a functional link between muscle-derived cues and presynaptic excitability. Transcriptomic analysis and genetic studies further implicate the neuropeptides FLP-18 and NLP-12 as essential modulators of this activity-dependent process. Our findings reveal a temporally and spatially restricted retrograde signaling mechanism in motor neurons, where target activity, neuronal calcium dynamics and neuropeptide signaling cooperate to ensure proper axon termination. These results highlight conserved principles of activity-dependent regulation at neuromuscular junctions and provide a framework for understanding how motor circuits integrate target feedback to sculpt precise connectivity.",

      "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

      "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
      "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

      "title": "Akkermansia muciniphila in neurological disorders: mechanisms and therapeutic potential via the gut-brain axis",
      "content": "In recent years, the role of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in neurological diseases has attracted increasing attention. As a probiotic, A. muciniphila is closely associated with host health, metabolism, and immunity, demonstrating therapeutic potential in various conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and liver disorders. In the context of neurological diseases, A. muciniphila significantly influences the host brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA). This review summarizes the roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila and its active components (e.g., the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, extracellular vesicles AmEVs, and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs) in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), depression, cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy (EP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It exerts protective effects by enhancing the intestinal barrier, regulating lipid metabolism, producing SCFAs, secreting neuroactive substances, and inhibiting neuroinflammation, thereby suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders. However, due to limited data from large-scale human clinical trials and the complexity of disease mechanisms and host\u2013microbiota interactions, its clinical translation faces considerable challenges. Future efforts should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials and in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing technologies such as metabolomics to facilitate evidence-based clinical application.",

      "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
      "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

      "title": "Prognostic impact of collateral circulation in direct thrombectomy versus bridging thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion: a retrospective comparative study",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the prognostic impact of collateral circulation on outcomes of direct thrombectomy (DT) versus bridging thrombectomy (BT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO).MethodThis retrospective study included 460 AIS patients with anterior circulation LVO who underwent either DT (n\u202f=\u202f220) or BT (n\u202f=\u202f240). Collateral status was assessed using multiphase computed tomographic angiography. The primary outcome was functional prognosis at 3\u202fmonths, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Prognostic factors for good prognosis (90-day mRS\u202f\u2264\u202f2) and adverse events were identified through multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.ResultsThe BT group had significantly higher rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation compared to the DT group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Good collateral circulation was independently associated with good prognosis and lower risk of serious adverse events (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lower NIHSS scores, shorter OTR, absence of atrial fibrillation, and lower serum BNP levels were also significantly associated with favorable outcomes in AIS patients (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Elevated serum BNP levels increased the risk of serious adverse events in both DT and BT groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ROC analysis showed that a combined model including NIHSS, BNP, collateral circulation, onset-to-reperfusion time, and atrial fibrillation achieved high predictive performance for good prognosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.907, 95% CI: 0.881\u20130.934, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).ConclusionCollateral circulation is a strong predictor of both functional recovery and risk of adverse events in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, regardless of treatment strategy. While serum BNP may offer additional prognostic value, its moderate performance and overlap with cardiovascular conditions suggest that it should be interpreted cautiously. Pre-intervention collateral assessment remains a valuable tool for guiding individualized treatment decisions.",
