      "title": "Pheromone circuits and transcriptional cascades modulating transcriptional and chromatin states in the Drosophila central brain with social experience",
      "content": "Social experience significantly influences the behavioral and physiological responses of animals, including humans. In many animals, social isolation increases aggression, courtship, locomotion, and feeding while disrupting sleep. This occurs when peripheral neurons detect social signals, such as pheromones, which activate decision-making circuits in the brain. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms of how chronic social isolation or enrichment alter gene expression and affect neuronal function and behavior remain unclear. In this study, we examined how transcription patterns and chromatin marks in male Drosophila brains change in response to social experience, and the impact of pheromone circuits and transcription factors involved in social circuit function. We focused on pheromone receptors Or47b and Or67d, as well as transcription factors FruM and DsxM. Our findings suggest that social experience impacts multiple genes in the central brain. Disrupting Or47b, Or67d, FruM, and DsxM function normalized the transcriptional responses through antagonistic interactions. Specifically, Or47b circuits predominantly mediated transcriptional responses to social isolation through DsxM function, while Or67d and FruM regulated responses to group housing. Notably, mutants of fruM and dsxM exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes in the brain than Or mutants, especially for FruM/DsxM target genes. While social experience did not lead to detectable alterations in the overall chromatin profile in the whole brain, mutants of the four genes resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) compared to wild type. Furthermore, mutants in fruM and dsxM generally eliminated social experience-dependent changes in sleep and locomotion behaviors, whereas Or mutants exhibited more modest disruptions. Overall, our results uncover the pheromone circuits and transcriptional cascades in regulating molecular and behavioral responses to social experience.",

      "title": "Extreme Value Theory for Modeling Category Decision Boundaries in Visual Recognition",
      "content": "Several possibilities exist for modeling decision boundaries in category learning, with varying degrees of human fidelity. This paper finds evidence for preferentially focusing representational resources on the extremes of the distribution of visual inputs in a generative model as an alternative to the central tendency models that are commonly used for prototypes and exemplars. The notion of treating extrema near a decision boundary as features in visual recognition is not new, but a comprehensive statistical framework of recognition based on extrema has yet to emerge for category learning. Here we suggest that the statistical Extreme Value Theory provides such a framework. In Experiment 1, line segment stimuli that vary in a single dimension of length are used to assess how human subjects and statistical models assign category membership to a gap region between two categories shown as reference stimuli. A Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when moving from uniform to enriched or long tails as reference stimuli. In Experiment 2, more complex 2D rendered face sequences drawn from morphspaces are used as stimuli. Again, the Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when reference stimuli are sampled differently. An extrema-based model lends new insight into how discriminative information may be encoded in the brain with implications for the understanding of how decision making works in category learning.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations.

Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
