      "title": "Acute electrical neuromodulation paradigms restore firing behavior and inhibition in secondary brain injury: A computational study.",
      "content": "Secondary Brain Injury (SBI) occurs after the initial physical insult caused due to traumatic brain injuries and strokes. SBI leads to a massive loss of brain functionalities if timely intervention is not administered. This work analyses the delineated effects of three acute SBI processes in two-neuron motifs and shows that the right stimulation paradigm during specific key SBI events help restore firing rate trends in neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is extended to theoretically model two categories of two-neuron motifs: a feedforward excitatory motif (Motif 1: Two pyramidal neurons with glutamatergic synapses) and a feedforward inhibitory motif (Motif 2: One pyramidal neuron and one interneuron with GABAergic synapses). Three important SBI processes in the motifs were modeled: glutamate excitotoxicity, increased extracellular potassium ion concentration, and cellular energy deficit. Firing rate trend analysis is performed for increasing severity of SBI processes, and interesting points (key events) are identified. A wide range of ACS and DBS stimulation parameters are applied to the motifs during these key events to assess the firing rate response during stimulation. Increasing SBI severity caused an overall increase in excitation, synchronizing neuronal activities in Motif 1 and reducing inhibition in Motif 2. Alternate current stimulation paradigms were found to desynchronize and regulate neuronal firing in Motif 1. Deep brain stimulation parameters were found to increase inhibition in Motif 2, thereby helping to maintain the excitation-inhibition balance. The right stimulation paradigm administered at appropriate key events helps regulate neuronal firing, thereby reducing the metabolic burden on the neurons during acute SBI.",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "Neuromodulatory systems regulate neural circuits across broad regions of the brain, and disruption of the dopaminergic system contributes to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Engineered viral vectors have been used to target the neuromodulatory systems of the nonhuman primate brain (Y. Chen et al., 2023; El-Shamayleh et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2010; Lerchner et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2022). However, a conspicuous obstacle to the isolation and modulation of specific pathways is the inability of many retrogradely infecting viruses to transduce dopaminergic (DA) cells efficiently (Tervo et al., 2016; Cushnie et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020). We compare the DA neuron retrograde transduction efficacy of four viral vectors after injection into the striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP). Selectivity was assessed by comparing the neuronal co-expression of fluorescent reporter protein and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) antibody in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The rabies pseudotyped lentiviral vector, FuG-B2, produced superior retrograde transduction of DA cells to FuG-C or FuG-E. AAV2.retro was the least effective.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Despite over a century of research, AD remains untreatable due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. While amyloid beta has dominated therapeutic efforts, tau pathology and neuroinflammation represent critical disease drivers and intriguing therapeutic targets. We developed an extended computational model building upon the open-source Aggregation Network Diffusion (AND) framework by coupling spatial tau propagation and aggregation with ordinary differential equations representing key inflammatory cascades. The model incorporates M1/M2 microglia and astrocytic activation, cytokine-mediated feedback loops, and neuronal loss, all modulated via region-specific genetic expression matrices of ApoE and TREM2 with variant-specific weighting. The model maintains biologically plausible tau dynamics while generating robust inflammatory marker trends, serving as a computational testbed for hypothesis generation and mechanistic exploration. The inflammatory components independently capture experimental observations and display a marked M1/M2 microglia divergence. The model demonstrates enhanced similarity to regional tau propagation patterns due to inflammatory and genetic components, reinforcing neuroinflammation's role in tau spread and highlighting the need to incorporate these processes in modeling efforts. Finally, through parsimony analysis, we identify microglia and pro-inflammatory rates (including microglia-facilitated tau spread) as key contributors to improved model accuracy, informing future modeling approaches.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.
