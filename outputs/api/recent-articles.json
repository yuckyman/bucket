      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Kai Wang, one of the creators of Yuanzai World.<p>We built a simulation engine (currently on iOS & Android) that allows the community to create and share text adventures populated by multiple LLM-based agents. Unlike standard chatbots, our focus is on community co-creation\u2014users define the worldviews, and our agents (with persistent memory and social relationships) bring them to life.<p>The cool part:<p>We implemented a system we call \"World-Line Divergence\" (inspired by visual novels like Steins;Gate). Usually, AI RPGs feel random or infinite loop. We built a state machine that tracks \"World Deviation.\" If players interact with NPCs in specific ways (e.g., convincing an artist to change their style), it triggers a graph switch, leading to a completely different generated ending, effectively breaking the original script.<p>Tech Stack:<p>- Backend: Python / Java with a custom AI orchestration framework (to handle agent concurrency).<p>- Models: Hybrid routing between Gemini, GPT, and DeepSeek (optimizing for cost/performance based on task).<p>- Vector DB: Milvus (for handling long-term agent memory).<p>We are currently live on App Store and Google Play. Since it's a mobile-first experience, the link leads to our landing page where you can see the demo flow.<p>Would love to hear your feedback on the \"World-Line\" concept: Does this state-machine approach solve the aimlessness of AI RPGs?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.
