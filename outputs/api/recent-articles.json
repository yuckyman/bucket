      "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
      "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

      "title": "Representing Visual Objects, Attention, and Load in Human Occipito-temporal and Posterior Parietal Cortices",
      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "content": "Sex hormone fluctuations modulate structural and functional brain dynamics, yet little is known how sex steroid levels map onto the expression of sex differences in the brain. Here, we trained machine learning models for brain sex classification based on anatomical structures in cross-sectional data of N = 1090 individuals (50% females, age matched). Applied to dense sampled data of one male and two females in different hormonal states (naturally cycling, oral contraceptive user, pregnancy), we linked inter- and intra-individual fluctuations in brain sex to neuroendocrine modulation. We found lower variation in brain sex across time in the male compared to the female subjects. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a more female-like brain, while (inverted) U-shaped brain sex trajectories emerged across menstrual cycle phases and pregnancy trimesters. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in brain sex capture hormone-related plasticity over time in dense sampled individuals.",

      "content": "Microglia are highly plastic cells that are capable of integrating subsequent insults. As the majority of Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients also show cerebrovascular pathology, we here aimed to dissect the interactions between AD and ischemic brain injury on the microglial response to amyloid beta pathology. Surprisingly, we find that ischemic stroke in the presence of cerebral amyloid beta-amyloidosis results in the generation of a novel neuroprotective microglial phenotype. These microglia drive a rapid accumulation of highly dense amyloid beta plaques that exhibit a relatively benign nature and are strikingly similar to Amyloid beta plaques observed in patients that are resilient to AD pathology. Thus, our data do not only highlight the impact of a co-morbid state of brain ischemia and amyloid beta pathology on the microglial phenotype but also identify novel molecular pathways that may serve to promote beneficial microglial functions in AD.",

      "title": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase upregulation in Alzheimer's disease promotes blood-brain barrier dysfunction",
      "content": "Recent advances in anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease have been promising, but they have also highlighted critical challenges, including increased vascular complications, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Emerging evidence suggests that the soluble epoxide hydrolase may be a promising therapeutic target due to the involvement of sEH-derived diols in inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular destabilization. APPPS1 mice were crossed with an inducible soluble epoxide hydrolase knock-out mouse line. The knock-out was induced before onset of amyloid deposition, and then the mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and RNA sequencing techniques. Here, we identify astrocytic soluble epoxide hydrolase as a key mediator of vascular instability in Alzheimer's disease. Targeted astrocyte-specific deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase in APPPS1 mice dramatically mitigated vascular changes, reducing the vascular amyloid burden by 67.95% and preserving VE-cadherin architecture. Importantly, vasomotion was markedly impaired in the Alzheimer's disease model and was preserved in soluble epoxide hydrolase-deficient animals. Transcriptomic profiling of vasculature in APPPS1xsEH{Delta}AC mice revealed upregulated expression of genes critical for neurovascular protection. These findings identify soluble epoxide hydrolase as a central regulator of neurovascular dysfunction and underscore its therapeutic potential in increasing vascular stability in Alzheimer's disease.",

      "title": "Artificial hibernation uncovers distinct synaptic engram architecture for memory retention",
      "content": "The memory trace at the neuronal and synaptic levels remains controversial. Stable, larger spines are thought to support memory, but the high turnover of dendritic spines and the drifting of neuronal representations following memory formation suggest alternative possibilities. To elucidate a structural trace underlying memory retention, we utilize a mouse model of artificial hibernation. During hibernation, hippocampal neurons exhibited a substantial reduction in their activity and an extensive elimination of dendritic spines and synapses. Despite these changes, their memory and associated hippocampal neuronal representations are intact after arousal. We find that a subset of spines is maintained during hibernation. These spatially clustered engram-engram synapses are exclusively protected from elimination and characterized by synaptic contacts with multi-synaptic boutons. These findings suggest that synaptic engram architecture, rather than larger spines per se, is resilient to network remodeling and underlies long-term memory retention.",

      "content": "Learning a motor skill requires exploring multiple possible solutions to find and retain an optimal strategy. The exploration and consolidation of the motor strategy are usually considered to be segregated respectively between task practice and rest periods. Here we show that two types of offline reactivations of neuronal representations of locomotor strategies in a brain-wide motor circuit are associated with exploration and retention. During short rests between trials, replays of these brainwide representations predict subsequent shifts in strategies indicating that distributed offline processes participate in strategy exploration. Shifts in strategy are consolidated, and their retention follows population reactivation in cerebellar sleep spindles and stabilization of cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity patterns, consistent with the role of spindles in brain plasticity. Overall, motor strategy optimization and consolidation are supported by two intertwined but distinct types of offline distributed reactivation events involving interregional interactions.",

      "title": "PKC-dependent MYRF dysregulation links A\u03b2 pathology to oligodendrocyte, myelin and cognitive alterations in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized not only by neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction but also by emerging evidence of oligodendrocyte and myelin pathology. Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, disrupts oligodendrocyte homeostasis through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a transcription factor essential for oligodendrocyte maturation, in AD-related glial dysfunction. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we observed aberrantly induced maturation dynamics and reduced oligodendrocyte lineage cell density at 12 months in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by increased MYRF expression. Interestingly, sustained MYRF overexpression was found to be toxic for oligodendrocytes in vitro. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that A{beta} exposure elevates MYRF protein levels and enhances its transcriptional activity, pointing to post-translational regulation. Mechanistically, A{beta} impaired GSK3-dependent phosphorylation and Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination of MYRF, prolonging N-MYRF stability, an effect prevented by PKC inhibition in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of PKC inhibitor Go6983 normalized MYRF levels, restored oligodendrocyte populations and myelin integrity, and improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice, with locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior remaining unaffected. Together, these findings identify MYRF dysregulation as a mechanistic link between A{beta}/PKC signaling and oligodendrocyte pathology, and highlight PKC inhibition as a potential strategy to restore oligodendroglial function and cognition in AD.",

      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.
