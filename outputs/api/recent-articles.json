      "title": "A specialized cold sensing system in the naked mole-rat",
      "content": "Avoiding cold or seeking warmth are universal animal needs. Homeothermic mammals maintain a constant body temperature despite fluctuating ambient temperatures. One exception is the naked mole-rat which lacks effective thermogenesis. We show that the naked mole-rat has evolved a greatly expanded cold sensing system. Compared to mice, this species has many more cold-sensitive sensory neurons and most express the cold-activated TRPM8 channel. The naked mole-rat TrpM8 gene harbors a unique upstream exon that when translated produces a TRPM8 protein with a 71 amino acid N-terminal extension. When expressed, the N-terminal extension prevents membrane targeting and abolishes TRPM8 function. Splice forms lacking the extension formed functional cold and menthol activated channels in vivo. Additionally, many naked mole-rat sensory neurons use a TRPM8-independent mechanism to detect cold. Thus, we identified molecular changes that confer both sensitivity and flexibility to cold sensing in a species that is critically dependent on following thermal cues.",

      "title": "Proteolytic cleavage of G3BP1 by calpain 1 couples NMDAR activation to mTOR-dependent local translation",
      "content": "Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are dynamic, membraneless organelles that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of localized protein synthesis. While disassembly of RNP granules is essential for reactivating translation, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) triggers calcium influx, leading to activation of calpain 1 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a core component of stress granules. This cleavage results in the disassembly of G3BP1 granules in the neurites and promotes mTOR-dependent local translation, thereby linking synaptic activity to spatially restricted protein synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that the NMDAR-calpain 1-G3BP1-mTOR signaling axis contributes to axonal regeneration, establishing proteolytic remodeling of RNP granules as a key mechanism of activity-dependent neural repair, with potential implications for therapeutic intervention in brain injury.",

      "title": "Brain-wide representational drift: memory consolidation and entropic force",
      "content": "Memory engrams change on the microscopic level with time and experience as the neurons that compose them switch in a process termed representational drift. On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.",

      "title": "CS - plasticity and behavioral-state integration in the posterior insula during auditory fear learning",
      "content": "During fear learning, animals learn to associate sensory cues (conditioned stimulus, CS) with aversive outcomes, and neurons in several brain areas become entrained to the CS. The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning (\"CS learners\"). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.",

      "content": "Hyperscanning approaches mark a shift from single- to two-person neuroscience, enabling a more profound understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying interpersonal synchronization. In this context, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for measuring brain activity in a natural, unconstrained environment. While interpersonal synchrony using fNIRS hyperscanning has been well-studied using statistical association analysis, establishing causal relationships...",

Neuroimaging results showed that on average infants displayed greater functional connectivity in the right than in the left hemisphere of the DMN, adding to prior work indicating faster...",

When do each of these regions, and their distinctive functions, develop? We review recent studies of awake human infants' cortical responses to faces using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results converge, and argue...",
