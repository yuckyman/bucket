      "title": "N-Linked Glycosylation as a Driver of Tau Pathology and Neuronal Transmission",
      "content": "N-Linked glycosylation of tau is implicated in Alzheimers disease, yet how it influences tau propagation and neuronal uptake remains unclear. Here, we use chemically defined N-glycoforms of 2N4R tau and the K18 repeat domain to map how glycan site and structure reprogram tau-polyanion binding, seeding, and entry into human neurons. Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications. Cross-seeding experiments show that N-glycosylation selectively tunes nucleation compatibility between tau proteoforms; GlcNAc at Asn410 in full-length tau and small glycans at Asn359 in K18 most strongly accelerate aggregation. In HEK293T FRET biosensor cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons, N-glycans enhance or suppress seeding and pHrodo-reported uptake in a site- and glycan-dependent manner, with Asn410 glycosylation markedly potentiating cellular seeding. Pharmacological inhibition with atropine, dynasore, and cytochalasin D further indicates that N-glycans rebalance muscarinic, dynamin-dependent, and actin-dependent uptake routes. Together, these data establish N-linked glycosylation as a tunable regulator of tau trafficking and prion-like spread, coupling extracellular receptor usage to intracellular cofactor engagement, and reveals druggable nodes in uptake.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",
