      "title": "OfUSA: OpenfUS Analyzer, a versatile open-source framework for the analysis and visualization of functional ultrasound imaging data across animal models",
      "content": "Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging is rapidly gaining interest for its unprecedented ability to study large-scale brain dynamics, yet its adoption and broader dissemination have been hindered by the lack of standardized tools and methodologies to analyze and interpret its rich datasets. We present OpenfUS Analyzer (OfUSA), a companion software suite designed to help researchers quickly engage with fUS data and perform the full range of analyses needed to generate publication-ready results and figures without relying on additional software. OfUSA offers a versatile and modular architecture including preprocessing, recording quality assessment, signal dynamics exploration, statistical analysis and visualization. These functions are separated yet easily combined into analytic pipelines through a programming-free graphical interface. The framework can be applied across species and experimental contexts, either by registering data to anatomical atlases, as shown here for the mouse brain, or by analyzing data without atlas constraints, as illustrated in a primate dataset. This flexibility, together with its comprehensive functionality, makes OfUSA a practical solution for standardized and reproducible analysis of fUS data in both preclinical and translational research. Using OfUSA, we demonstrate the capacity to detect stimulus-evoked responses with high sensitivity, identify their spatial localization within brain networks, and quantify both their extent and temporal dynamics. These results highlight the software's ability to capture robust activation patterns and provide detailed insights into brain function, thereby accelerating the use of fUS as a powerful tool for systems neuroscience.",

      "title": "Trait-Relevant Tasks Improve Personality Prediction from Structural-Functional Brain Network Coupling",
      "content": "Personality traits capture stable patterns of behavior and thought, and neurobiological correlates were identified in structural and functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether the coupling between structural and functional brain networks (SC-FC coupling), during resting state and seven tasks of varying trait-relevance, is associated with individual differences in the Big Five personality traits. We used diffusion-weighted and functional magnetic resonance imaging from 764 participants of the Human Connectome Project and modelled individual differences in SC-FC coupling with similarity and communication measures. These measures approximate functional interactions unfolding on top of the structural connectome and were set in relation to individual variations in personality traits. Significant associations were only observed during trait-relevant tasks: for agreeableness during social cognition, and conscientiousness could be predicted from task-general coupling patterns. We conclude that optimizing trait-relevance of tasks during neuroscientific measurements presents a promising means to increase effect sizes in studies on brain-behavior associations.",

      "title": "PEDOT:PSS conducting eutectogel for enhanced electrical recording and stimulation in implantable neural interfaces",
      "content": "Conductive polymers such as PEDOT:PSS are widely used in bioelectronic interfaces due to their mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and biocompatibility. However, their mechanical fragility and limited processability constrain their performance in implantable devices. Deep eutectic solvents (DES), when combined with PEDOT:PSS, form eutectogels that enable thick, soft coatings. Here, we present a PEDOT:PSS-based eutectogel incorporating choline chloride: lactic acid and GOPS, integrated into flexible thin-film electrode arrays for sciatic nerve interfacing. These implants feature an array of electrodes and a pre-formed spiral geometry to conformally wrap small-diameter nerves. Devices were fabricated using standard photolithography and reactive ion etching techniques, allowing side-by-side comparison of PEDOT:PSS/DES with conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. PEDOT:PSS/DES enabled single-layer films up to 800 nm thick, significantly greater than PEDOT:PSS, and yielding over two-fold improvements in impedance and charge injection capacity in vitro. Acute in vivo electrophysiology in rats confirmed enhanced neural recording and stimulation capabilities, with lower impedance, higher capacitance, and reduced motor activation thresholds. While PEDOT:PSS/DES more reliably elicited motor responses at lower stimulation currents, electromyogram signal amplitudes from the tibialis anterioris at matched stimulation levels were comparable between materials. These results suggest that while superior electrochemical properties improve neural interface performance, local electrode-tissue interactions remain critical. Overall, this work establishes DES-modified PEDOT:PSS as a promising electrode material for soft neural interfaces and highlights its potential for advancing implantable bioelectronics.",

      "title": "Early micro and nanoscopic responses of microglia to blood-brain barrier modulation by transcranial-focused ultrasound",
      "content": "Modulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using transcranial-focused ultrasound (FUS) has rapidly progressed to clinical trials. In combination with phospholipid microspheres, also known as microbubbles, administered in the bloodstream, ultrasound energy is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target specific brain regions with millimetric precision. At the targeted area, the interaction between FUS and microbubbles increases local BBB permeability for 4 to 6 hours, with an ensuing inflammation that resolves within days to weeks. Microglia, as the resident immune cells of the brain, are triggered by FUS-BBB modulation, although the time course of this response is unclear. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize the early cellular (i.e., density, distribution, and morphology) and subcellular (i.e., ultrastructure) changes in microglial activities following FUS-BBB modulation. Methods: We targeted the hippocampi of adult mice with FUS, in the presence of intravenous microbubbles and guided by MRI, and performed analyses 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. Microglia were investigated at the population, cellular and subcellular levels, where hippocampal BBB permeability was identified by the entry of endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig)G in the parenchyma. Respective outcome measures included i) the density and distribution of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-positive (Iba)1-positive (+) cells; ii) the morphology of the soma and processes of Iba1+ cells; and iii) the quantification of microglial organelles (e.g., phagosomes) and contacts with blood vessels and synapses using chip mapping scanning electron microscopy. Results: No significant changes in baseline density and distribution of microglia were found in IgG-positive hippocampal areas at 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation. By contrast, FUS-BBB modulation was associated with more elongated microglial cell bodies at both time points. The relative distribution of morphologies at 1 hour shifted toward compact shapes with stubby processes, whereas at 24 hours, shapes were bigger, with fewer processes. At the nanoscale, microglia maintained their interactions with blood vessel elements, except vessels most affected by swollen endfeet, which occurred regardless of treatment. In the parenchyma, 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, microglia reduced the frequency of contacts with pre-synaptic elements and extracellular space pockets, while showing features of increased metabolic demand and reduced lysosomal activity. Conclusion: At 1 hour and 24 hours after FUS-BBB modulation, traits of microglial surveillance activity were largely maintained, with shifts in the shape of a subset of cells, which adopted a morphology associated with injury shielding. FUS-BBB modulation also appears to temporarily modify the digestive, but not the phagocytic activity, of microglia and to reduce pre-synaptic remodeling early after treatment.",

      "content": "Chronic pain states are challenging to control with current drug therapies. Here, we demonstrate that a single dose of psilocybin can produce a sustained anti-nociceptive effect in a model of chronic neuropathic pain in male and female mice. Psilocybin anti-nociceptive effects were mediated by 5-HT2A receptors, although additional mechanisms might also be involved. Furthermore, a single dose of psilocybin caused a significant increase in the anti-nociceptive potential of gabapentin, a widely used treatment for neuropathic pain consistent with the establishment of longer lasting changes in network processing. Overall, these findings present the first preclinical evidence that psilocybin could be a valuable approach for treating chronic pain from nerve injury and serve as a new therapeutic addition for pain management.",

      "title": "Task-Parametrized Dynamics: Representation of Time and Decisions in Recurrent Neural Networks",
      "content": "How do recurrent neural networks (RNNs) internally represent elapsed time to initiate responses after learned delays? To address this question, we trained RNNs on delayed decision-making tasks of increasing complexity: binary decisions, context-dependent decisions, and perceptual integration. We analyzed RNN dynamics after training using eigenvalue spectra, connectivity structure, and population trajectories, and found that 1) distinct dynamical regimes emerge across networks trained on the same task whereby oscillatory dynamics support precise timing, and integration supports evidence accumulation, 2) a population-wide representation of time and decision variables emerges rather than dedicated sub-populations to tracking time and other task-specific variables; and 3) the neural trajectories align only with the output weights near decision points, as shown by trajectory readout correlations, revealing task-driven coordination of precisely timed task representation and readout. These results show that RNNs can use either integration or oscillations to represent time, and highlight how structured connectivity enables diverse solutions to temporal computation problems, consistent with biological principles of degeneracy and functional redundancy.",

      "title": "Distribution of big tau isoforms in the human central and peripheral nervous system",
      "content": "Objective: To characterize the distribution of big tau, a longer tau isoform expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and select central nervous system (CNS) regions, and to examine its relationship with aging and neurodegeneration. Methods: We performed mass spectrometric sequencing of big tau sequence and mapped its distribution across the human nervous system. Postmortem samples included brains from Alzheimer disease (AD), disease controls, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord from young controls, disease controls and ALS; and peripheral nerves. Big and small tau levels were also quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from young normal controls, amyloid positive and amyloid negative participants. Results: Human big tau results from the insertion of 355 amino acids in the tau protein, encoded by the exon 4a-long and not exon 4a-short. Alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 generates multiple big tau isoforms, expanding the known human tau repertoire. Total tau concentration is ~ 1000-fold higher in the brain than in PNS, where big tau rises sharply along a central-to-peripheral gradient, comprising ~ 50 % of total tau in peripheral nerves compared to only ~ 1 % in brain. CSF big tau levels remain unaltered with CSF A{beta} abnormalities in AD, unlike the small tau isoform, which increases significantly with concomitant A{beta} and cognitive abnormalities. Interpretation: Big tau exhibits a distinct distribution in the human nervous system, decoupled from the changes associated with brain-derived small tau in AD. These findings open opportunities for developing specific blood-based biomarkers to differentiate CNS versus PNS disorders.",

      "title": "Cortical Origins of the Flash-Lag Effect distortions: The Influence of Retinotopic Map Architecture",
      "content": "The flash-lag effect (FLE) is an illusion whereby the position of a moving object is perceived as being offset in the direction of movement when compared to a flashed static stimulus. This perceptual misalignment has been posited as a key phenomenon in explaining our ability to accurately predict the future position of moving objects, despite the delays in neuronal processing. Our working hypothesis is that the FLE is resulting from the anticipation generated by propagation of neural activity within visual cortical retinotopical maps. According to this hypothesis, the FLE should be affected by discontinuities and anisotropies of the retinotopic map architecture. Using psychophysics we show that the FLE is strongly affected by crossing and the direction of motion in respect to retinotopic features, such as vertical and horizontal meridians and the fovea. The specificity of how early visual cortical retinotopic maps are splitted and magnified around these features led us to suggest that the FLE distortions emerge from propagation in retinotopically organized networks, particularly V1. This work bridges the gap between human psychophysics and the known constraints of retinotopic maps layout, offering a testable framework for future studies of motion position encoding in the visual hierarchy.",

      "title": "Decoding human lifespan from neural noise and explaining age-related changes in fractal dimension and gamma oscillations using fractional harmonic oscillator",
      "content": "Predicting human lifespan is a longstanding objective of biomedical research. Traditional statistical models estimate mortality risk or biological age but not lifespan. We propose a two-parameter model based on stochastic fractional harmonic oscillator for neural signals. The model computes maximum human lifespan using 1/f slope, the measure of neural power decay with frequency, which is indicative of neural noise. Using slope rate from electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic datasets, we estimate the mean lifetimes of healthy adults and epileptic patients as 76.9 and 69.7 years, resulting in 89.4% and 96.9% accuracy respectively. Additionally, the present model resolves the inconsistency in age-related changes of fractal dimension (FD) and captures naturally the non-monotonic variation of stimulus-induced gamma power. Thus, the present model provides a simple way to estimate lifespan while explaining age-related changes in slope, FD and power simultaneously, thereby, paving the way for individualized lifetime measurements and unveiling fundamental principles governing life.",
