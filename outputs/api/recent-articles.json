      "content": "Sleep is essential for health and light is an important environmental signal influencing its timing, quality, and regulation. Retinal light exposure reflects the interplay between environmental illumination and behavioral choices, yet it remains unclear which habitual light exposure-related behaviors meaningfully impact sleep outcomes. In this preregistered analysis, we examined associations between these behaviors, sleep timing, and sleep complaints in a large, international community sample (N = 774, mean age = 32.6 {+/-} 14.6 years). Participants completed the Light Exposure Behavior Assessment (LEBA), with four behavioral domains included in the analyses. Sleep timing, sleep disturbances and sleep-related daytime impairment were measured using established questionnaires. Bayesian analyses indicated that time spent outdoors and device use in bed were most strongly associated with sleep outcomes. Greater time outdoors was linked to earlier sleep timing and fewer sleep complaints, whereas more frequent device use in bed was associated with greater sleep disturbance and daytime impairment. Morning and daytime lighting practices and evening light control showed no conclusive evidence. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of everyday light exposure-related behaviors for sleep and support behavioral approaches to promoting healthy sleep in real-world contexts.",

      "title": "A prelimbic molecular clock of protein synthesis for memory persistence",
      "content": "Emotionally salient associative memories can endure for long periods, yet the mechanisms that determine their long-term stability remain unclear. Here we show that the prelimbic (PL) cortex integrates temporally structured translational programs to control both the consolidation and reconsolidation of cued threat memories. Using Pavlovian threat conditioning with in vivo fiber photometry, we found that PL calcium dynamics tightly track memory strength: discrete threat-predictive cues evoked robust activity during recent and single-timepoint remote retrieval, whereas prior retrieval selectively weakened remote expression, independent of contextual influences. Translational profiling of PL Camk2a cells uncovered a biphasic consolidation program, with an early phase characterized by ER stress-linked translational repression and robust oligodendrocyte plasticity, followed by a delayed phase engaging synaptic growth pathways. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that eIF2-regulated, cap-independent translation is essential for recent consolidation and for the enduring stabilization of remote memory, whereas retrieval-induced destabilization engages a mechanistically distinct, eIF4E-dependent translational pathway required for reconsolidation. These findings identify the PL cortex as a dynamic node in which discrete modes of translational control govern the long-term persistence of emotional memories.",

      "content": "Direct lineage reprogramming of glial cells into neurons offers a promising strategy to repair diseased brain circuits, but engineering defined neuronal subtypes remains challenging. We found that a phospho-site-deficient Ascl1 variant, Ascl1SA6, but not wildtype Ascl1, induces hallmarks of parvalbumin fast-spiking interneurons, raising the question of how closely these induced neurons resemble canonical cortical interneurons and what transcriptional events underlie this process. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ascl1SA6-induced neurons only partially recapitulated canonical interneuron programs and failed to induce the transcription factor Dlx2 and its downstream targets. Co-expression of Dlx2 with Ascl1SA6 restored a more canonical interneuron-like transcriptome, including genes involved in migration, and resulted in neurons occupying laminar positions more typical of endogenous interneurons. These findings provide molecular insights into how Ascl1 posttranslational modifications regulate its transcriptional activity and demonstrate a strategy to engineer induced cortical interneurons that more closely resemble their native counterparts, offering a framework for layer-specific restoration of inhibitory circuits in neurological diseases.",

      "content": "Enhancement of neuronal plasticity is a key determinant of the onset of antidepressant responses. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent synaptic plasticity is essential for antidepressant efficacy, we examined whether fast-acting antidepressants directly trigger BDNF release. At antidepressant-relevant concentrations, ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) induced BDNF secretion from mossy fiber terminals of granule neurons within minutes of application in rat hippocampal cultures. BDNF release required selective NMDAR signaling, as conditional genetic deletion of presynaptic NMDARs from granule neurons or from postsynaptic NMDARs from CA3 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, abolished BDNF exocytosis in response to both ketamine and HNK or selectively to HNK, respectively. Both compounds produced acute synaptic plasticity, reflected by gains and losses of CA3 dendritic spines without a net change in overall spine density. These findings reveal distinct, drug-specific NMDAR mechanisms at mossy fiber terminal-CA3 synapses that drive rapid BDNF release by fast-acting antidepressants.",

      "title": "Fidelity of Spatiotemporal Patterns of Brain Activity Across Sampling Rate, Scan Duration, and Frequency Content",
      "content": "Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by large-scale spatiotemporal patterns that underpin functional connectivity and cognition. Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) have emerged as reproducible methods for capturing spatiotemporal network interactions in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). However, these methods remain sensitive to methodological factors such as scan duration, repetition time (TR), and frequency band selection. This study systematically evaluates how these parameters influence the stability and reliability of QPP- and cPCA-derived functional connectivity patterns across multiple datasets. Using five independent rs-fMRI datasets, we evaluate the impact of scan length on pattern reliability, explore the effects of TR on spatiotemporal patterns, and compare the sensitivity of different frequency bands (Slow-5, Slow-4, infraslow) in capturing network dynamics. Our findings reveal that while both QPPs and cPCA detect intrinsic network activity, their reliability varies with acquisition parameters. QPPs exhibit greater stability in shorter scans, making them suitable for individual-level analyses, whereas cPCA provides a broader representation of phase-coherent fluctuations but shows greater between-subject variability and benefits more from longer, group-level acquisitions. Additionally, frequency band selection significantly influences the temporal structure of extracted patterns: in our analyses, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) tended to emphasize more recurrent, synchronized network configurations, whereas Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) more often revealed transitions between connectivity states. These results provide critical insights into optimizing methodological choices for dynamic functional connectivity analysis, enhancing the interpretability of spatiotemporal patterns in both basic and clinical neuroimaging research.",
