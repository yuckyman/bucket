      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
      "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
      "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Long non-coding RNA Cerox1 targets components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to regulate the memory impairment caused by sleep deprivation",
      "content": "Sleep deprivation (SD) impairs long-term memory, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of sleep loss on memory are poorly understood. Molecular changes driven by SD have thus far focused on transcription and translation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of regulatory RNAs, have recently been recognized as an important player in memory research. However, it remains unclear how sleep deprivation modulates the expression of lncRNAs or their targets to lead to memory impairment. In this study, we explored the role of lncRNAs in the disruption of spatial memory caused by SD. We examined a set of synapse-associated lncRNAs that were identified through a transcriptome analysis after SD. Among them, we discovered that the lncRNA Cerox1 is downregulated in dorsal hippocampus following SD, and its levels recover after 2.5 hours of rebound sleep. Sleep is critical for the regulation of metabolism and sleep loss impairs mitochondrial function. Both sleep deprivation and Cerox1 knockdown were found to reduce complex I activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This reduction of complex I activity is linked to the decrease in expression of a subset of complex I subunits including Ndufs1, Ndufs3, Ndufa3 and Ndufs6. Overexpression of Cerox1 has the opposite effect, leading to increased complex I activity. Sleep deprivation reduced ATP levels in the dorsal hippocampus, while Cerox1 overexpression restored it. SD disrupted memory consolidation, and this impairment was rescued when Cerox1 was overexpressed. Cerox1 transcript contains multiple miRNA binding sites that regulate the activity of the lncRNA. Notably, overexpression of Cerox1 transcript lacking miRNA binding sites did not rescue the memory deficit caused by SD. Our findings demonstrated that the impairment of memory consolidation after SD is linked to lncRNA-mediated control of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity essential for sustaining energy requirements.",

      "title": "Excitatory cholecystokinin neurons in CA3 area regulate the navigation learning and neuroplasticity",
      "content": "Hippocampus, a key hub of neural circuits for spatial learning and memory, has attracted tremendous studies. Neuronal information processing in the hippocampus can be regulated by many types of neuropeptides. Cholecystokinin (CCK), the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system which is involved in modulating neuronal functions, such as cognition, memory and neuroplasticity, is widely expressed in the hippocampus. However, whether local excitatory CCK neurons modulates hippocampal function is still unclear. In this study, we showed that CA1 pyramidal neurons receive projections from excitatory CCK neurons in area CA3 (CA3CCK neurons). Subsequently, activation of the CA1-projecting CA3CCK neurons triggers the release of CCK. Then, we found that activity of CA3CCK-CA1 neurons supports the hippocampal-dependent tasks. Furthermore, inhibition of CA3CCK-CA1 projections or knockdown of CA3CCK gene expression markedly impaired the behavioral tasks and neuroplasticity. Taken together, these results may add to a better understanding of how neuromodulators regulate the neural functions in central nervous system.",

      "title": "Altered network function in hippocampus after sub-chronic activation of Cannabis receptors in peri-adolescence",
      "content": "The Cannabinoid 1-receptor (CB1R) is found in particularly high levels in the hippocampus (HPC), increased CB1R density and binding observed in patients with schizophrenia, and epidemiological studies suggest that regular cannabis use during adolescence is a risk factor for the disease. Historically, concerns around adolescent marijuana use focused on the development of psychosis later in life, however recent findings indicate that cognitive domains may also be at risk. CB1R was shown to interfere with neuronal network oscillations and to impair sensory gating and memory function. Neuronal oscillations are essential in multiple cognitive functions and their impairment was documented in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how adolescent pre-treatment with the CB1R selective agonist CP-55940 may lead to abnormalities in theta synchronization in adulthood. Rats were pre-treated with CP-55940 (n=11, 6 males, 5 females) or vehicle (n=8, 4 males, 4 females) during adolescence (daily i/p injections between PND 32-36 or PND 42-46, n=10 and 9, respectively). They were then tested in adulthood (PND 70-88, n=17 or PND 111-115, n=2) under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta rhythm was elicited by brainstem stimulation at 5 intensity levels one hour before and up to 5 hours after injection. We found a lasting significant decrease in theta power after CP-55940 in adult rats which was aggravated further in rats pre-treated in adolescence with the CB1R agonist. The effect was significantly larger (p=0.0462) in rats pre-treated during early adolescence (PND 32-36) compared to the group pre-treated during late adolescence (PND 42-46). We conclude that 1. Exposure to cannabis during adolescence leads to increased sensitivity to CB1R agonist in adulthood; 2. Early adolescence, a critical period for development of HPC networks generating theta rhythm, is particularly prone to this sensitivity.",

      "title": "Kat5 cKO Biological Domain Signatures Align with Human Alzheimer Disease",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with amyloid plaques and can be caused by autosomal dominant mutations in APP or PSEN1/2, which form an enzyme substrate complex. Decreases in catalysis of AD mutant APP and PSEN1 supports the hypothesis that membrane delimitation of KAT5 could contribute to AD. METHODS: We compare the hippocampal transcriptome profiles of the Kat5 brain-specific knockout mouse to multiple AD datasets through alignment with the TREAT-AD AD biological domains. We examine KAT5 subcellular localization in human WT and AD neurons. RESULTS: The Kat5 KO mouse demonstrates downregulation of synaptic genes, metabolic pathways, and upregulation of DNA replication and repair, cell cycle and immune response genes. We see similar profiles in Kat5 and comparative AD datasets. KAT5 is restricted to the cytosol in human AD neurons. DISCUSSION: This analysis supports the hypothesis that KAT5 nuclear signaling down stream of APP cleavage plays a pivotal role in neuronal homeostasis and immune regulation.",

      "title": "Loss of PIKfyve in Rod Photoreceptors and RPE Cells Leads to Endolysosomal Dysfunction and Retinal Degeneration",
      "content": "Photoreceptor outer segment (OS) degradation is primarily mediated by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells through daily phagocytosis of shed distal OS tips. In contrast, much less is understood about the cell-autonomous mechanisms photoreceptors use to clear mislocalized molecules caused by protein misfolding or trafficking defects. Mislocalized or excess rhodopsin that fails to reach the OS is retained in the inner segment or cell body, where it is presumably degraded via the endolysosomal system. We identify PIKfyve, a phosphoinositide kinase that generates PI(3,5)P2, as a key regulator of this pathway. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), we find that PIKfyve is highly expressed in rod photoreceptors. Rod-specific PIKfyve deletion causes progressive retinal degeneration, marked by inner segment vacuolation, elevated LAMP1/2, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and eventual loss of rod and cone function. Loss of one copy of PIKfyve in rod photoreceptors accelerates degeneration in P23H rhodopsin mutant mice. In RPE cells, PIKfyve loss disrupts phagocytosis and autophagy, leading to accumulation of rhodopsin, LAMP1, LC3A/B, and lipid droplets, along with metabolic disturbances. These findings demonstrate that PIKfyve is essential for photoreceptor and RPE health by regulating lysosomal function, phagocytosis, autophagy, and metabolism, and suggest that enhancing PIKfyve activity could be a therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Modulation of MC4R in the Periaqueductal Gray Does Not Alter Social Behavior",
      "content": "Competing motivational drives are integral to survival and encompass a spectrum of internal physiological needs such as hunger to external goals like social connection. Elucidating how these motivational states interact at the neural level is critical to our understanding of adaptive behavior. Hunger-driven behaviors are primarily initiated by agouti-related peptide (AgRP), an inverse agonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which acts to promote feeding by suppressing MC4R signaling. MC4R is present in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain region involved in pain, appetite, and social behavior. A pilot study found a dense concentration of AgRP fibers in the PAG of male rats, suggesting a potential link between hunger-related signaling and social behavior in this region. To investigate the role of AgRP and MC4R in the PAG on social interaction, we conducted a within-subject dose-response experiment using male rats. Subjects received bilateral microinjections (0.5 L/side) of either vehicle, an MC4R agonist (THIQ), or an antagonist (HS014) into the PAG prior to a five-minute social exploration (SE) test with a novel juvenile conspecific. Contrary to our hypothesis, pharmacological manipulation of MC4R activity in the PAG did not produce significant changes in social interaction time, suggesting that MC4R in the PAG may not directly play a major role in modulating social behavior in rodents. These results highlight the complexity of the neural circuitry involved in social motivation, hunger, and other competing motivational states.",

      "title": "Lateral septal inhibition of nucleus basalis through direct and indirect pathways in focal limbic seizures",
      "content": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy and is characterized by focal seizures originating from limbic structures, including the hippocampus. Patients with TLE often experience impaired consciousness. A recent awake mouse model study demonstrated decreased cortical cholinergic innervation during focal seizures with impaired consciousness, based on cortical slow wave activity and decreased behavioral responsiveness. But the underlying mechanisms for reduced cortical cholinergic activity are not fully understood. This study employs the same awake mouse model combined with electrophysiology recordings in key network nodes, cell-specific calcium imaging in the lateral septum, and neurotransmitter sensing in one of the major subcortical cholinergic systems, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). We demonstrate that decreased cortical cholinergic innervation during focal seizures comes from both direct inhibition and indirect de-excitation of the NBM, showing a parallel pathway NBM suppression mechanism from the LS directly and through the paratenial thalamic nucleus indirectly. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the neural processes involved in impaired consciousness during focal seizures and may open the way to new treatments for this disorder.",
