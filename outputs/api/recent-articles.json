      "title": "Neurodegeneration emerges at a cellular tipping point between protein accumulation and removal.",
      "content": "Protein aggregates are a hallmark of pathology across neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the disconnect between molecular- level aggregation and the emergence of disease severely limits mechanistic understanding of neurodegeneration. Here, we bridge this disconnect by showing that a cellular tipping point emerges as a universal feature across diseases from the competition between aggregate accumulation and removal. We map the resulting cellular phase transition with our high-throughput live-cell assay, measuring the tipping point that separates healthy cells from those burdened with large aggregate loads. Using super-resolution imaging of brain tissue from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, we quantify how the crucial balance of accumulation and removal is shifted in disease. Combined with in vitro aggregation kinetics, we then validate our framework by predicting how designed aggregation inhibitors shift the tipping point to restore cellular homeostasis. Our results provide a mechanistic framework to connect molecular-level aggregation to disease states, paving the way for a quantitative, unified understanding of neurodegeneration and enabling predictions of the complex, non-linear dynamics that govern therapeutic efficacy.",

      "title": "Capturing instantaneous neural signal-behavior relationships with concurrent functional mixed models",
      "content": "We previously proposed an analysis framework for fiber photometry data based on functional linear mixed models (FLMMs). Functional LMMs allow modeling associations between photometry traces and trial-specific scalar values like behavioral summaries and session number, while also accounting for between-animal heterogeneity. Here, we extend the method to concurrent FLMMs (cFLMMs), a method that can fit the instantaneous relationship between functional outcomes and functional covariates. Concurrent FLMMs enable testing of how the photometry signal is associated with, for example, a behavioral variable that evolves across within-trial timepoints (e.g. animal speed). cFLMMs can also model the relationship between the photometry signal and covariates in experiments with variable trial lengths (e.g., in studies where trials end when an animal responds). We illustrate the application of cFLMMs on two published studies and show the method can identify signal-behavior associations in analyses not possible with FLMMs. We find that analyzing photometry-behavior associations based on behavioral summaries (e.g., latency-to-response, average lick rate) can lead to misleading conclusions. We published our method in the fastFMM package, available as an R package through GitHub (https://github.com/awqx/fastFMM).",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",
