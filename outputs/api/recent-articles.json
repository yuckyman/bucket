      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis.

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
      "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe Model Human Processor (MHP), while useful, lacks direct neurophysiological validation. This study aimed to validate and extend the MHP by analyzing P300 and Bereitschaftspotential (BP) brainwave components.MethodsOur initial finding of qualitatively different neural signatures between correct and incorrect trials led to the hypothesis that the \u201ccorrect\u201d trial group is a mixture of different processing types. We tested this by segregating correct trials based on the presence or absence of the P300 component, which we reasoned is a key marker of the MHP\u2019s conscious \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.ResultsWe identified a P300-absent subgroup even among correct responses. This subgroup exhibited significantly shorter reaction times than its P300-present counterpart and showed a neural signature strikingly similar to that of incorrect trials, including a delayed negative peak in the BP.DiscussionThese results suggest the human information processing pathway is not monolithic. We propose a new model that bifurcates after perception into either a \u201cDeliberate Process\u201d (P300-present), which aligns with the MHP, or a high-speed \u201cAutomatic Process\u201d (P300-absent) that bypasses the MHP\u2019s \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process. This work provides neurophysiological validation for the MHP and lends new neural support for dual-process theory.",

      "title": "Hypertrophic olivary degeneration secondary to brain abscess: a case report and literature review",
      "content": "IntroductionHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare transsynaptic neurodegenerative disorder arising from disruption of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), a neural circuit critical for motor coordination. Classical clinical presentation includes palatal tremor. While cerebrovascular etiology dominates reported cases, HOD secondary to intracranial infections remains poorly characterized, posing diagnostic challenges.Case presentationA 72-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with a 7-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Initial neuroimaging revealed right cerebellar hematoma with multiple brain abscesses. Antibacterial treatment achieved symptomatic improvement, but follow-up was lost. Seven months later, readmission occurred due to memory decline and personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left anterior medulla oblongata and hemosiderosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the absence of clinical manifestations of HOD, prior abscess-induced GMT involvement strongly supported the diagnosis. Symptomatic management stabilized the patient, with persistent lesions but no clinical progression at 5-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case documents a rare case of HOD following bacterial brain abscess, presenting with atypical clinical features. It expands the etiological spectrum of HOD and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in post-infectious neurological deterioration. Multimodal MRI facilitates early diagnosis and timely intervention, highlighting its critical role in managing this underrecognized entity.",

      "title": "Differences in structural brain morphometry between musicians and non-musicians",
      "content": "ObjectiveAlthough music has been shown to affect brain function, the structural characteristics of the brain in musicians compared to non-musicians are often overlooked. This limited attention restricts the practical use of music\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and motor functions. The current study aimed to investigate structural differences in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of musical training.MethodsSixteen musicians and seventeen age-matched non-musicians underwent a brain structural neuroimaging scan. Group differences in structural morphometry were assessed.ResultsSignificant differences were found in cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth measures. Compared to non-musicians, musicians showed greater cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right central parietal region, and showed structural advantages in fractal dimensionality and sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus and right central region. In contrast, non-musicians showed greater gyrification in the bilateral insula, right superior parietal lobule, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, significant interactive effects were observed between gender and cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth in regions of the limbic system, including the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus.ConclusionStructural differences in the frontal cortex, limbic system, and sensorimotor areas between musicians and non-musicians highlight the changes in brain structure associated with musical training. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of music-related brain function and may provide guidance for future applications of music to improve mental health and neuroplasticity.",

      "content": "BackgroundAcute stress may disrupt decision - making by affecting cognitive and emotional processing. The behavioral and neural mechanisms of this in athletes are unclear. This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

      "title": "Rising burden of subarachnoid hemorrhage linked to high systolic blood pressure among young and middle-aged populations: temporal trends and global implication",
      "content": "BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that leads to high mortality and long-term disability, particularly among adults aged 25\u201349 years. Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable risk factor, yet its global burden in this age group has not been systematically assessed.MethodsWe analyzed population-level epidemiological data across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 to estimate SAH mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to high SBP. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories to 2050 were projected with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsGlobally, SAH caused 24,908 deaths and 1,373,366 DALYs in 2021 due to high SBP in adults aged 25\u201349 years. Males had higher rates than females (mortality: 0.78 vs. 0.48 per 100,000; DALYs: 42.4 vs. 27.0 per 100,000), though females experienced steeper declines (EAPC_mortality: \u22121.78%). The highest burden was in the 45\u201349 age group (deaths: 9,768; DALYs: 474,092). From 1990 to 2021, high-SDI regions achieved the greatest reductions in mortality (\u221250.3%) and DALYs (\u221246.8%), while low-SDI regions saw increases in deaths (+109.5%) and DALYs (+114.7%). Nationally, Zimbabwe and Guatemala showed the sharpest increases in mortality (EAPC: +4.71% and +3.76%), while Sweden and Swiss Confederation achieved the greatest declines (EAPC: \u22125.5% and \u22124.9%). Forecasts suggest continued global declines by 2050, but widening disparities by sex, age, and socio-demographic status.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of SAH attributable to high SBP is decreasing, young and middle-aged adults-especially males and those in low-SDI regions-continue to face substantial risks. Targeted hypertension control and region-specific prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "title": "Autism spectrum disorder and the role of nuclear hormone receptors: insights and therapeutic implications",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental condition known to impact a person's learning, communication, and interpersonal interactions. Recent research has highlighted the role of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) in neurodevelopment and synaptic function, suggesting their potential involvement in ASD pathophysiology. NHRs regulate gene expression that are critical for neural differentiation, plasticity, and metabolic processes. Dysregulation of these receptors can lead to altered neural circuit formation and neurotransmitter imbalances, which are commonly observed in ASD. Understanding the interplay between NHRs and ASD could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions, providing hope for more personalized approaches to managing the disorder. One key receptor is retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA), which was shown to be reduced in individuals with ASD. Among its numerous functions during development, RORA was shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic function, and neuroprotection. Studies have identified that RORA expression is reduced in individuals with ASD, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, affecting transcription of multiple ASD-associated genes. In the present review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms leading to ASD pathophysiology, various treatment modalities, the prospects of the RORA gene therapy approach, and future perspectives.",

      "title": "Geometric and dosimetric evaluation of auto-segmentation of brain arteriovenous malformations using multimodal imaging in stereotactic radiosurgery",
      "content": "BackgroundOptimizing radiation dose to protect white matter (WM) tracts during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) necessitates the integration of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based WM tractography to delineate WM tracts and establish dose constraints. Conventional manual delineation of perilesional targets demonstrated significant operational inefficiency, primarily attributed to the complex structural interdigitation between pathological vasculature and eloquent brain areas.PurposeThis study aimed to develop a two-stage deep learning (DL) method that combines a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net detection-aided and three-dimensional (3D) self-attention segmentation model for automatic bAVM segmentation. This method focuses on improving efficiency in clinical practice while protecting WM tracts using multimodal imaging and WM tractography in SRS.MethodsWe analyzed imaging data from 191 patients who underwent CyberKnife-based SRS at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, with bAVMs closely adjacent to WM tracts. A total of 153 patients were used to construct a two-stage DL model to segment the bAVMs on multimodal imaging and WM tractography, while the remaining 38 patients were utilized to validate the model's performance. We introduced spatial and channel attention modules in the U-Net variant, along with a versatile \u201cAttentional ResBlock,\u201d achieving parameter efficiency through cross-dimensional interaction while preserving model fidelity. The accuracy of the auto-segmented contours is evaluated using geometric indices and dosimetric endpoints.ResultsOur proposed model demonstrated superior segmentation performance, achieving a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.84 \u00b1 0.05, sensitivity of 0.92 \u00b1 0.09, and F2-score of 0.79 \u00b1 0.08. Furthermore, it attained a low Hausdorff distance (4.55 \u00b1 1.14 mm) and mean surface distance (0.53 \u00b1 0.08 mm), indicating exceptional boundary delineation precision. The difference in the proportion of WM tracts within the target region between manual and our automated contours is minimal (0.08 \u00b1 0.13). Meanwhile, strong concordance is observed between auto-segmented and manually contoured targets across the majority of dosimetric endpoints, with a mean difference of 0.46 Gy. The received dose of WM tracts in the two comparison plans also has an acceptable representation of dosimetric parameters (R2 = 0.92 for Dmean and 0.88 for V1Gy). Dose exposition of the organ at risk (OAR) shows no statistically significant differences in treatment plans with auto-segmentation targets compared to regular plans.ConclusionThe reliable bAVM automated-segmentation method has been validated and may support SRS planning for bAVMs and thus avoid neurological sequelae after SRS in considering WM tracts protection.",

      "title": "Deep learning in intracranial EEG for seizure detection: advances, challenges, and clinical applications",
      "content": "Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the automated detection and classification of seizure events from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In this review, we synthesize recent advancements in deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) units, and transformer based architectures that enable accurate localization of epileptogenic zones (EZ) in drug resistant epilepsy. These approaches effectively extract spatial and temporal features from raw iEEG signals to detect epileptiform discharges (ED) including seizures alongside other electro-physiological biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Importantly, beyond relying solely on these traditional markers, several studies have indicated direct seizure detection by modeling ictal and preictal dynamics. Such methods capture alternative biomarkers including spectral changes, connectivity patterns, and complex temporal signatures that directly reflect seizure activity. Although deep learning models often achieve high accuracy, they continue to face several challenges due to data scarcity, heterogeneity in iEEG acquisition, inconsistent preprocessing protocols, and limited model interpretability. We also highlight emerging integrative strategies that combine multimodal neuroimaging data with deep learning analyses as well as neuromorphic computing techniques designed for real-time clinical application. Addressing these limitations has significant potential for surgical planning, reducing diagnostic subjectivity, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in epilepsy care.",

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications.
