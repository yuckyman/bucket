      "title": "Evaluating group interactions in epileptic brain networks by hypergraph and higher-order homophily",
      "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

      "title": "Oscillatory brain activity reflects semantic and phonological activation during sentence planning.",
      "content": "Verbal short-term memory includes resources for maintaining semantic and phonological information. These resources are complementary and often activated simultaneously, making their anatomical bases difficult to determine. We mapped the neural representation of semantic and phonological short-term memory by recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) data while participants rehearsed short formulaic 5-word sentences like \"The mouse ate the cheese.\" During a memory delay period, participants exhibited bilateral temporofrontal event-related desynchronization (ERD, power decrease) in the alpha and beta bands (8-30 Hz). During the memory delay, participants also heard an auditory distractor word that could be unrelated to the sentence, semantically related to one of the words in the rehearsed sentence (e.g. \"rat\" or \"butter\"), or phonologically related to one of the words in the sentence (e.g. \"mountain\" or \"cheap\"). Relative to unrelated words, related words induced a greater degree of ERD immediately following their presentation. Effects of semantic distractors were exclusively in the temporal lobe, largely in the left middle temporal gyrus but also in bilateral medial temporal regions. Effects of phonological distractors were far more widespread in temporal, frontal, and parietal regions, and were largely left-lateralized. As no behavioural effects were observed in cued sentence repetition, it seems that auditory distractors produce short-lasting interference with a verbal memory trace that is ultimately resolved, but useful for mapping regions involved in maintaining distinct aspects of the sentence content.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Coordinated multilaminar dynamics underlie multiplexed computation in motor cortex",
      "content": "Functional multiplexing is a signature of higher-order brain regions. Beyond single-unit mixed selectivity, the six-layered cortical microcircuit has been proposed as an optimal substrate for such parallel computations. Recurrent connections within and across layers allow cortical columns to retain incoming information for some time and integrate it into stable latent representations, thereby acting as functional units. The key question is whether the multiplexing capacity arises from specialized processing within individual layers or the collective coordination of multi-layer activity patterns. Here, we analyzed laminar recordings from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-sample task. We identified laminarly distributed, behaviorally specific subspaces that captured the encoding of distinct task-related variables. These subspaces, spanning the entire column and expressed as coordinated activity patterns, were functionally reused to encode the same variable over time and flexibly recycled to encode new ones. Subtle variations of laminar weights gave rise to multiple coexistent laminar coding subspaces, enabling multiplexing at the columnar level. Task-related information propagated across layers in temporally organized trajectories that transiently localized in superficial or deep layers at distinct trial epochs. These organized laminar trajectories were consistently observed across recording sites, but exhibited site-specific propagation patterns. The activity of the population on the other hand lacked structured dynamics. Thus, laminar trajectories of information emerged atop a background of spatially and temporally unspecific activity-fluctuations.",

      "title": "Language usage modulates the neural mechanisms ofselective attention in bilinguals",
      "content": "The use of multiple languages modulates the neural mechanisms of selective attention, but it is unclear whether these adaptations require continuous engagement and active second language usage. Here we examined whether language usage shapes selective attention in bilingualism, and what neural processes might this engage. 48 highly proficient English-French bilinguals listened to naturalistic speech streams in their first or second language, paired with either linguistic and non-linguistic interference. Participants were matched on their L2 proficiency, but were either Active, Moderate, or Inactive users of their second language. The results revealed usage-related modulation of oscillatory activity in the alpha band, with more efficient inhibitory control in Active and Moderate users leading to behavioural resilience to interference. In contrast, usage did not affect lower-level perceptual tracking of speech, as captured by mTRF decoding of speech envelopes across frequency bands. Taken together, our findings show that resilience to interference during language processing is not dependent on the perceptual speech tracking, but rather on the capacity to recruit higher-level attentional control mechanisms, a process that is dynamically shaped by bilinguals L2 usage.",

      "title": "A cholinergic mechanism orchestrating task-dependent computation across the cortex",
      "content": "In an ever-changing environment, animals often need to switch between performing different tasks involving distinct sets of cognitive processes. Many such tasks involve neural activity distributed across the cortex, with dynamics that depend on both task demands and behavioral strategy. A fundamental but unanswered question is what circuit mechanisms orchestrate these task-dependent dynamics. Here, we hypothesized that acetylcholine release in the cortex plays a key role. The cortex's only long-range source of this neuromodulator is the basal forebrain cholinergic system, which targets the entire cortical sheet and can individually modulate single regions on sub-second timescales. To test our hypothesis, we first imaged cholinergic axons innervating the cortex while mice switched frequently between two navigational decision-making tasks in virtual reality (VR), only one of which required gradual accumulation of sensory evidence. We found that cholinergic input to the cortex is spatiotemporally heterogeneous and multiplexes sensory, motor, arousal, and cognitive signals in a task- and strategy-dependent fashion, with overall higher activity during evidence accumulation. Crucially, beyond contextual variables, cholinergic activity directly tracked task computations themselves, encoding an evidence-dependent decision variable only in the accumulation task. To test if acetylcholine release is causal to the performance of each task, we optogenetically silenced cholinergic terminals in the cortex while simultaneously imaging excitatory cortical activity. We found that this input is selectively required for evidence accumulation, and for large-scale cortical coding of evidence and choice during the accumulation task. Thus, we have identified a new cholinergic mechanism that orchestrates cortex-wide activity in a task-dependent manner and serves as a key node in the distributed brain network underlying the accumulation of sensory evidence.",

      "title": "Decoding the neural stages from action and object recognition to mentalizing",
      "content": "Higher-level action interpretation, such as inferring underlying intentions and predicting future actions, requires the integration of conceptual action information (e.g. \"opening\") with semantic knowledge about persons and objects (e.g. \"my friend Anna\", \"pizza box\"). However, how the neural systems for action and object recognition and memory interact with each other to form the basis for inferring higher-level mental states remains unclear. Here we use fMRI-based crossmodal multiple regression representational similarity analysis in human female and male participants to elucidate the processing stages from basic action and object recognition to mentalizing. We show that inferring intentions from observed actions or written sentences involves a modality-general network of lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal brain regions associated with conceptual action and object representation and mentalizing. The representational profiles in these regions are explained by models capturing different types of conceptual information, revealing distinct but partially overlapping networks for action, object, and mental state representation. There was no strict separation of networks for action, object, and mental state representations, arguing against a sequential bottom-up hierarchy from action and object understanding pathways to the mentalizing network. Rather, left-hemispheric regions, specifically ventrolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior lateral occipitotemporal cortex, showed strong representational overlap, pointing towards a core network for making meaning of action-object structures at a conceptual level. We argue that this core network represents a distributional semantic hub between classic networks for action and object understanding and the mentalizing network.",
