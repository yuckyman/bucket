      "content": "<p>Successful navigation and interactions with objects in a complex, three-dimensional (3D) world are essential to survival, yet studies of the neural basis of visual perception and action often treat the world as a flat, two-dimensional (2D) canvas. Here, we review recent discoveries about how the visual systems of different mammals have adapted under the constraint of a 3D world. Many neurons in primate visual cortex are sensitive to 3D depth cues constructed from input differences to the two eyes (binocular disparities). Similar neuronal selectivity has recently been characterized in tree shrews and mice, though constrained anatomically and functionally. Disparity-sensitive receptive field structures can now be assessed noninvasively across human visual cortex and functionally linked to depth perception. At later stages in the nonhuman primate (NHP) ventral (\"what\") pathway, supporting object recognition, complex 3D objects are represented as spatial configurations of geometric parts. In studies of the dorsal (\"where\"/\"how\") pathway of NHPs, underlying visuospatial processing, the inclusion of 3D structure in visual tasks has established tighter links between neuronal mechanisms and perception. This has also revealed neuronal representations of 3D object position and orientation that are tolerant to 3D gaze location, providing a basis for robust perception and action. The cross-species analysis presented here provides new perspectives on neural coding mechanisms underpinning the richness of 3D visual experience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential for understanding the neural basis of cognition and behavior, which in turn will enable the development of therapies and neuroprosthetics for those suffering from visual impairments.</p>",

      "title": "Circuit-Based Approaches to Understanding the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)",
      "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is essential for monitoring ongoing behavior, regulating affect, and guiding social interactions. Altered ACC structure and function are implicated in a host of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder. Thus, cross talk between basic and translational research is needed to drive the next generation of treatments. The human and nonhuman primate ACC is large and can be subdivided based on anatomical structure and connectivity. Increasingly, studies of the ACC point to unique functions for its distinct areas. This review highlights recent work aimed at understanding of the structure and function of distinct portions of the ACC and the role of these regions in cognition and affect in higher species. We focus on the roles and subregions that might guide the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. This includes discussion of in-depth anatomical investigations that have revealed that distinct portions of the subgenual and perigenual ACC areas are driven by unique afferent paths. Furthermore, we describe neurophysiological recordings of single-neuron and local field potential activity, combined with carefully designed behavioral tasks or novel approaches to discerning affective states, which have revealed the neural mechanisms engaged in ACC during affective experience and assessment of conspecifics. We present noninvasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches that target the ACC to treat depression and have been shown to be most effective when they change activity within subgenual parts of ACC and may structurally remodel the connections of this area. Finally, we review new approaches to uncover upstream drivers and downstream effectors of ACC activity in higher species, including functional changes implicated in health, disease, and recovery.</p>",

      "title": "Not Just Neurons: Pain Is Orchestrated in Partnership with Many Non-neuronal Cells",
      "content": "<p>Pain is a symptom common to a wide variety of conditions and one that severely impacts an individual's everyday life, as well as having broader socioeconomic repercussions. In recent years, there has been spectacularly rapid progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of sensory neuron function and pain in preclinical models. However, the number of analgesics interacting with novel targets that have received regulatory approval in recent years has been limited. Examples include monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies disrupting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling for treating migraine and, most recently, suzetrigine, a small molecular inhibitor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 subunit. In this review, we step away from focusing on the sensory neuron as the transmitter of nociceptive information and examine the role of non-neuronal cells in modulating sensory neuron activity. One potential appeal of disrupting the activity of peripherally located non-neuronal cells is the likely bypassing of side effects associated with modulating a target receptor that is expressed by neurons within both the peripheral and central nervous systems, although targeting of peripheral, non-neuronal cells will not of course necessarily be side effect-free. Here, we examine the key roles of non-neuronal cells in orchestrating pain across a diverse set of conditions, from joint pain to bone pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, Fabry disease, and chronic pain in general.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The ventral hippocampus (vHPC), initially implicated in anxiety regulation, is now recognized for its broader role in integrating emotional, motivational, and contextual information. This review synthesizes recent insights from rodent research presented at our 2025 Society for Neuroscience minisymposium, detailing how local inhibitory microcircuits, long-range projection&ndash;defined pathways, and neuromodulatory inputs interact to shape fear, anxiety, and reward behaviors. We emphasize how distinct circuits segregate fear and anxiety, resolve approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, and integrate reward history. Serotonergic modulation, particularly from the median raphe, emerges as a critical regulator of vHPC dynamics, with pronounced sex-specific functional implications. Finally, we examine how vCA1 ensemble activity encodes emotionally salient stimuli and supports latent state inference, thereby enabling flexible decision-making under uncertainty. Collectively, these findings recast the vHPC as a modular, computationally rich structure essential for adaptive behavior, which may provide new insights into circuit-level dysfunction in affective disorders.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex&mdash;especially in primates&mdash;underpins the emergence of advanced cognitive abilities. This process involved not only increased cortical surface area and neuronal output but also enhanced structural adaptations, such as cortical folding and glial morphological complexity. In this review, we examine the central roles of radial glia (RG) and astrocytes in driving neocortical expansion and evolution. We highlight the emergence of primate- and human-specific genes, which contribute to enhanced RG proliferation and neurogenesis in these species. We further explore how epigenetic regulation and dynamic chromatin architecture modulate RG behavior across species. At the cellular level, we discuss how morphological features&mdash;particularly the basal processes and specialized protrusions of RG&mdash;facilitate access to diverse extrinsic signals, promoting proliferative capacity and cortical complexity. We then turn to cortical folding, focusing on the role of astrocytes, and the functional relevance of folds in supporting brain homeostasis. Finally, we address astrocyte diversity, development, and evolutionary adaptation, with special emphasis on sex differences and primate-specific features. Comparative transcriptomic and morphological studies reveal that human astrocytes exhibit unique molecular signatures, expanded metabolic capacity, and higher morphological complexity. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted contributions of RG and astrocytes to the evolutionary elaboration of the neocortex. They further provide a framework for understanding how cellular innovations shaped the modern primate brain in general, and human brain specifically.</p>",

      "title": "Activity Deprivation Modulates the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR5 Signaling Pathway to Enable Synaptic Upscaling",
      "content": "<p>Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates postsynaptic strength to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling. Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling in cultured rat neurons of either sex. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Furthermore, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3 and thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluRs that are necessary for upscaling. Altogether, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling is thought to require agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up- and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.</p>",

      "title": "Behavior-Relevant Periodized Neural Representation of Acoustic But Not Tactile Rhythm in Humans",
      "content": "<p>Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat and the related \"periodized\" neural representation are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex. The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15&nbsp;Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior. In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25&nbsp;Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization and yielded less stable tapping. Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat. Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses. More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.</p>",

      "title": "Neural Sensitivity to the Heartbeat Is Modulated by Fluctuations in Affective Arousal during Spontaneous Thought",
      "content": "<p>Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 males, 20 females) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudorandom intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including the heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340&ndash;356&nbsp;ms window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal&mdash;a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.</p>",

      "title": "Collapsing Perisomatic Inhibition Leads to Epileptic Fast-Ripple Oscillations Caused by Pseudosynchronous Firing of CA3 Pyramidal Neurons",
      "content": "<p>Diverse network oscillations, thought to represent different information processing modes of cortical networks, are accompanied by synchronous neuronal activity at various temporal scales. Sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, supporting memory consolidation in the hippocampus, are among the fastest physiological oscillations characterized by strong interneuronal synchrony. In contrast, when hippocampal activity turns epileptic, pathological fast-ripple oscillations appear. The distinction of the two oscillations is diagnostically relevant; however, how differential mechanisms of the same network generate the two activities is not well understood. Here we addressed this question using an in vitro hippocampal model that allowed targeted recording of cell types and local pharmacological manipulations in mice of either sex. We showed that inhibition did not contribute to current and rhythm generation of fast-ripples, unlike physiological ripple oscillations. Instead, pathological fast-ripples emerged when perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells collapsed and depended on the quasi-simultaneous onset of stereotypical pyramidal cell (PC) bursts leading to pseudosynchrony. This was accompanied by a loss of spatial coherence. In epileptogenic conditions, deep CA3 PCs selectively ramped up their burst activity before fast-ripple onset, while normally nonbursting superficial PCs acquired burst capability. These results point to PC pseudosynchrony as the underlying mechanism of fast-ripples, with differential contribution of known PC types.</p>",
