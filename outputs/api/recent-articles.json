      "title": "The combination of elevated neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage induces Pink1-dependent mitophagy in axons",
      "content": "Mitochondria are critical for synaptic function. At the synapse, mitochondria produce ATP and buffer calcium, both of which are required for synapse function. Defects in mitochondrial maintenance are linked to neurodegenerative disease, yet we know little about what regulates the need for mitophagy at the synapse. We assessed the impact of neuron type, activity, and mitochondrial damage on mitophagy rate in axons of larval zebrafish. Using electron and confocal microscopy, we show that mitophagy occurs in the axon terminal of postsynaptic sensory neurons and presynaptic motor neurons at similar rates. Increasing neuronal activity or mitochondria damage does not impact the amount of mitophagy in axons. Only by combining neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage does the rate of mitophagy increase in the axon and this increase requires Pink1. Together, our data support a model in which increased mitophagic demand in axons is rare and uniquely sensitive to Pink1 disruption.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to exhibit amyloid pathology years before the onset of cognitive impairment. While early detection and pathological modification are considered essential for suppressing or preventing disease progression, effective strategies remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether inducing a hibernation-like state via Q neuron-induced hypometabolism/hypothermia state (QIH) suppresses the progression of early amyloid pathology in AD model mice. To maximize the total duration of QIH, we established and implemented a repetitive QIH (rQIH) protocol. Using 82E1 antibody immunostaining, we found that rQIH significantly reduced early amyloid plaque burden, and the magnitude of this suppression was positively correlated with rQIH duration. rQIH also decreased the formation of dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. These findings demonstrate that a hibernation-like physiological state can attenuate early amyloid pathology, providing a potential foundation for future hibernation-based therapeutic strategies for AD.",

      "title": "Spatial and temporal contexts drive visual temporal integration via spatiotemporal normalisation",
      "content": "The visual system is known to integrate sensory information across both space and time, but these dimensions are often studied separately. Here we provide novel behavioural evidence for an early integration over space and time, and propose a computational model of this integration that is biologically plausible. We designed a controlled task that forces human participants to integrate information over both space and time to perform well. Stimuli were temporally segmented rings of oriented elements and participants had to detect a missing element in the ring. We found that temporal integration was enhanced when successive visual events were temporally proximate, spatially aligned to form a continuous contour, but also, and more surprisingly, when they were brief. Notably, the spatial effects on integration are temporally asymmetric: integration is facilitated when more events are presented earlier in the sequence, and even more so when they form a collinear contour. These findings indicate that temporal integration is sensitive to both the spatial configuration and the number of visual events presented over time, supporting a continuous rather than discrete process at early visual stages. All of these results are well accounted for by a computational model in which temporal integration arises from the overlap of internal signals generated by individual visual events. These signals are shaped by a spatially and temporally tuned divisive normalisation mechanism and integrated via coincidence detection. Predictions from this model match human performance in seminal past work as well as novel stimulus displays, offering an account of how spatio temporal interactions determine what we perceive and when.",

      "title": "Cortical spectral rebalancing underlies pregabalin's efficacy in restless legs syndrome",
      "content": "Restless legs syndrome afflicts nearly half of all patients with end-stage renal disease, imposing profound burdens through relentless insomnia and functional decline. Dopaminergic agents--the established first-line therapy--trigger augmentation, a paradoxical intensification of symptoms that leaves patients worse than when they began treatment. The resultant therapeutic impasse has left a vulnerable population without effective recourse. Here we demonstrate that pregabalin, an alpha2delta; calcium channel ligand with established renal safety, provides robust and sustained symptom relief in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dialysis patients with uremic restless legs syndrome. Clinical benefits emerged rapidly and intensified over three months, with pregabalin-treated patients showing more than twofold greater likelihood of categorical improvement in disease severity. In complementary animal electrophysiology experiments, pregabalin distinctively suppressed cortical hyperarousal--a hallmark of restless legs syndrome--by rebalancing low- and high-frequency oscillatory activity patterns, particularly in motor regions. This neural signature closely resembled that of gabapentin, another therapeutically effective alpha2delta ligand, suggesting convergent mechanisms. Beyond establishing pregabalin as an urgently needed alternative to dopaminergic therapy, our results demonstrate that cortical oscillatory profiling can reveal mechanistic convergence among candidate therapeutics, offering a rational preclinical screening strategy for neurological disorders before exposure of high-risk patient populations to experimental interventions. This framework may accelerate therapeutic discovery while reducing clinical trial risks in vulnerable populations.",

      "title": "A shared ensemble in the prelimbic cortex links impulsivity and anxiety-like behavior.",
      "content": "Mental health disorders often share overlapping behavioral and neural features, yet it remains unclear why these relationships emerge or whether they reflect common underlying neural processes. To explore this, we recorded prelimbic (PL) activity using endoscopic calcium imaging as rats completed a battery of tasks assessing impulsivity, distress tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, incentive salience (Pavlovian conditioned approach), and sensation-seeking in a novel environment (locomotor activity). By collecting neural and behavioral measures across all tasks within each animal, we were able to investigate whether PL activity tracked processes that were either unique to individual behaviors, shared across multiple behaviors, or both. We found that PL activity was significantly predictive of each of the behaviors except locomotor activity. Subsequent analyses revealed shared behavioral structure across tasks, with one latent dimension reflecting high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. Individual variability across this particular dimension was strongly predicted by a neural structure comprising shared PL activity across four of the behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship was driven by a subset of PL neurons that shared patterns of activity across multiple tasks, forming a shared neural ensemble. Importantly, animals with a greater tendency to share neural ensembles exhibited a stronger link between high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a small, shared ensemble of PL neurons tracked activity across multiple clinically-relevant behaviors to predict an approach/avoidance phenotype characterized by high impulsivity and low anxiety. This points toward a targetable neural population that may help explain why diverse psychiatric symptoms often co-occur within individuals.",

We usually throw that information away and rely on external docs, tribal knowledge, or comments.</p> <p>So I implemented TypeID for Python and an experimental layer on top of it that explores the idea of explainable identifiers.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>You can get a structured answer, for example:</p> <ul> <li>what kind of entity this ID represents (via prefix)</li> <li>when it was likely created (from the sortable component)</li> <li>whether it is time-sortable</li> <li>whether it\u2019s safe to expose publicly</li> <li>what guarantees it provides (uniqueness, randomness, monotonicity)</li> <li>what spec / format it follows</li> </ul> <p>Without database access, btw.</p> <p>It might be used for debugging logs where all you have is an ID.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <ol> <li>Install the library with yaml support:</li> </ol> <p><code>bash pip install typeid-python[yaml] </code></p> <ol> <li>Use TypeID as a user's id:</li> </ol> <p>```python from dataclasses import dataclass, field from typing import Literal from typeid import TypeID, typeid_factory</p> <p>UserID = TypeID[Literal[&quot;user&quot;]] gen_user_id = typeid_factory(&quot;user&quot;)</p> <p>@dataclass class UserDTO: user_id: UserID = field(default_factory=gen_user_id) full_name: str = &quot;A J&quot;

      "title": "vresto: Python toolkit for searching, downloading and analyzing Satellite Data",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><strong>vresto</strong> is a Python toolkit that simplifies working with individual satellite products (mainly) from the Copernicus Sentinel program, with a current focus on Sentinel2 (L1C and L2A products). It provides three interfaces:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Web Interface</strong> \u2013 An interactive map-based UI (<code>niceGUI</code>) to visually search and filter satellite products by location, date range, and cloud cover. <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto/blob/main/docs/assets/vresto_demo.gif\">Demo here</a></li> <li><strong>Python API</strong> \u2013 Clean, programmatic access for automation and batch processing</li> <li><strong>CLI</strong> \u2013 Command-line tools for quick searches and downloads</li> </ol> <p>Key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Search satellite products by name or geographic location</li> <li>Download individual spectral bands (RGB, infrared, etc.) for analysis and artifact detection</li> <li>Access metadata and quicklook previews</li> <li>Inspect and visualize Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A imagery (with support for more coming later)</li> <li>Handle S3 authentication securely</li> </ul> <h1>Why I built this</h1> <p>This came from a real need when exploring and cleaning large satellite datasets for ML model training: researchers and developers need a fast, intuitive way to find <strong>individual</strong> products, inspect their bands for quality issues, and download specific data\u2014without context-switching between multiple tools and programming languages.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>ML/AI researchers</strong> \u2013 Building datasets from satellite imagery and need to explore/clean individual products</li> <li><strong>Geospatial researchers &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Analyzing multispectral imagery for environmental monitoring, agriculture, or climate research</li> <li><strong>GIS developers &amp; engineers</strong> \u2013 Building Python applications that need streamlined satellite data discovery and access</li> <li><strong>Data analysts &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Working with remote sensing data for analysis and visualization</li> <li><strong>Hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts</strong> \u2013 Anyone curious about satellite data and earth observation</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The most popular alternatives to searching Satellite products with Python (and offering a CLI) are <a href=\"https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag\">eodag</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/CDSETool/CDSETool\">CDSETool</a>. The former seems to be a quite mature project with a complete suite that goes beyond the scope of &quot;single products&quot;, while the latter focuses more on product downloads. Neither offers an intuitive web interface like that of vresto. However, an integration with <code>eodag</code> could be interesting in the future to combine the best of both worlds.</p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <p><code>vresto</code> is built on top of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem catalog, providing an intuitive Python-first interface for the most common tasks: finding individual products, examining their metadata and spectral bands, and downloading what you need. Whether you prefer clicking on a map, writing a few lines of Python, or using the CLI, <code>vresto</code> keeps you focused on the data rather than the infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd17 <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto\">github.com/kalfasyan/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 <strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://kalfasyan.github.io/vresto\">kalfasyan.github.io/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udce6 <strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/vresto/\">pypi.org/project/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f <strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/\">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Free Copernicus account required (get one at dataspace.copernicus.eu).
