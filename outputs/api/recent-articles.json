      "title": "A unified model of short- and long-term plasticity: Effects on network connectivity and information capacity",
      "content": "Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is a fundamental learning mechanism that shapes connectivity and activity of neural circuits. Existing computational models of Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) model long-term synaptic changes with varying degree of biological details. A common approach is to neglect the influence of short-term dynamics on long-term plasticity, which may represent an oversimplification for certain neuron types. Thus, there is a need for new models to investigate how short-term dynamics influence long-term plasticity. To this end, we introduce a novel phenomenological model, the Short-Long-Term STDP (SL-STDP) rule, which directly integrates short-term dynamics with postsynaptic long-term plasticity. We fit the new model to layer 5 visual cortex recordings and study how the short-term plasticity affects the firing rate frequency dependence of long-term plasticity in a single synapse. Our analysis reveals that the pre- and postsynaptic frequency dependence of the long-term plasticity plays a crucial role in shaping the self-organization of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their information processing through the emergence of sinks and source nodes. We applied the SL-STDP rule to RNNs and found that the neurons of SL-STDP network self-organized into distinct firing rate clusters, stabilizing the dynamics and preventing connection weights from exploding. We extended the experimentation by including homeostatic balancing, namely weight normalization and excitatory-to-inhibitory plasticity and found differences in degree correlations between the SL-STDP network and a network without the direct coupling between short-term and long-term plasticity. Finally, we evaluated how the modified connectivity affects networks' information capacities in reservoir computing tasks. The SL-STDP rule outperformed the uncoupled system in majority of the tasks and including excitatory-to-inhibitory facilitating synapses further improved information capacities. Our study demonstrates that short-term dynamics-induced changes in the frequency dependence of long-term plasticity play a pivotal role in shaping network dynamics and link synaptic mechanisms to information processing in RNNs.",

      "title": "Next-generation enhancer AAVs for selective interspecies targeting of midbrain dopaminergic neurons",
      "content": "To enable genetic access without genetically engineered animals, we developed and benchmarked enhancer-AAVs for selectively targeting dopamine (DA) neurons across mice and marmosets. 12 DA enhancer candidates were nominated through integrated single-nucleus RNA-seq/ATAC-seq analysis of marmoset ventral midbrain tissue. We identified two leads (cjDAE8, cjDAE4) by systemic AAV delivery and dual-color fluorescence screening in mice. Local co-injection of both AAVs in marmoset confirmed DA-restricted expression, with cjDAE8 exhibiting higher specificity. However, antibody amplification of reporter fluorescence exposed weakly labeled off-target cells (leaky expression). We therefore engineered next-generation AAV backbones for cjDAE8 to strengthen expression while limiting leakiness. Quantitative histology comparing natural versus antibody-amplified fluorescence defined AAV doses for achieving both high efficiency and greater than 90-95% specificity of DA neuron labeling across injection routes. We demonstrate applications for (i) retrograde targeting of projection-defined DA populations in marmoset, (ii) fiber-photometric recording of divergent DA-axonal dynamics in mouse striatal subregions, and (iii) driving optogenetic VTA DA self-stimulation. Our results provide a resource for interspecies DA targeting and two practical guidelines: backbone context critically shapes enhancer performance, and antibody-amplified readouts rigorously assesses specificity.",

      "content": "The aim of this study was to explore the function of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) on retinal neuron damage induced by retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Microglia-specific RIPK3 knockout (KO) mice were employed to establish retinal IR models. Retinal structural and functional status was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining along with electroretinogram. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was employed to detect the situations of...",

However, the low number of discrete phosphenes that can be simultaneously elicited in practice makes encoding of whole objects difficult, hindering recognition. Hence, we aim at determining the minimal number of discrete visual elements needed for object recognition. To answer this question, we replaced object contours by a varying number of round...",
