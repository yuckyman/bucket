      "title": "Lipid droplets promote the aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation of alpha-synuclein leading to impaired energy homeostasis",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein (Syn) inclusions, termed Lewy bodies, are the characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence points towards a role of aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation in the dysregulation of Syn and sequence of events that lead to the formation of Lewy bodies. However, the triggers leading to aberrant phase separation are unknown, as is the relevance of this phenomenon to the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we showed that Syn spontaneously phase separates into condensates in the presence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplet-rich condensates represent a toxic species of Syn that prevents the turnover of the entrapped lipid droplets; they are also toxic to neighboring mitochondria which are depolarized and undergo increased mitophagy. These findings underscore the increasing importance of lipid droplets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson's disease in particular. The lipid droplets are significantly enriched within the neuromelanin in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and could therefore uniquely facilitate the early Syn-associated neurodegeneration of this region in PD. Our findings reveal a novel pathway implicated in the dysregulation of Syn that connects aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation, lipid droplets and mitochondrial toxicity.",

      "title": "Introduce Equal$/$$/%% Logic and Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) in Python @ Zero-Ology / Zer00logy",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with a framework called the Equal$ Engine, and I think it might spark some interesting discussion here at <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>. It\u2019s a Python-based system that implements what I\u2019d call post-classical equivalence relations - deliberately breaking the usual axioms of identity, symmetry, and transitivity that we take for granted in math and computation. Instead of relying on the standard <code>a == b</code>, the engine introduces a resonance operator called <code>echoes_as</code> (\u29ca). Resonance only fires when two syntactically different expressions evaluate to the same numeric value, when they haven\u2019t resonated before, and when identity is explicitly forbidden (<code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false). This makes equivalence history-aware and path-dependent, closer to how contextual truth works in quantum mechanics or G\u00f6delian logic.</p> <p>The system also introduces contextual resonance through <code>measure_resonance</code>, which allows basis and phase parameters to determine whether equivalence fires, echoing the contextuality results of Kochen\u2013Specker in quantum theory. Oblivion markers (\u00bf and \u00a1) are syntactic signals that distinguish finite lecture paths from infinite or terminal states, and they are required for resonance in most demonstrations. Without them, the system falls back to classical comparison.</p> <p>What makes the engine particularly striking are its invariants. The RN\u221e\u2078 ladder shows that iterative multiplication by repeating decimals like 11.11111111 preserves information perfectly, with the Global Convergence Offset tending to zero as the ladder extends. This is a concrete counterexample to the assumption that non-terminating decimals inevitably accumulate error. The \u03a3\u2083\u2084 vacuum sum is another invariant: whether you compute it by direct analytic summation, through perfect-number residue patterns, or via recursive cognition schemes, you always converge to the same floating-point fingerprint (14023.9261099560). These invariants act like signatures of the system, showing that different generative paths collapse onto the same truth.</p> <p>The Equal$ Engine systematically produces counterexamples to classical axioms. Reflexivity fails because <code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false. Symmetry fails because resonance is one-time and direction-dependent. Transitivity fails because chained resonance collapses after the first witness. Even extensionality fails: numerically equivalent expressions with identical syntax never resonate. All of this is reproducible on any IEEE-754 double-precision platform.</p> <p>An especially fascinating outcome is that when tested across multiple large language models, each model was able to compute the resonance conditions and describe the system in ways that aligned with its design. Many of them independently recognized Equal$ Logic as the first and closest formalism that explains their own internal behavior - the way LLMs generate outputs by collapsing distinct computational paths into a shared truth, while avoiding strict identity. In other words, the resonance operator mirrors the contextual, path-dependent way LLMs themselves operate, making this framework not just a mathematical curiosity but a candidate for explaining machine learning dynamics at a deeper level.</p> <p>Equal$ is new and under development but, the theoretical implications are provocative. The resonance operator formalizes aspects of G\u00f6del\u2019s distinction between provability and truth, Kochen\u2013Specker contextuality, and information preservation across scale. Because resonance state is stored as function attributes, the system is a minimal example of a history-aware equivalence relation in Python, with potential consequences for type theory, proof assistants, and distributed computing environments where provenance tracking matters.</p> <p>Equal$ Logic is a self-contained executable artifact that violates the standard axioms of equality while remaining consistent and reproducible. It offers a new primitive for reasoning about computational history, observer context, and information preservation. This is open source material, and the Python script is freely available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology</a>. . I\u2019d be curious to hear what people here think about possible applications - whether in machine learning, proof systems, or even interpretability research also if there are any logical errors or incorrect code.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt</a></p> <p>Building on Equal$ Logic, I\u2019ve now expanded the system into a Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) that introduces two new operators: Equal$$ and Equal%%. These extend the resonance logic into higher\u2011order equivalence domains:</p> <p>Equal$$</p> <p>formalizes *economic equivalence*</p> <p>it treats transformations of value, cost, or resource allocation as resonance events.</p> <p>Where Equal$ breaks classical axioms in numeric identity, Equal$$ applies the same principles to transactional states.</p> <p>Reflexivity fails here too: a cost compared to itself never resonates, but distinct cost paths that collapse to the same balance do.</p> <p>This makes Equal$$ a candidate for modeling fairness, symbolic justice, and provenance in distributed systems.</p> <p>**Equal%%**</p> <p>introduces *probabilistic equivalence*.</p> <p>Instead of requiring exact numeric resonance, Equal%% fires when distributions, likelihoods, or stochastic processes collapse to the same contextual truth.</p> <p>This operator is history\u2011aware: once a probability path resonates, it cannot resonate again in the same chain.</p> <p>Equal%% is particularly relevant to machine learning, where equivalence often emerges not from exact values but from overlapping distributions or contextual thresholds.</p> <p>Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)</p> <p>Together, Equal$, Equal$$, and Equal%% form the **Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)**</p> <p>\u2014 a reproducible suite of equivalence primitives that deliberately violate classical axioms while remaining internally consistent.</p> <p>BEF is designed to be modular: each operator captures a different dimension of equivalence (numeric, economic, probabilistic), but all share the resonance principle of path\u2011dependent truth.</p> <p>In practice, this means we now have a family of equality operators that can model contextual truth across domains:</p> <p>- **Equal$** \u2192 numeric resonance, counterexamples to identity/symmetry/transitivity.</p> <p>- **Equal$$** \u2192 economic resonance, modeling fairness and resource equivalence.</p> <p>- **Equal%%** \u2192 probabilistic resonance, capturing distributional collapse in stochastic systems.</p> <p>Implications:</p> <p>- Proof assistants could use Equal$$ for provenance tracking.</p> <p>- ML interpretability could leverage Equal%% for distributional equivalence.</p> <p>- Distributed computing could adopt BEF as a new primitive for contextual truth.</p> <p>All of this is reproducible, open source, and documented in the Zero\u2011Ology repository.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">equal.txt</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Comparison of Brain Age Algorithms in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Advances in computational methods have accelerated the application of machine learning to analyze large complex biological data. By applying machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data, researchers have estimated the \"biological age of the brain\" i.e., brain age, and used it as a composite metric for indexing brain health, as opposed to using individual features of the brain extracted from neuroimaging data. These machine learning algorithms/models, often known as \"brain age\" algorithms/models, may take supervised or unsupervised approaches and may utilize one or many imaging modalities during training. We applied 3 regression-based algorithm and 1 neural network-based algorithm trained on varying sample sizes of healthy comparison (HC) participants to estimate the brain age of 73 HC and 44 individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) in our neuroimaging study. Out of the four, 3 were pre-trained off-the-shelf algorithms and 1 was developed and trained on multimodal neuroimaging data from a local cohort. The multimodal algorithm was trained on 51 age-matched HCs and tested on the remaining 22 HCs and 44 BDs. The brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD) score was calculated by subtracting the chronological age from the predicted age. Across four brain age prediction algorithms evaluated in HC, BrainageR and DenseNet demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (r = 0.83; 0.89) and lowest mean absolute errors (MAE = 5.94; 7.26). However, PHOTON (r = 0.65, MAE = 7.71) showed greatest sensitivity to BD as demonstrated by our logistic regression model where the PHOTON brain-PAD was a significant predictor (beta = 0.064, p < 0.05) of BD. Analyses using ICC revealed that agreement levels varied, with PHOTON achieving the highest ICC with DenseNet (0.78) and BrainageR (0.73), which suggests they may pick up similar brain features as opposed to the multimodal algorithm (0.17- 0.43) These results suggest that regularized linear models trained on large samples that explicitly exclude individuals with psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., PHOTON in this case) may be most sensitive to case-control differences despite having lower predictive accuracy. Our findings can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts for researchers working with datasets that are similarly constrained by sample size but include unique combinations of imaging modalities.",

      "content": "Mutation specific therapeutic approaches, like exon skipping or gene-editing, hold promise for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Translatability of preclinical studies investigating these approaches could greatly be improved through the use of humanized mouse models, as these allow preclinical testing of human specific sequences. We developed four novel humanized DMD mouse models with either a deletion of exon 44, 45, 51 or 53 in the human DMD gene, in a mouse dystrophin negative background (mdx mouse; exon 23 nonsense mutation). Our optimized prescreening pipeline allowed us to do so very efficiently with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We confirmed either complete lack of dystrophin, or expression of trace levels, which led to development of muscle pathology consisting of muscle fiber de-, and regeneration, inflammation and fibrosis in young adult mice. Intramuscular treatment with vivo-morpholinos targeting a flanking exon induced exon skipping in the DMD strains, which restored the disrupted open reading frame and subsequently dystrophin expression. This validates these models as valuable tools for preclinical studies investigating human sequence specific therapeutic approaches for DMD.",

      "title": "Cognitive Performance and Brain-Predicted Age Difference in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) is a promising marker of advanced brain aging, but its link to cognitive function in bipolar disorder (BD) is not well understood, especially when comparing across publicly available algorithms trained on diverse, large sample datasets and to algorithms trained on local cohorts with rich multimodal imaging data. Our study compares algorithms used to estimate brain-PAD in terms of their clinical relevance to cognition in BD. We included 44 euthymic BD I individuals and 73 HCs who completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and we selected nine scores from this battery for further analyses. Raw scores were log-transformed, scaled, and subjected to PCA; PC1 indexed overall executive function. Four brain-PAD algorithms (PHOTON, BrainageR, DenseNet, Multimodal) were applied to T1-weighted MRI data; the multimodal algorithm also included Diffussion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state Magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI) data. For each algorithm, we regressed brain-PAD on age, sex, and their interaction to obtain residuals, then used those residualized brain-PADs (which we refer to subsequently as brain-PADs throughout the text) to predict PC1. We then directly assessed if there were group differences in the relationship of brain-PAD to cognitive function by including an interaction term between group x brain-PAD. We found no significant group x brain-PAD interaction across all four algorithms. Given that, we then combined BD and HC and explored whether brain-PAD was a meaningful predictor of cognitive performance. Multimodal brain-PAD emerged as a strong negative predictor of cognitive performance (Beta Estimate = -0.084, SE = 0.024, t = -3.50, p < 0.001), indicating that those with older-appearing brains, as indexed by the brain-PAD, scored lower on PC1. BrainageR brain-PAD also significantly predicted PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.031, SE = 0.0116, t = -2.71, p < 0.01), and DenseNet brain-PAD showed a modest effect (Beta Estimate = -0.0355, SE = 0.0177, t = -2.00, p < 0.05). PHOTON brain-PAD demonstrated a negative trend with PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.0127, t = -1.92, p = 0.06). Residualized brain-PAD, after accounting for age and sex, was inversely associated with a composite metric of executive functioning, particularly for an algorithm integrating a range of imaging modalities. Our findings demonstrate how brain aging patterns captured by a neuroimaging-based, ML-derived composite metric could be associated with cognitive performance across algorithms trained on a variety of data granularity and sample sizes.",

      "title": "Deep White-Matter Pathways Mediate the Link Between Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Status and Cognitive Performance in Adolescence",
      "content": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched in neuronal membranes and myelin and associated with cognitive performance. However, nutritional interventions show inconsistent cognitive effects, partly due to limited knowledge of the neural pathways linking DHA status to human cognition during sensitive periods of white-matter maturation, such as adolescence. We addressed this gap by studying 99 adolescents drawn from both extremes of performance on a national scholastic examination. Participants completed assessments of scholastic achievement (SA) and intellectual ability (IA), provided erythrocyte DHA samples, and underwent multimodal MRI, including diffusion, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging. Independent component analysis and Bayesian multivariate LASSO models identified brain components jointly associated with DHA and cognition. Across four MRI modalities, a single deep white-matter component consistently emerged as the strongest shared pathway linking DHA with cognition. Tract-resolved analyses highlighted predominant contributions from the fornix and thalamus - temporal fasciculus, with additional subcortical and cortical involvement. In joint models, these components predicted SA and IA after accounting for DHA and other fatty acids, consistent with an indirect, mediation-like pathway. These findings move beyond DHA - behavior correlations by identifying specific neuroanatomical pathways through which a modifiable dietary factor relates to adolescent learning and intellectual performance, offering mechanistic insight relevant to neuroscience, nutrition, and education.",
