      "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation combined with exercise therapy for chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundChronic low-back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability, with current treatments offering only modest benefits. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance exercise therapy by modulating cortical excitability and pain-inhibitory pathways. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the additive effect of combining tDCS with structured exercise in adults with CLBP.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Embase, and CNKI up to 25 September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active tDCS plus identical exercise therapy vs. sham tDCS plus the same exercise in adults with CLBP (\u2265 12 weeks) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated for pain and function, respectively.GRADE was used to assess certainty.ResultsFive RCTs (n = 195) were included. For pain intensity (4 studies, n = 173), tDCS showed a significant additive effect (WMD = \u22120.99, 95% CI: \u22121.68 to \u22120.31, p = 0.006, I2 = 60.1%). For physical function (five studies, n = 195), the effect was favorable but non-significant (SMD = \u22120.65, 95% CI: \u22121.87 to 0.57, p = 0.28, I2 = 90.7%). Meta-regression indicated intervention duration significantly moderated functional outcomes (\u03b2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). GRADE certainty was moderate for pain and low for function.ConclusionAnodal tDCS combined with exercise provides a modest but significant additional reduction in pain intensity for CLBP. Longer intervention duration may enhance functional outcomes. Clinical significance should be interpreted cautiously. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation parameters.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251151315, identifier CRD420251151315.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I'm sharing this in the hope that at least one other person will find it useful.</p> <p>I've been trying to get Python libraries working in a browser using Pyodide, and indirect dependencies on native/compiled code are problematic. Specifically, I wanted to see the &quot;full&quot; dependency graph with info on which dependencies don't provide abi3 wheels, sdists, or are making subprocess/system calls.</p> <p>Since the existing dependency visualizers I found didn't show that info, I threw together this client-side webpage that can be used to check for potentially problematic indirect dependencies: <a href=\"https://surfactant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypi_dependency_analyzer.html\">https://surfactant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypi_dependency_analyzer.html</a></p> <p>The code for the page can be found on GitHub at: <a href=\"https://github.com/llnl/Surfactant/blob/main/docs/_static_html/pypi_dependency_analyzer.html\">https://github.com/llnl/Surfactant/blob/main/docs/_static_html/pypi_dependency_analyzer.html</a> (just the single html file)</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>It leverages the PyPI API to fetch metadata on all dependencies, and optionally fetch a copy of wheels that get unzipped (in memory) to scan for subprocess and system calls. Nothing fancy, but if anyone else has faced similar challenges perhaps they'll find this useful.</p> <p>Specifically, issues that come to mind this information can be helpful for identifying dependencies that:</p> <ul> <li>Have platform-specific wheels without an abi3 variant will require rebuilding for new CPython versions</li> <li>Have no sdist available, so will only be installable on OSes and CPU architectures that have had a platform-specific wheel published</li> <li>Make subprocess/system calls and implicitly depend on another program being installed on a user's system</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Developers looking to get a quick overview of what indirect dependencies might limit compatibility with running their tool on different systems.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Some existing websites can show a dependency graph for a Python project, but the main difference with this web app is that it highlights dependencies that don't provide a pure Python wheel, that could be problematic for maximizing compatibility with different platforms.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nightlark192\"> /u/Nightlark192 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe03a4/audit_python_packages_for_indirect/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe03a4/audit_python_packages_for_indirect/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "AimIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) combined with dual task training (DTT) on physical and cognitive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and stroke disorders.MethodWe conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for English-language literature on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of tDCS, tACS, or tRNS combined with DTT in adults with MCI, PD, and stroke. The search covered studies from the inception of each database up to November 21, 2025. The initial screening of selected articles was conducted independently by two researchers (YLQ and WLW).ResultsA total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising individuals with stroke (n\u202f=\u202f4), MCI (n\u202f=\u202f3), and PD (n\u202f=\u202f5). Meta-analysis revealed that active tDCS+DTT yielded no significant overall improvement in global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): SMD\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.66], p =\u202f0.77, I2 =\u202f72%). A large, highly homogeneous benefit was observed for executive function (TMT-B: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.33, 95% CI [\u22122.39, \u22120.27], p =\u202f0.01), driven exclusively by the MCI subgroup (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22122.35, 95% CI [\u22123.20, \u22121.51], I2 =\u202f0%). Timed Up and Go cognitive-motor dual-task (TUG CMDT) cadence improved overall (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CI [0.09, 1.08], p =\u202f0.02, I2 =\u202f39%) in both MCI and stroke subgroups. TUG motor dual task (MDT) speed improved modestly (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.02, 0.83], p =\u202f0.04, I2 =\u202f34%), and CMDT speed showed a strong trend (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, p =\u202f0.09), only significant in stroke (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.42, p =\u202f0.002). However, this generalized finding must be nuanced by specific efficacy observed in individual PD studies, which reported significant gains in force-tremor decoupling, postural stability, and CMDT accuracy.ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that the effects of tDCS combined with DTT are remarkable in certain populations and for specific outcomes. While substantial improvements are confirmed for executive function and dual-task gait in MCI and stroke, the overall limited efficacy in PD highlights the critical influence of heterogeneity and intervention specificity. Future research should prioritize disease-specific electrode montages and the integration of tACS or tRNS to optimize outcomes across diverse neurological populations.",

      "title": "Cerebral responses to famous face recognition as a potential functional biomarker of mild cognitive impairment",
      "content": "BackgroundSocial cognition impairments\u2014including difficulties in recognizing personally familiar faces\u2014occur early in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and can lead to social withdrawal, reduced motivation, and secondary depression. Face recognition is central to social cognition, yet its neural basis in MCI remains insufficiently understood. This study examined whether task-based fMRI during famous face recognition could capture early alterations in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), key nodes supporting semantic access and internally directed cognition within the default mode network (DMN).MethodsThirty-two participants (20 healthy controls, 12 MCI) completed two fMRI tasks: famous vs. non-famous face judgment and face vs. object categorization. A 2 \u00d7 2 factorial analysis assessed Group and Task effects, and small-volume correction was applied to PHG and PCC.ResultsBehavioral accuracy was comparable between groups; however, whole-brain analyses revealed markedly reduced activation in the left PHG and PCC in the MCI group during socially meaningful face processing. ROI analyses further demonstrated that the left PHG reduction remained significant after FWE correction, whereas PCC showed a weaker reduction that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.ConclusionThese findings suggest early alterations in PHG\u2013PCC networks that precede observable behavioral decline in MCI. In particular, reduced activation in the left PHG may reflect early disruptions in semantic access and internally directed processing. Assessing these socially relevant neural circuits alongside established amyloid and tau biomarkers may provide complementary functional insight into early cognitive vulnerability in individuals at risk for dementia.",
