      "content": "Modulating neural plasticity is pursued as a therapeutic approach for several neurologic conditions. Here we evaluated if enhancing experience-dependent plasticity prolongs vision in a murine model of retinitis pigmentosa. First, we quantified the loss of visual acuity under both scotopic and photopic conditions for mice heterozygous for the P23H mutation in the Rhodopsin gene (Rho P23H/+). Acuity progressively declined under scotopic conditions followed by photopic conditions. Acuity deficits only broadly correlated with the retinal response measured by the electroretinogram. In contrast, acuity deficits were consistent with the percent of cortical excitatory layer 2/3 neurons responsive to higher spatial frequency visual stimuli. Then, we tested if enhancing plasticity in adult visual circuity by deleting the nogo-66 receptor gene (Ngr1) would preserve vision in Rho P23H/+ mice. However, loss of vision was accelerated in Ngr1 -/-; Rho P23H/+ mice. Thus, enhancing plasticity can be maladaptive in the context of neural degeneration.",

      "title": "Enduring Autism-like Phenotypes and Deregulated Hypothalamic Prosocial Peptides After Early-Life Exposure to Indoor Flame Retardants in Male C57BL/6 Mice",
      "content": "Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are neuroendocrine disrupting chemicals that produce adverse neurodevelopmental effects. PBDEs have been implicated as risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning and is commonly accompanied by co-morbidities such as cognitive and attentional deficits. Here, we used a mouse model with translationally relevant exposure to establish direct causal evidence that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in male offspring. Methods: C57Bl6/N mouse dams were exposed to a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, via oral administration of 0 (vehicle control, VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71), or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d for 10 weeks, spanning three weeks prior to gestation through the end of lactation at postnatal day (PND) 21. Results: Mass spectrometric analysis indicated dose-dependent transfer of PBDEs (in ppb) to brains of F1 male offspring at PND 30, with reduction in levels by PND 110. Adult F1 male offspring displayed ASD-relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes, including impaired short- and long-term social recognition memory (SRM), despite intact general sociability, and exaggerated repetitive behavior. Exposed mice also displayed altered olfactory discrimination of social odors, impaired novel object recognition memory, and reduced open field habituation. However, no changes were observed in anxiety-like, sensorimotor, or depressive-like behaviors relative to VEH/CON. At the molecular level, DE-71 exposed males displayed deregulated gene markers of prosocial neuropeptides. Oxt was upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN); Avp was upregulated in the PVN and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) but downregulated in the lateral septum (LS); Avp1ar and Adcyap1 were upregulated in the BNST; and Adcyap1r1 was upregulated in the PVN, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and BNST. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that developmental PBDE exposure produces enduring behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes that resemble core domains of ASD, which may result from early neurodevelopmental reprogramming within central social and memory networks.",

      "title": "Neuroinflammation links the neurogenic and neurodegenerative phenotypes of Nrmt1-/- mice",
      "content": "It is widely thought that age-related damage is the single biggest contributing factor to neurodegenerative diseases. However, recent studies are beginning to indicate that many of these diseases may have developmental origins that become unmasked overtime. It has been difficult to prove these developmental origins, as there are still few known links between defective embryonic neurogenesis and progressive neurodegeneration. We have created a constitutive knockout mouse for the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 (Nrmt1-/- mice). Nrmt1-/- mice display phenotypes associated with premature aging. Specifically in the brain, they exhibit age-related striatal and hippocampal degeneration, which is accompanied by impaired short and long-term memory. These phenotypes are preceded by depletion of the postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) pools, which appears to be driven by their premature differentiation and migration. However, this differentiation is often incomplete, as many resulting neurons cannot permanently exit the cell cycle and ultimately undergo apoptosis. Here, we show that the onset of apoptosis corresponds to increased cleavage of p35 into the CDK5 activator p25, which can promote neuroinflammation. Accordingly, Nrmt1-/- brains exhibit an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, astrogliosis, complement activation, microgliosis, and markers of a compromised blood brain barrier, all of which indicate an activated neuroimmune response. We also find Nrmt1-/- mice do not activate a corresponding anti-inflammatory response. These data indicate that abnormal neurogenesis can trigger neuroinflammation, which in the absence of compensatory anti-inflammatory signaling, could lead to neuronal apoptosis and progressive neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Ischemic stroke increases levels of the folate receptor and one-carbon enzymes in male and female brain tissue",
      "content": "Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and predominantly affects individuals over 65 years old. Its prevalence is projected to increase in parallel with the aging global population. Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Folates, B-vitamins and choline play a central role in one-carbon metabolism (1C), which is a key metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, epigenetics, regulation of cell proliferation, and stress resistance. Our research group has previously shown that deficiencies in 1C lead to worsened stroke outcomes using preclinical models. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on 1C enzymes in affected brain tissue remains unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate whether ischemic stroke contributes to a change in the levels of 1C enzymes after ischemic stroke in male and female patients. Cortical brain tissue sections from ischemic stroke patients and controls were stained for enzymes involved in 1C. All tissue was co-stained with neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The colocalization of all three markers was evaluated by two individuals who were blinded to the experimental groups. Ischemic stroke increased neuronal levels of the folate receptor and 1C enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS) and serine hydroxy methyltransferase (SHMT). In male stroke brain tissue was observed to have increased levels of MTHFR, TS, and SHMT. Female brain tissue had increases in the folate receptor and TS. The results suggest that ischemic stroke leads to increased demand of 1C and that there are some differences between males and females.",
