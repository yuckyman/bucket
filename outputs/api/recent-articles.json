      "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

      "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Psilocybin modulates social behaviour in male and female mice in a time-dependent manner",
      "content": "With the resurgence of psychedelic research and the growing interest in their therapeutic potential, there is an urgent need to understand how these compounds act across biological sexes. Despite widespread interest in their use for conditions marked by social impairments, including depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa, the influence of sex as a biological variable (SABV) on the prosocial effects of psychedelics remains poorly understood. Indeed, enhanced connectedness, sociability and empathy are common outcomes of psychedelic use and these have shaped human social structures for millennia. Here, we investigated the sex-specific effects of a single dose of psilocybin (1.5 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice on various aspects of social behaviours. We show an intriguing connection between huddling behaviour and body temperature acutely elicited by psilocybin that was restricted to females. We also observe temporally distinct patterns of social behaviour alterations in female mice, whereby enhanced preference for social novelty was observed after acute effects subsided (4 h post-administration), which was maintained for ~24 h. Longer-term, the impact of psilocybin was reversed and promoted preference for familiar over novel conspecifics when assessed 7d post-administration, which was associated with prolonged nucleus accumbens dopamine signalling during familiar sniffing. In males, psilocybin reduced stress-related behaviours at 24 h and increased preference for familiar conspecifics, along with blunted novelty-evoked dopamine responses at both 24 h and 7 days post-treatment. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were involved in modulating these behaviours, though in sex-specific ways. These findings highlight that the prosocial effects of psychedelics are not universal and emphasize the importance of sex-informed approaches in both preclinical research and clinical application.",

      "title": "ADGRG1 blockade drives astrocyte positioning into the extracellular matrix to reduce scar size",
      "content": "After the central nervous system (CNS) injury, inflammatory cells enter the lesion core and a fibrotic extracellular matrix accumulates. Astrocytes subsequently cluster around this matrix, forming a glial scar, but the role of the extracellular matrix in scar formation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify type III collagen, a major fibrotic extracellular matrix component after spinal cord injury, as a key regulator of astrocyte behavior. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and time-lapse cell imaging, we show that type III collagen positions astrocytes at the boundary of the fibrotic matrix by activating the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1 (ADGRG1) and its downstream effector RhoA. Blocking ADGRG1 genetically or pharmacologically allows astrocytes to enter the fibrotic matrix, resulting in a smaller scar, improved neuronal regeneration, and better motor recovery. The migration of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes was inhibited by type III collagen via the ADGRG1-RhoA pathway, supporting their therapeutic potential. Our findings reveal the importance of controlling glial scar positioning via the type III collagen-ADGRG1 axis, providing a novel therapeutic target for CNS injury.",

      "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
      "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

      "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
      "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients.

      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",
