      "title": "Stable fusion of bone marrow-derived cells with Purkinje neurons enables long-term nuclear integration and neuronal repair",
      "content": "Developing effective strategies to replace or restore injured neurons could significantly revolutionise the treatment of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can migrate into the brain and fuse with damaged Purkinje neurons (PNs), restoring their structure and function. Yet, despite over two decades of research, the temporal dynamics and functional stability of these fusion events in vivo remain poorly defined, largely due to reliance on static, post-mortem histological analyses that provide only a single snapshot in time. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus. Given their accessibility and genetic tractability, BMDCs represent a practical and promising platform for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to PNs, opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative disease.",

      "title": "Distinct neural processing of real versus unreal optic flow in the human brain",
      "content": "Visual perception of self-movement relies on optic flow, a global motion pattern generated by self-movement in a rigid 3D environment. Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as \"real\" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such \"unreal\" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.",

      "content": "Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has become a powerful tool for 3D ultrastructural analysis of neural circuits, yet its application to human brain organoids remains limited, particularly for connectomic studies. Here, we established a comprehensive and scalable workflow for applying vEM to human cortical organoids, integrating correlative light and electron microscopy, large-area SEM mosaic imaging, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validation. By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.",

      "content": "Cell-type-speci[fi]c expression of synthetic/endogenous proteins or genetic sequences has signi[fi]cantly advanced our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery to cerebrospinal [fl]uid (CSF) mediates transfection of target cells to enable sustained delivery of secretory proteins into the CSF, o[ff]ering promising avenues for both CNS therapy and mechanistic studies. However, despite the advantages afforded by AAV tropism-based cellular selectivity and transgene delivery, both preclinical studies and clinical trials report short- and long-term adverse e[ff]ects, particularly immune activation. Especially relevant for CSF biology, CNS immune insults raise the risk of CSF dysregulation, including hydrocephalus. These risks may be exacerbated in pediatric populations, where ongoing CNS development, including immature meninges, choroid plexus (ChP), and skull structures, may further impair any ability to compensate for CSF dysregulation. To systematically address these risks and provide guidelines for minimizing CNS immune insults by AAVs, we test the dose-dependent e[ff]ects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 3 AAV serotypes (AAV2/5, AAV2/4, and AAV.PHP.eB) to neonatal (P0.5) CD1 mouse pups. Histological analysis veri[fi]ed AAV2/5 tropism limited to ChP epithelial cells (CPECs), whereas AAV.PHP.eB transfected both CPECs and ependymal regions. By contrast, AAV2/4 shows limited transfection in the brain. Further, we [fi]nd that ICV injections of all 3 AAV serotypes at the high dose (4x109 genome copy GC/pup) induced ventriculomegaly by P7.5, while the low dose (1x109 GC/pup) was well tolerated. Additionally, high-dose AAV2/5 tropism became more permissive, transfecting the ChP and also ependymal cells and some neurons. Longitudinal MRI of P0.5 pups with high-dose AAV2/5 ICV injections highlighted quick progression of ventriculomegaly. CSF ELISA analysis detected elevated proin[fl]ammatory cytokine CCL2 in AAV2/5 and AAV2/4 high-dose groups, indicating CNS inflammation. Moreover, decreased CSF TTR concentrations in high-dose groups suggest ChP dysfunction. We further revealed that earlier in utero high-dose ICV AAV2/5 injections at E13.5 induced even more severe ventriculomegaly and that adult animals were also susceptible to ventriculomegaly after high-dose AAV ICV delivery. Taken together, our data emphasize critical safety considerations of CSF-based AAV delivery, particularly during brain development. Further, these results call for an optimized dosage for perinatal ICV AAV applications.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
