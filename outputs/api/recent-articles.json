      "title": "Connectome Similarity Varies with Global Metastability and Movie Content",
      "content": "Introduction: Recent evidence supports that non-linear segments of brain activity carries most of the individual-specific information which allows unique identification based on functional connectomes (e.g. connectome fingerprints) in MEG. In fMRI, metastability has emerged as a reliable and robust summary measure of brain dynamics. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that metastability is associated with connectome fingerprinting in naturalistic fMRI. We further examined whether this putative association varies with time scales, across brain functional networks, and depending on the movie content. Methods: We analyzed fMRI data from 86 participants of the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database. Data was collected during movie-watching of 10 entire movies of different genres. Global and network-level metastability were calculated using an fMRI-appropriate proxy measure based on the variability of spatial coherence. The within-subject stability (Iself) and between-subjects similarity (Iothers) of individual functional connectomes were also calculated. Linear mixed-effects models and appropriate contrasts were used to test associations between metastability and fingerprinting indices. Results: At the whole-brain level and considering data from all movies, an association across windows was found between metastability, Iself, and Iothers, with stronger effects observed for larger windows, such as the 600-second window (Iself: b = -0.13, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.23, SE = 0.028, p < 0.001). Associations were also observed with distinct magnitudes within the eight large-scale functional networks, with particularly strong effects in the Motor Network (Iself: b = -0.34, SE = 0.027, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.27, SE = 0.021, p < 0.001). Although no whole-brain differences were observed, movie content exhibited distinct association patterns within networks, notably for the prediction of Iself in the Visual Network for 500 Days of Summer ({Delta} = -0.22, SE = 0.11, p = 0.043). For Iothers, significant between-movie differences were found in the AMN ({Delta} = -0.25, SE = 0.062, p < 0.001), Dorsal Attention ({Delta} = 0.16, SE = 0.08, p = 0.038), Ventral Attention ({Delta} = 0.14, SE = 0.060, p = 0.017), and Visual Networks ({Delta} = -0.17, SE = 0.081, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Metastability is systematically related to functional connectome fingerprints. This relationship is time-scale dependent, varies across functional networks, and is sensitive to movie content. Our findings bridge nonlinear brain dynamics and connectome identifiability, highlighting naturalistic paradigms as a powerful framework for individualized precision neuroimaging.",

      "title": "Gasdermin E couples mitochondrial damage to pyroptotic neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease",
      "content": "Parkinson disease (PD) features progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, but how mitochondrial damage engages programmed cell death pathways remains unresolved. Here, we identify gasdermin E (GSDME), the caspase-3-activated executor of pyroptosis, as a critical mediator of neurodegeneration in toxin-based PD models. In primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP triggered caspase-3 activation, GSDME cleavage, and lytic membrane rupture. Genetic silencing of Gsdme or its transcriptional regulator SP1 reduced neuronal death. In vivo, Gsdme deficiency preserved substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, improved motor performance, and mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after MPTP administration. Loss of Gsdme also dampened microglial and astrocytic activation and lowered proinflammatory cytokines in striatum and substantia nigra. Mechanistically, cleaved GSDME localized to mitochondria, disrupted membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, and precipitated organelle injury, thereby coupling mitochondrial dysfunction to pyroptotic cell death. These findings identify GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a mechanistic link between mitochondrial toxicity and neuroinflammation in PD and nominate GSDME as a therapeutic entry point to slow disease progression.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

Despite its potential, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of this technique remain unclear.ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of multifocal tES in enhancing cognitive function by examining targeted brain regions, stimulation protocols, and behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted up to February 10, 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The inclusion criteria encompassed human studies utilizing concurrent dual-site or multifocal tES with pre- and post-intervention behavioral assessments. Studies on deep brain stimulation, corticocortical paired associative stimulation, sequential stimulation, case reports, and reviews were excluded.ResultsOf the 1,453 initial records, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The studies predominantly employed transcranial direct current stimulation/transcranial alternating current stimulation, targeting the frontoparietal network. Neurophysiological data from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed network-level modulations. Behavioral outcomes were inconsistent, with some studies reporting improvements in executive function, working memory, and response inhibition, whereas others showed no significant advantages over sham stimulation.ConclusionAlthough multifocal tES is a promising modality, clearly determining its efficacy is currently limited by heterogeneous study designs, small sample sizes, and conflicting findings. Future research should prioritize multi-arm trials, incorporate neurophysiological biomarkers, and develop personalized stimulation protocols to optimize the effectiveness of this technique.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration # CRD420250646196.",

      "title": "Perceptual learning improves spatial contrast sensitivity in older adults",
      "content": "IntroductionWidespread visual deficits accompany normal aging, with most attributed to functional degradation of the visual cortex. Although perceptual learning can improve many visual functions in older adults, it remains unclear whether it can enhance spatial contrast sensitivity, a fundamental visual function known to decline significantly from around age forty.MethodsTo address this, we trained 29 older adults and 18 young controls using contrast perceptual learning. Training was conducted at seven spatial frequencies (from low to high) and/or at the individual cut-off spatial frequency. Spatial contrast sensitivity function (SCSF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured before and after training.ResultsTraining induced substantial improvements in both SCSF and VA in older adults, which were retained for at least several months. Analysis of transfer effects revealed that, compared to young controls, older adults exhibited a characteristic low-frequency shift in peak improvement and a slightly broader bandwidth.DiscussionThese results may be associated with age-related alterations in neuronal response properties within the primary visual cortex. Our findings demonstrate substantial neural plasticity in the aging visual system and support the potential of perceptual learning as a clinically viable intervention for mitigating age-related visual decline.",

      "title": "Contribution of binocular visual function and its impairment by Bangerter foils to the performance of a precision reaching, grasping and placing task in healthy adults",
      "content": "BackgroundUpper limb movement execution is affected in patients with vision impairments resulting from ocular pathologies or binocular anomalies. Deficits in motor performance have been correlated with reduced contrast sensitivity, phoria, and stereoacuity.AimTo evaluate the effects of increased straylight induced by Bangerter foils on binocular visual function and examine the corresponding impact on eye-hand kinematics during a high precision reaching, grasping and placement task (i.e., bead threading).MethodsTwenty-one healthy participants, aged 21\u201341\u202fyears, participated in this experimental study. Visual function assessment included visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), stereoacuity (SA), phoria, and fusional vergences (FV). Vision was impaired experimentally using Bangerter foils 0.4. Participants performed a bead threading task under three randomized viewing conditions: binocular baseline (BB; normal vision), binocular viewing with a foil over the dominant eye (FDE), and foils over both eyes (FBE). Eye and hand movements were recorded using an eye tracker and a motion capture camera.ResultsVisual functions (VA, CS, and stereoacuity) were impaired when viewing with the Bangerter foils. Pairwise comparison between viewing conditions confirmed statistically significant differences between BB, FDE and FBE for mid to high spatial frequencies (6, 12 and 18\u202fcycles per degree; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Break points for positive and negative fusional reserves were impaired when interocular differences increased (i.e., FDE condition). The impairment did not have any impact on phoria. Results from the kinematic analysis revealed threading duration was prolonged using Bangerter foils on both eyes (FBE condition). In contrast to the hypothesis, visual deficit due to foils did not affect any other kinematic measures. However, results from mixed model analyses revealed that individual differences in phoria and fusional vergence had the most significant influence on reaching performance. Specifically, a larger exophoria magnitude was associated with longer reach duration, lower peak velocity and prolonged total time to complete the task (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionInducing short-term deterioration through the alteration of contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies without a clinical deterioration in stereopsis does not have a significant impact on precision grasping and placing movements, in a repetitive manual task. Notably, this study demonstrated that phoria impacts the execution of reaching movements.",

      "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
      "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

      "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant mental and physical burden on patients, markedly diminishing their quality of life. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive functions, mood state, sleep function, and overal quality of life in individuals with PD.MethodsRelevant literature was sourced from multiple databases, ultimately including 22 studies with a total of 1324 individuals. Data analysis was conducted using meta-analysis software. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024599943).ResultsThe findings indicated that tDCS significantly enhanced cognitive function, alleviated anxiety and depression, increased sleep duration, improved sleep efficiency, reduced arousal index, and ameliorated daytime sleepiness, while also enhancing activities of daily living. However, discrepancies were noted across various assessment scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Cognitive Rating Scale, delayed recall metrics, sleep scales, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire. Additionally, individuals with PD displayed good tolerance to tDCS.ConclusionOverall, tDCS shows promise in improving non-motor symptoms and enhancing quality of life for individuals with PD. Nonetheless, large-scale trials are necessary to confirm these results further.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024599943, Identifier: CRD42024599943.",

      "title": "Regional abnormalities in the hippocampus and verbal memory impairment in craniofacial dystonia",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with craniofacial dystonia (CFD) often present with verbal memory deficits, but their neuroanatomical basis is not yet clear. This study aims to determine whether verbal memory deficits in CFD are associated with structural atrophy of specific hippocampal subfields, and to isolate dystonia-specific pathological changes through comparison with patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS).MethodsWe recruited 50 patients with CFD, 48 patients with HFS, and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Verbal memory and global cognitive function were assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Volumes of hippocampal subfields were quantified from high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using FreeSurfer. Group comparisons were performed after controlling for relevant covariates.ResultsWhile global cognition (MMSE) scores did not differ significantly among groups, patients with CFD demonstrated significant verbal memory deficits. Compared with HCs, they performed worse across immediate, short-, and long-delay recall trials, with medium-to-large effect sizes (all P-FDR \u2264 0.002; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.70 to \u22120.82). Similar deficits of medium effect sizes were observed when compared with patients with HFS (all P-FDR \u2264 0.027; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.49 to \u22120.52). Crucially, patients with HFS were unimpaired relative to HCs, establishing this memory deficit as specific to the dystonia pathophysiology. The imaging analysis revealed that patients with CFD were associated with significant atrophy in the left granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) (P-FDR = 0.014; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.58) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.010; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.60) compared with HCs, and with significant atrophy in the right GC-DG (P-FDR = 0.032; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.52) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.041; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.50) compared with HCs. However, the magnitude of the atrophy showed no significant correlation with verbal memory scores, disease duration, or motor severity, revealing a critical structure-function dissociation.ConclusionOur findings reveal a structure-function dissociation in CFD. We propose its verbal memory deficits, despite hippocampal atrophy, may stem from broader network dysfunction or microstructural pathology not seen on conventional MRI. This challenges models assuming a direct link between macrostructural atrophy and cognitive symptoms.",

      "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",
