      "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
      "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
      "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
      "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Associations Between Frailty and Cognitive Outcomes Across the Lifespan of Mice",
      "content": "Advancements in monitoring biological and brain aging with precise measures of health and longevity have the potential to accelerate research on pharmacological, genetic, and aging-related interventions. Over the past decade, frailty index has been used as an assessment tool for rodents, evaluating more than 30 non-invasive parameters that are strongly associated with chronological age, correlated with mortality, and sensitive to lifespan-altering interventions. However, whether aging phenotypes captured by the frailty index reflect brain aging remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between frailty index and cognitive ability in young (3-4 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (24 months) male and female C57BL/6J mice using a battery of behavioral and locomotor assays to determine whether frailty index scores can predict performance in tasks evaluating behavioral and cognitive function. Among the behavioral assays tested, frailty index scores had good correlation with the percentage of time spent in the center of the open-field apparatus, the duration spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and the time spent in the target hole of the Barnes maze. These findings indicate that the frailty index not only reflects general physiological aging but may also serve as a reliable predictor of age-related cognitive decline in mice, providing a valuable tool for studies of interventions targeting brain aging.",

      "title": "Individual cortical neurons innervating large proportions of the neocortical areas in the MouseLight database",
      "content": "The general notion of the extent of cortical areal interconnectivity in the neuroscience community can in part be due to results from traditional neuroanatomical studies, which later insights have shown to systematically represent underestimates of the extent of the axonal arborizations. But any underestimate of this interconnectivity could in turn be a factor in strengthening the notion of functional localization in the cortex, i.e. the idea that there are circumscribed cortical areas with specific functions that do not to a large extent depend on information being processed in other such cortical areas. Recent advances in neuroanatomical techniques have greatly improved the possibilities to follow the axonal projections of individual neurons in full, and many reconstructed neurons are made available by the MouseLight database. We sampled individual cortical neurons with the majority of their axons within the neocortex and explored the extent of their axonal connections. We found that the efferent axon of individual cortical neurons can commonly cover as much as 30-40% of all types of cortical areas, with a coverage of up to 80% for a single neuron also being demonstrated. Combining the distributions of the axonal trees of more than one cortical neuron, we found that as few as three neurons within one area could reach 100% of the other cortical areas.",

      "title": "Multimodal Connectivity-based Cortical Segmentation with Graph Neural Networks",
      "content": "Due to the significant amount of time and expertise needed for manual segmentation of the brain cortex from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, there is a substantial need for efficient and accurate algorithms to replace the need for human involvement. In this work, we explore the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to segment the brain surface based on structural brain connectivity. We train three different GNN architectures, the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), the Graph Attention Network (GAT), and the Graph U-Net, and evaluate their performances when trained on silver-standard cortical region labels created by FreeSurfer. We take a multimodal approach to brain segmentation by examining the influence of the structural connectivity values inferred from diffusion MRI (dMRI) in addition to using values from structural MRI (sMRI). Our results demonstrate the utility of GNN models, particularly the GAT architecture, which achieved Dice scores competitive to those reported in the literature with non-graph methods. Additionally, structural connectivity derived from dMRI revealed significant value in improving automatic segmentation, as models trained on combined attributes from dMRI and sMRI outperformed those trained only on sMRI. Finally, we compared the GNN-based and the FreeSurfer segmentations in their ability to predict demographic characteristics, where neither of the two approaches was statistically significantly superior to the other.",

      "title": "Auditory network persistence of stimulus representation in awake and naturally sleeping mice",
      "content": "Persistent neural activity often outlasts sensory stimulation, bridging perception and action. While commonly linked to working memory and decision making, its existence during passive states and sleep remains unclear. Using chronic high-density electrophysiology in freely behaving mice, we show that population spiking activity across the auditory cortical hierarchy enables decoding of past stimuli long after their offset, during both wakefulness and sleep. Time-resolved decoding revealed that in wakefulness, persistent representations decay uniformly across sensory and association cortices, whereas during sleep, persistence is prolonged in association cortex but remains brief in early auditory regions. Recurrent neural network modeling showed that higher internal noise during wakefulness reproduces this pattern, suggesting that reduced interference during sleep stabilizes sensory traces in associative areas. Our results demonstrate that persistent representation is a passive, state-dependent feature of sensory processing, supporting sensory maintenance even in the absence of active engagement.",
