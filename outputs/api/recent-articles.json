      "content": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to perform multiple tasks immediately upon instruction. Yet, the neural processes that implement such flexibility remain unclear. Using intracranial electrophysiology in epilepsy patients, we examined how representational geometries evolve as participants switched among three tasks - individuation, categorization, and conceptualization - on a trial-by-trial basis. Although tasks differed in the required representational geometries, neural representations across cortex were not immediately optimized following task cues. Instead, task-tailored geometries emerged gradually over successive stimulus repetitions within a trial. Ventral temporal cortex was the only region to exhibit task-specific adjustments for all three tasks, dynamically transforming within- and between-category distances in line with task demands. Importantly, these gradual representational changes were behaviorally relevant, predicting trial-level performance. Our results show that behavioral flexibility is supported by incremental, task-dependent refinement of representational geometry already within sensory cortex - far earlier in the processing hierarchy than previously thought.",

      "title": "Sex-specific brain structural predictors and outcomes of adolescent depression trajectories",
      "content": "Objectives: Depressive symptoms often emerge and increase during adolescence, yet the neural predictors and long-term brain outcomes associated with depressive trajectories remain poorly understood. This study adopts a trajectory-based approach to explore the temporal relationship between brain structure and dynamic changes in depressive symptoms across adolescence. Methods: We used a large longitudinal adolescent neuroimaging sample across five annual waves (n = 11,862; mean age = 9.91 at baseline) from the ABCD study. First, growth mixture models were applied separately for males and females to identify distinct developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms. We then used linear mixed-effects models to identify which baseline brain structural features differentiated trajectory classes, and how these trajectories influenced subsequent brain structure. Results: We identified high-decreasing, stable-low, and low-increasing trajectories in females, and relatively stable high, moderate, and low trajectories in males. No baseline brain regions were found to be associated with female trajectories, whereas smaller global brain measures (total subcortical volume, cortical volume, and surface area) predicted the high trajectory in males. Regarding brain outcomes, a low-increasing trajectory in females was associated with smaller global subcortical and cortical volumes, while high and moderate trajectories in males predicted thinner global cortices. Additional trajectory-related regional brain alterations were observed in both sexes. Conclusions: These findings highlight distinct neurodevelopmental patterns linked to depressive symptom trajectories in males and females, underscoring the importance of a sex-specific and longitudinal approach to identifying neural risk and outcomes in adolescent depression.",

      "title": "Arsenic Trioxide Underpins Delayed Neuroinflammation and Impaired Synaptic Integrity involving Integrative Stress Response Signaling",
      "content": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an industrial and environmental chemical with potential for accidental or intentional exposure, exerts profound neurotoxic effects. Its single acute exposure has been linked to delayed neurological and neurodegenerative outcomes. However, the molecular and cellular pathways driving these long-term manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, combining human iPSC-derived neuronal and in vivo mouse model, we uncovered that the acute ATO exposure activates cellular stress pathway, which drives long-term neurotoxic and associated functional outcomes. We found that ATO induces integrated stress response (ISR) signaling in human iPSC-derived neurons. To model the impact of accidental ATO exposure in vivo, we administered a single high dose of ATO to C57BL/6J wild type mice. Four weeks post-treatment, ATO-exposed mice displayed neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive deficits. Brain analyses of ATO-challenged mice revealed elevated ISR activity marked by the increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2 and upregulation of the transcription factors, CHOP and ATF4. Transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNAseq revealed activation of pathways associated with stress and neuroinflammatory responses. Consistently, increased DNA damage and dysregulation of the STING-mediated innate immune response were also found in the brain of ATO-challenged mice. Pharmacological inhibition of the ISR with a small-molecule inhibitor, ISRIB mitigated ISR activation and preserved synaptic integrity in mouse hippocampal cells. In conclusion, our data identify ISR activation and DNA damage-driven immune dysregulation as key pathogenic drivers of ATO-induced delayed neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and highlight ISR inhibitors as promising therapeutics to mitigate these effects.",

      "title": "Cellular coding of ingestion in the caudal brainstem",
      "content": "The passage of food through the alimentary canal generates a series of feedback signals that are sensed by the brain and used to control behavior. Many of these signals converge on the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), a brainstem structure that is the direct target of the vagal sensory neurons that innervate the throat, stomach and intestines and detect ingested food. These vagal neurons are thought to transmit key gut-brain signals that trigger meal termination, but how this information is represented in the cNTS, and used to control behavior, is largely unknown. Here, we have used a preparation for single-cell imaging in the cNTS of behaving animals to characterize how food ingestion is encoded in the caudal brainstem. We find that when food is delivered directly to the stomach, thereby bypassing the oral cavity, cNTS neurons exhibit ramping activation that occurs over many minutes and depends on canonical gut-brain pathways. However, when the same food is consumed by mouth, most cNTS neurons exhibit phasic, seconds-timescale responses that are time-locked to oral contact of food or cues that predict food delivery. We show that this rapid feedback is due to a combination of mechanical, gustatory and nutritive signals signals from the mouth and throat and does not require canonical gut-brain pathways, including gut-innervating vagal afferents, although GI feedback modulates the duration of these pregastric responses. We show that one source of this rapid input is descending projections from the paraventricular hypothalamus, which track ingestion dynamics and are required for proper meal termination. These findings reveal that the caudal brainstem makes extensive use of pregastric signals that track the dynamics of ingestion for the rapid control of food consumption.",

      "title": "An orthogonal TRAP enables intersectional genetic access to activated neurons in the mouse brain",
      "content": "The study of neural circuits has been greatly enabled by methods for obtaining genetic access to activated neurons. However, these approaches typically tag neurons based on their response to only a single stimulus, which limits the ability to define precise subpopulations of cells. Here we describe an approach (X-TRAP) in which the activity-dependent expression of Flp recombinase is gated by branaplam, a small molecule that triggers splicing of the X-ON switch. We show that X-TRAP knock-in mice exhibit undetectable Flp recombination in the absence of drug and that branaplam treatment results in robust induction of recombination selectively in neurons that express FOS. Moreover, we show that X-TRAP is orthogonal to the widely-used TRAP system, such that these two approaches can be used in the same animal to label cells with Cre and Flp recombination in response to two different stimuli. We apply this strategy to map neural circuits that control food intake. This approach for intersectional, activity-dependent genetic labeling should enhance our ability to identify the neural correlates of behavior.",

      "title": "Calbindin-containing CA1 pyramidal cells support cognitive flexibility in spatial task in mice",
      "content": "The hippocampus, and particularly the dorsal CA1, is essential for spatial memory consolidation through sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) that enable the transfer of information to cortical areas. Within the dorsal CA1, distinct pyramidal cell subpopulations of the deep and superficial layer may play distinct roles in the processing and updating of spatial information. Using a Cre-dependent mouseline, we were able to precisely target the superficial, Calbindin (CALB1+) PCs of the CA1. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the connectivity of CALB1+ CA1 PCs to their SWR-propagating excitatory output partners within the Subiculum (SUB), the burst-firing SUB PCs and their functional relevance in spatial memory consolidation and recall. Retrograde rabies tracing revealed heterogeneous innervation of the VGlut2+ bursting PCs by both CA1 PC sublayers, and showed that the majority of presynaptic inputs are located in the superficial CA1 PC layer. We were able to observe that this anatomically confirmed connection between CALB1+ CA1 PCs and both SUB PC subtypes is able to induce spiking more reliably in burst- than regular-firing SUB PCs. CNO-induced inhibition in a Barnes Maze task revealed that the experimental group showed reduced cognitive flexibility and were slower to adapt to re-location of the goal when CALB1+ CA1 PCs were inhibited during the recall (test), while both groups behaved similarly when consolidation was manipulated (training). Inhibition did not impact overall learning, strategy development or locomotor control. This suggests that CALB1+ CA1 PCs preferentially connect to bursting SUB PCs, and support cognitive flexibility needed to adapt to a changing environment, adding further proof to the functional relevance of laminar segregation of the CA1 and the hippocampus in spatial memory processes.",

      "title": "D1R- and D4R-Dependent Regulation of Retinal Light Adaptation in Diabetes",
      "content": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered a neurovascular disease, and key clinical features show impairments in visual acuity and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Dopamine, a critical regulator of light adaptation, is also reduced in diabetes and supplementation of dopamine or injection of dopamine agonists improve visual deficits in diabetic rodents and humans. We sought to examine how blocking D4Rs and D1Rs would affect ERG signaling in 6-week diabetic rodents. Blocking D4Rs with L745,870 significantly reduced dark-adapted A-wave amplitude in DM, but not non-DM retinas, with no change in a-wave implicit timing, suggesting diabetic alterations in D4R signaling in photoreceptors. Light-adapted (LA) recordings revealed blocking D4Rs significantly increased A-wave amplitude and delayed A-wave implicit timing in DM and non-DM retinas. B-wave amplitudes were elevated at the highest flash intensity, and rise time was significantly faster, indicating an inability to adjust to background light. D1R blockade with SCH-23390 had little effect on ERG recordings for both groups, aside from increased B-wave amplitude and delayed rise time in dark-adapted DM conditions towards the lower light intensities. While small, D4R blockade seems to have a bigger effect in DM conditions during light adaptation, suggesting that diabetes impairs the retinas ability to adjust to light adaptation. These studies show that dopamine signaling in diabetes is perturbed and an important avenue for future investigation.",

      "title": "Dopamine D1 Receptors Modulate glycinergic Inhibitory Inputs to OFF cone bipolar cells elicited by Optogenetic Activation of Amacrine Cells",
      "content": "Light evoked inhibition on OFF cone bipolar cells has been shown to be modulated by both background light levels and the Dopamine D1 Receptor. Since dopamine receptors are localized throughout the mouse retina, it is not known where in the light signaling cascade dopamine is modulating signals to OFF bipolar cells. The goal of this work was to develop a technique that allowed for the isolation of the amacrine to OFF bipolar cell circuit and determine if there are local changes in inhibition elicited by presynaptic amacrine cells onto OFF bipolar cells. To do this, we utilized the B6.Cg-Tg(Slc32al-COP4*H134R/EYFP) mouse line. These mice contain ChR2 in all the inhibitory cells in the retina. By optogenetically activating the amacrine cells, we were able to elicit inhibitory currents on bipolar cells independent of photoreceptor activation. Additionally, we were able to pharmacologically block inputs from photoreceptors while simultaneously isolating individual GABAergic and glycinergic inputs to OFF bipolar cells. While these optogenetically elicited currents were distinct from previously recorded light evoked currents, we found this as an effect way to measure changes in SKF38393 mediated reductions in glycinergic currents on OFF bipolar cells. However, we did not observe changes in GABAergic inhibition as we have previously seen in light evoked currents. Together, this gives a novel perspective on how dopamine differentially shapes inhibitory changes in the inner retina.",

      "content": "Letter recognition is assumed to involve several levels of analysis, including coarse tuning for category and novelty and more fine tuning, related to letter orientation. We employed an oddball fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm with magnetoencephalography (Elekta VectorView, 306 sensors) to study neural discrimination responses in the source space. Using contrasts between native letters and foreign letters, digits, or inverted native letters, we aimed to isolate the neural responses to visual novelty, category, and orientation during character analysis. The study was conducted with a cohort of 25 adults. The response topography demonstrated bilateral organization, including language-related brain regions as ventral occipitotemporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and middle temporal areas. Comparing conditions, we revealed right lateralized parietal clusters, associated with novelty tuning, and left lateralized occipitotemporal clusters exhibiting higher activity for letters among digits discrimination, supporting the role of this area in letter processing. No distinct spatial patterns specific to orientation tuning were observed in comparison to novelty and category tuning. We proposed that expertise-dependent orientation-specific tuning mechanisms may operate within an embedded, spatially overlapping with coarse tuning neural framework, characterized by special spatiotemporal patterns.",

      "title": "Flexible brain state engagement predicts cognitive control transdiagnostically",
      "content": "Cognitive control supports adaptive responses in an ever-changing world. While alterations in cognitive control have been consistently observed in a range of psychiatric disorders, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this behavioral variation remain elusive. Here, we tested whether the ability to flexibly recruit recurring brain activation patterns (i.e., brain states) may serve as an intermediate phenotype supporting cognitive control in individuals with a spectrum of clinical symptoms. We leveraged machine learning and external validation to explore this question in three independent, transdiagnostic datasets (N>600), including participants with anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorder. To capture the multifaceted nature of cognitive control, we assessed two of its components, inhibition and shift, using both task-based and questionnaire data. Flexible brain state engagement predicted all cognitive control metrics in previously unseen individuals transdiagnostically, regardless of which dataset was used for model training. Connectome-based predictive modeling also revealed that shared brain networks underpinned flexible brain state engagement in a transdiagnostic manner. Leveraging brain network dynamics, we further observed that moments of more flexible brain state engagement aligned with moments of network connectivity related to better cognitive control within the same individual. This temporal alignment was replicated in all three datasets with heterogeneous samples. Altogether, this study provides robust evidence that flexible engagement of brain state may support both inter- and intra-individual differences in cognitive control across individuals with diverse mental health profiles.",

      "content": "The midbrain dopamine system is important for linking reward-predictive cues to learning and motivation. Here we investigated how dopamine neuron responses to food and water cues are modulated by changes in internal state. We developed a flexible cued-approach task that allowed us to examine behavioral and neural responses to both food- and water-predictive cues within the same recording session. We found that overlapping subsets of dopamine neurons respond to food and water cues, but that the magnitude of these responses is gated in a need-specific way. Stimulation of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons amplified dopamine neuron responses to food cues, but not water cues, and the magnitude of these responses exceeded those observed in natural hunger. These findings indicate that changes in internal state modulate, in a need-appropriate way, the responses of a common set of dopamine neurons to environmental signals of food and water availability.",

      "title": "Pleasant touch mediated by A\u03b2-afferents remains primarily dependent on tactile velocity",
      "content": "Pleasantness of touch is classically attributed to C-tactile (CT) afferents, based on multiple evidence showing identical inverted-U curves as a function of velocities for pleasantness and CT activity. Recent research suggests that pleasant touch is not solely mediated by CT activation, pointing to a potential contribution of A{beta}-afferents and cognitive processes, potentially through the mechanism of velocity inference. To investigate the contributions of A{beta}-afferents, our study compared the illusion of vibrotactile apparent motion, which recruits almost exclusively A{beta}-afferents, and brush stroking, which additionally recruits CT afferents. A first experiment investigated the impact of stroke contrast on the pleasantness of 3 cm/s strokes by mingling them with pleasant (1 and 10 cm/s) or less pleasant (0.5 and 30 cm/s) ones. A second experiment in virtual reality probed velocity inference from visual cue by testing how congruence between visual and tactile velocity affects perceived pleasantness. The results showed that the pleasantness of strokes targeting A{beta}-afferents also follows an inverted U-curve and that 3 cm/s reference strokes remained unaffected by the speed of mixed strokes regardless of the condition. Even though differences in incongruence were not clearly perceived, discrepant visual velocities influenced the pleasantness of vibrotactile 1 cm/s strokes, for which the pleasantness ratings followed the visual rather than the tactile velocity. Overall, vibrotactile pleasantness can be mediated by A{beta}-afferents, but most probably through velocity inference since only vibrotactile strokes were prone to visual illusion. Because not clearly detected, visual inferences could have played a stronger role through larger speed discrepancies.",

      "title": "Exploring Stress-Induced Neural Circuit Remodeling through Data-Driven Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Simulation",
      "content": "Chronic stress induces behavioral rigidity and neural circuit remodeling, yet the underlying computational mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we analyze in vivo GCaMP8s recordings from the amygdala-striatal circuits (Giovanniello et al.) and identify a difference in the recovery dynamics of the BLA-DMS and CeA-DMS pathways following acute perturbations. Through data analysis and artificial neural network modeling, we find that structural asymmetry and functional separation--formalized by distinct optimization objectives--are necessary for simulating the experimental results. This suggests that the divergent functions of the BLA-DMS (exploration/precision) and CeA-DMS (stabilization/homeostasis) pathways are inherent, not learned. Under chronic stress, the brain adapts by strengthening the CeA-DMS pathway's stabilizing role. A robustness test (10 independent seeds) confirmed the statistical reliability of the results (e.g., Recovery Time difference), yet revealed a high Coefficient of Variation in pathway coupling weights ( approximately 40%), suggesting the brain preserves structural flexibility even while enforcing rigid functional outcomes. The model replicates the observed outcomes, suggesting that the chronic stress is computationally equivalent to a gain shift favoring the stable CeA-DMS pathway.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",
