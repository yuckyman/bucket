      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Spatial frequency adaptation modulates population receptive field sizes",
      "content": "The spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the early visual cortical regions is related to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in...",

Low vision affects more than two billion people worldwide and imposes a sustained personal and socioeconomic burden. Conventional rehabilitation emphasizes optical aids and environmental modification without directly stimulating the visual pathway....",

To address these challenges, this article proposes an event-aware ES-YOLO framework, and develops a pipeline defect inspection experimental environment that utilizes a hyper-redundant manipulator (HRM) to insert an event camera into the pipeline in a collision-free...",
