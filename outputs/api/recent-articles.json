      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Decoding of speech acoustics from EEG: going beyond the amplitude envelope",
      "content": "Objective. During speech perception, properties of the acoustic stimulus can be reconstructed from the listener\u2019s brain using methods such as electroencephalography (EEG). Most studies employ the amplitude envelope as a target for decoding; however, speech acoustics can be characterised on multiple dimensions, including as spectral descriptors. The current study assesses how robustly an extended acoustic feature set can be decoded from EEG under varying levels of intelligibility and acoustic clarity. Approach. Analysis was conducted using EEG from 38 young adults who heard intelligible and non-intelligible speech that was either unprocessed or spectrally degraded using vocoding. We extracted a set of acoustic features which, alongside the envelope, characterised instantaneous properties of the speech spectrum (e.g. spectral slope) or spectral change over time (e.g. spectral flux). We establish the robustness of feature decoding by employing multiple model architectures and, in the case of linear decoders, by standardising decoding accuracy (Pearson\u2019s r) using randomly permuted surrogate data. Main results. Linear models yielded the highest r relative to non-linear models. However, the separate decoder architectures produced a similar pattern of results across features and experimental conditions. After converting r values to Z-scores scaled by random data, we observed substantive differences in the noise floor between features. Decoding accuracy significantly varies by spectral degradation and speech intelligibility for some features, but such differences are reduced in the most robustly decoded features. This suggests acoustic feature reconstruction is primarily driven by generalised auditory processing. Significance. Our results demonstrate that linear decoders perform comparably to non-linear decoders in capturing the EEG response to speech acoustic properties beyond the amplitude envelope, with the reconstructive accuracy of some features also associated with understanding and spectral clarity. This sheds light on how sound properties are differentially represented by the brain and shows potential for clinical applications moving forward.",

      "title": "Temporal interference stimulator realized with silicon chip for non-invasive neuromodulation",
      "content": "Objective. Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) has emerged as an innovative and promising approach for non-invasive stimulation. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy and performance of TIS using benchtop instruments, a dedicated system-on-chip for TIS applications has not yet been reported. This work addresses this gap by presenting a design for a TIS chip that enhances portability, thereby facilitating wearable applications of TIS. Approach. A miniaturized dual-channel temporal interference stimulator for non-invasive neuro-modulation is proposed and fabricated in a 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS BCD process. The TIS chip occupies the silicon area of only 2.66 mm2. It generates output signals with a maximum amplitude of \u00b15 V and reliable frequency, with programmable input parameters to accommodate diverse biomedical applications. The carrier frequencies of the generated signals include 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz, combined with beat frequencies of 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz. This results in a total of nine available operation modes, enabling effective TIS. Main results. The proposed chip has effectively generated temporally interfering signals with reliable frequency and amplitude. To validate the efficacy of the TIS chip, in-vivo animal experiments have been conducted, demonstrating its ability to produce effective electrical stimulation signals that successfully elicit neural responses in the deep brain of a pig. Significance. This work has replaced the bulky external stimulator with a fully integrated silicon chip, significantly enhancing portability and supporting future wearable clinical applications.",
