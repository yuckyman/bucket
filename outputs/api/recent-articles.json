      "title": "Introducing a translationally relevant mouse model of radiosurgery-induced unilateral hearing loss",
      "content": "Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely used to treat vestibular schwannomas but may cause irreversible hearing loss due to cochlear toxicity. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and no effective otoprotective therapies exist. We aimed to establish a mouse model that replicates the clinical pattern of radiation-induced hearing loss. Methods: C57BL/6J mice (n=31) received 8Gy (n=3), 16Gy (n=5), 24Gy (n=8), or 32Gy (n=15) using the Leksell Gamma Knife ICON system. Targeting was based on the built-in cone-beam CT, co-registered with MRI and CT-based mouse atlases, to guide unilateral cochlea targeting. A single isocenter was placed lateral to the right cochlea, with the 80% isodose line traversing its medial edge. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks post-SRS. A 32Gy subgroup (n=7) was evaluated at 16 weeks. Histological analysis of cochleae was performed at 4 weeks in all groups and at 16 weeks in the long-term 32Gy group. Results: SRS was well tolerated, and the contralateral cochlea received a very low radiation dose. No ABR shifts were observed at 8 or 16Gy, with only minimal histological changes. At 32Gy, ABR threshold shifts at 22.6 and 32kHz were evident by week1 and worsened by week4. Similar but milder effects occurred at 24Gy. In the 32Gy long-term subgroup, hearing loss progressed across all frequencies, most severely at high frequencies, alongside a sustained wave I amplitude decline. At 32 Gy, outer hair cells were reduced by 14% and 44% at 32 and 45.2 kHz, respectively, at 4 weeks, and by 38% and 80% at 16 weeks. Ribbon synapses were mildly reduced at 4 weeks and more markedly at 16 weeks in corresponding high-frequency regions. Spiral ganglion neuron density was mildly reduced at the basal and middle turns. All reported changes were statistically significant when compared to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: This new model reproduces key features of SRS-induced cochlear toxicity, including unilateral, dose-dependent, and progressive hearing loss. It thus provides a valuable platform for investigating mechanisms and testing otoprotective strategies.",

      "title": "Rapid fluorescence lifetime sensor development of LifeCamp enables transient and baseline absolute calcium measurements",
      "content": "Genetically encoded calcium sensors (GECIs) have been instrumental for studying neuronal activity and intracellular signaling. GECIs are typically fluorescence-intensity sensors that change brightness upon calcium binding. Iterative improvements in GECIs have yielded indicators that report action potential-evoked calcium entry with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, enabling measurement of network activity across thousands of neurons. However, fluorescence intensity-based measurements generally cannot report baseline or absolute calcium levels and may confound neuromodulatory regulation of calcium handling with changes in action potential firing. Fluorescence lifetime sensors are insensitive to many artifacts that plague intensity-based measures and report absolute substrate levels, including those at rest. However, relatively few lifetime sensors for neuronal signals exist, and developing new sensors is typically difficult and low-yield. Here, we introduce a new rapid lifetime sensor development (RALISED) platform, which we use to build a new GCaMP8m-based high-speed lifetime calcium sensor, termed LifeCamp. We show that LifeCamp enables comparison of baseline calcium signals in cell culture, brain slices, and mice. In addition, we show that LifeCamp enables the detection of fast action potential-evoked calcium transients in single neurons from brain slices and in behaving mice. Using LifeCamp, we discovered calcium baseline changes associated with neuronal activity in brain slices and behaving mice, as well as slow average calcium changes in neuronal populations of freely moving mice. Altogether, this study highlights the utility of the RALISED method to rapidly develop new lifetime sensors and the application of the LifeCamp calcium lifetime sensor to study fast and slow calcium signaling.",

      "title": "Timing matters: exon skipping therapy is most effective when initiated early in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "content": "Exon skipping is a leading therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive muscle wasting disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene that typically disrupt the translation reading frame. This approach aims to modulate DMD pre-mRNA splicing to re-frame the transcript and generate an internally deleted but partially functional quasi-dystrophin protein. Four exon skipping drugs have received FDA accelerated approval, although their clinical efficacy is very limited. To investigate how treatment timing influences exon skipping outcomes, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were injected with peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PPMO) exon skipping conjugates beginning at either the adult (12-week) or aged (75-week) stages, and tibialis anterior muscles harvested for biochemical and transcriptomic analyses. Mean Dmd exon 23 skipping was 79% in adults and 44% in aged PPMO-treated mdx mice, whereas dystrophin protein restoration was 35% and 8%, respectively. Histopathological improvements were only evident in the adult-treated mice. PPMO-treatment in adult mdx mice induced a broad transcriptomic shift towards a wild-type signature, whereas treatment in aged mice resulted in negligible gene expression changes, indicating that late intervention is ineffective at reversing disease-associated pathologies despite low-level dystrophin restoration. Dystrophin transcript imbalance was corrected only in adult-treated mdx mice. Increased expression of the dystrophin-repressing microRNA miR-31-5p, which was more strongly upregulated in aged mdx muscle, provides a potential mechanistic explanation. In conclusion, PPMO-mediated exon skipping is substantially more effective when initiated in adult rather than aged dystrophic muscle, supporting early therapeutic intervention in DMD-affected individuals.",

      "content": "Major depressive disorder arises from diverse neurobiological mechanisms, yet how specific habenular cell types contribute to distinct depressive-like behaviours remains unclear. Using chronic social defeat stress, behavioural phenotyping, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped stress-induced transcriptional changes across habenular cell types and lateral habenula (LHb) subregions. Our findings reveal that each behavioural phenotype is marked by its own transcriptional profile. These subregion-specific patterns across the LHb suggest that different cellular circuits contribute uniquely to depressive-like states.",
