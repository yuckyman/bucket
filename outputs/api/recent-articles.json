      "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Mesa's new unified scheduling API: Rethinking how time works in agent-based models",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I'm one of the maintainers of <a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa\">Mesa</a>, the Python framework for agent-based modeling. We're working on a pretty significant change to how models handle time and event scheduling, and I think (hope) it's a cool demonstration of user API design.</p> <h3>The problem</h3> <p>Right now, Mesa has two separate systems for advancing time. The traditional approach looks like this:</p> <p><code>python model = MyModel() for _ in range(100): model.step() </code></p> <p>Simple, but limited. If you want discrete event simulation (where things happen at irregular intervals), you need to use our experimental <code>Simulator</code> classes: a completely separate API that feels (and is) bolted on rather than integrated.</p> <h3>The new approach</h3> <p>We're unifying everything into a single, clean API that lives directly on the Model. Here's what it looks like:</p> <p>```python from mesa import Model from mesa.timeflow import scheduled</p> <p>class WolfSheep(Model): @scheduled # Runs every 1 time unit by default def step(self): self.agents.shuffle_do(&quot;step&quot;)</p> <p>model = WolfSheep() model.run_for(100) # Run for 100 time units ```</p> <p>The <code>@scheduled</code> decorator marks methods for automatic recurring execution. You can customize the interval:</p> <p>```python @scheduled(interval=7) # Weekly def collect_statistics(self): ...</p> <p>@scheduled(interval=0.5) # Twice per time unit def physics_update(self): ... ```</p> <h3>Start simple, add complexity</h3> <p>The real power comes from mixing regular stepping with one-off events:</p> <p>```python class EpidemicModel(Model): def <strong>init</strong>(self): super().<strong>init</strong>() # Schedule a one-time event self.schedule_at(self.introduce_vaccine, time=50)</p> <pre><code>@scheduled def step(self): self.agents.shuffle_do(&quot;step&quot;) def introduce_vaccine(self): # This fires once at t=50 self.vaccine_available = True </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>Agents can even schedule their own future actions:</p> <p>```python class Prisoner(Agent): def get_arrested(self, sentence): self.in_jail = True self.model.schedule_after(self.release, delay=sentence)</p> <pre><code>def release(self): self.in_jail = False </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>And for pure discrete event simulation (no regular stepping at all):</p> <p>```python class QueueingModel(Model): def <strong>init</strong>(self, arrival<em>rate): super().</em><em>init</em>_() self.schedule_at(self.customer_arrival, time=0)</p> <pre><code>def customer_arrival(self): Customer(self) # Schedule next arrival (Poisson process) next_time = self.time + self.random.expovariate(arrival_rate) self.schedule_at(self.customer_arrival, time=next_time) </code></pre> <p>model = QueueingModel(arrival_rate=2.0) model.run_until(1000.0) # Time jumps: 0 \u2192 0.3 \u2192 0.8 \u2192 1.2... ```</p> <h3>Run control methods</h3> <p><code>python model.run_for(100) # Run for 100 time units model.run_until(500) # Run until time reaches 500 model.run_while(lambda m: m.running) # Run while condition is true model.run_next_event() # Step through events one at a time </code></p> <h3>Design considerations</h3> <p>We kept in mind our wide user base: both students who just starting to learn ABM and PhD-level research. We try to allow progressive complexity: Start simple with <code>@scheduled</code> + <code>run_for()</code>, add events as needed</p> <p>There's now no more second tier: both paradigms are a first-class citizen</p> <p>What's also cool that agents can schedule their own future actions naturally, not everything has to be controlled centrally. This leads to complex patterns and emergent behavior (a very important concept in ABM).</p> <p>Finally we're quite proud that's it's fully backward compatible, that was very hard to get right.</p> <h3>Current status</h3> <p>This is in active development (<a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/3155\">PR #3155</a>), so any insights (both on the specific PR and on a higher level) are appreciated!</p> <p>The (extensive) design discussion is in <a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2921\">#2921</a> if you want to dive deeper.</p> <p>If you're more interested in the process of designing a new API in a larger community for a library with a varied user base, we recently wrote up our perspective on that: <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#mesa-development-process\">Mesa development process</a>.</p> <h3>What's next</h3> <p>We're also <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/discussions/2921#discussioncomment-15524497\">designing</a> a more advanced <code>schedule()</code> method for complex patterns:</p> <p>```python</p> <h1>Poisson arrivals with stochastic intervals</h1> <p>model.schedule(customer_arrival, interval=lambda m: m.random.expovariate(2.0))</p> <h1>Run only during market hours, stop after 100 executions</h1> <p>model.schedule(trade, interval=1, only_if=lambda m: m.market_open, count=100)</p> <h1>Seasonal events</h1> <p>@scheduled(interval=1, only_if=lambda m: 90 &lt;= m.time % 365 &lt; 180) def breeding_season(self): ... ```</p> <p>I hope you guys find something like this interesting and it will lead to fruitful a discussion!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf9ns8/mesas_new_unified_scheduling_api_rethinking_how/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf9ns8/mesas_new_unified_scheduling_api_rethinking_how/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
      "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.
