      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the changes in the global attributes of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) graph theory, as well as the coupling topological structure of the whole brain SC-FC in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).Methods57 NIHL patients and 55 health controls (HCs) were included; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, clinical data (scales, laboratory indicators) were collected. The graph theory network analysis of SC and FC, the whole-brain SC-FC coupling were performed, and a correlation analysis was employed to analyze the results in relation to the clinical data.ResultsFor FC, there was no significant difference in the global indices directly between groups (P > 0.05, FDR corrected). For SC, the normalized clustering coefficient (\u03b3) and small-worldness (\u03c3) of the NIHL were higher than those of the HCs (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). There was no significant difference in the SC-FC coupling strength of whole brain between two groups (P > 0.05). The graph attribute indices and coupling values of NIHL were correlated to varying degrees with the results of anxiety scale, coagulation, inflammation and biochemical indices (P < 0.05).ConclusionThe brain network topology structure of NIHL patients is abnormal, but the SC-FC coupling strength does not change significantly. This may provide a basis for understanding the theoretical mechanism of brain neural function remodeling and for future more detailed and diverse studies.",

      "title": "Functional organization underlying superior performance in a memory champion",
      "content": "Memory athletes can achieve superior performance (e.g., memorizing 339 digits in 5 minutes) with extensive daily training, by converting abstract information into vivid scenes, and placing them along a mental path, that is then retraced at recall (Method of Loci). Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying such training-dependent performance could suggest novel brain-based approaches to improve learning and cognitive performance in other domains. As each memory athlete uses individual-specific, personalized training techniques, it has been challenging to study them at the group level. Fortunately, precision functional mapping (PFM) which uses repeated sampling of resting state functional connectivity and task fMRI, enables detailed study of individual brains. Here, we map the brain organization of a 6-time U.S. Memory Champion (>13 hours fMRI) and compare it to control data. We observe focal functional connectivity differences in the memory champion's retrosplenial, extrastriate visual, and dorsal frontal cortex (area 55b), as well as in the caudate. These suggest additional recruitment of scene and semantic processing in the athlete, alongside a stronger integration of the caudate with memory-related networks. A control rote memorization task elicits typical activation patterns in the athlete, but when using the Method of Loci, his pattern on activation differs: his hippocampal activation was larger during recall than encoding and he recruited regions showing connectivity differences compared to controls. His unique circuit for Method of Loci, incorporates regions typically used for navigation, scene processing, language and associative learning.",

      "title": "Sexually dimorphic plasticity of PV inhibition in sensory neocortex during learning",
      "content": "Neocortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons critically regulate circuit excitation by strong synaptic inputs onto local pyramidal (Pyr) neurons. Plasticity in PV-mediated inhibition during learning could have pronounced effects on gating excitatory synaptic plasticity and circuit excitability, but experimental evidence to support this input- and target-specific plasticity is scant. Here, we combined in vitro electrophysiology with quantitative synapse analysis to determine whether training in a whisker-based sensory-association task could alter PV-mediated inhibition in the primary somatosensory cortex of mice. Using light-evoked activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing PV neurons, we found that evoked PV-IPSCs in Pyr neurons from layer (L) 2/3, but not L5, were rapidly suppressed at the onset of training. This reduction was sex-specific, occurring only in females. The training-related decrease in PV output was accompanied by a reduced number of PV-associated synapses on both the soma and dendrites of L2/3 Pyr neurons, suggesting a postsynaptic structural change. Notably, when whisker stimulation was decoupled from the water reward during pseudotraining, PV-mediated inhibition remained stable. Thus, reduced PV inhibition in superficial layers is an early response to the development of stimulus-reward associations during sensory learning. In addition, these data underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in studies of learning-related cortical plasticity.",
