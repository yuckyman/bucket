      "title": "A Multimodal Atlas Reveals the Anatomical Distribution of Medium Spiny Neuron Subtypes and a Novel RGS6+ Population in the Primate Striatum",
      "content": "The primate striatum and its principal neuron type, the medium spiny neuron (MSN), integrate cortical and subcortical signals related to movement, cognition, and emotion. These signals are processed through cell type specific circuits traditionally defined by MSN dopamine receptor expression. However, classification by dopamine receptor type alone fails to fully specify MSN diversity and falls short of capturing the functional complexity of the striatum. Here, we combined single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing and high-plex spatial transcriptomics to build a comprehensive atlas of MSNs in the macaque striatum. Using multi-omic sequencing, we profiled MSNs across four anatomically and functionally defined territories, and we mapped these subtypes back into their anatomical context by integrating the multi-omic data with ~5.4 million spatially resolved cells sampled across the full rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral extent of the striatum. This approach revealed two previously undocumented ventral striatum (VS) subtypes, D1-VS-RGS6 and D2-VS-RGS6, which are molecularly distinct from known ventral striatal MSNs yet share core limbic features. We also uncovered gradients in matrix-compartment cell types along the rostral-caudal axis. Finally, by integrating MSN subtype-specific transcriptomes and ATAC-seq-derived regulatory annotations with human GWAS data, we demonstrate strong, cell-type-specific enrichment of polygenic risk for Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and psychiatric and cognitive traits, including a striking association of D2-VS-RGS6 with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, this multimodal atlas provides a foundation for linking primate striatal cell types to circuit function and disease mechanisms.",

      "title": "From Tasks to Topology: Dorsal and Ventral Streams Emerge in Optimized Neural Networks",
      "content": "The primate visual system is organized into dorsal and ventral pathways, classically linked to visuomotor control and perception. A long-standing question is whether this division reflects intrinsic architectural priors or emerges from task demands. We trained a single convolutional network to perform classification and grasp prediction of 3D objects, without imposing modular structure. Dual-stream topology - functionally distinct visuomotor and perceptual pathways - emerged spontaneously with rich cross-communication. Shapley value analyses revealed that action- and perception-selective features developed progressively across depth, reflecting task-driven hierarchical specialization. Time-resolved EEG showed that model activity mapped onto dissociable temporal components in human cortex: ventral-aligned signals emerged early and late, where dorsal- and ventral-aligned responses coincided in the intervening interval. These results demonstrate that task optimization alone can explain core features of dorsal-ventral organization, and that distinct temporal roles for perception and action arise naturally atop a shared feedforward scaffold, without requiring architectural hard-coding or recurrence.",

      "title": "Comparative Cilia Analysis in the Cerebral Cortices of Turtles, Mice, and Macaques",
      "content": "Primary cilia are centriole-derived sensory organelles found in most vertebrate cells including neurons. In the mouse neocortex, the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are found to orient predominantly toward the pia, reflecting a reverse movement that occurs during postnatal neuronal repositioning. This study compared cilia orientation in principal excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex across turtles, mice, and macaques to identify patterns to infer mechanisms of cortical evolution. We first developed custom MATLAB Apps to facilitate the fast identification and statistical analyses of cilia orientation. We found that generally the primary cilia of principal neurons in sparse inside-out laminated regions, including the macaque and mouse neocortex, macaque CA1, mouse entorhinal cortex and neighboring regions, and mouse piriform cortex layer III, orient toward the pia. In contrast, primary cilia in compact laminae of these species, including the macaque and mouse dentate gyrus (DG), macaque CA3, mouse piriform cortex layer II, and turtle lateral cortex manifest opposite orientations, positioning perpendicular to the laminae. These data suggest that over the course of cortical evolution, primary cilia in principal neurons evolve from initially having no preferred orientation to becoming increasingly oriented toward the pial surface. We propose a working model for cortical evolution: the placement of principal neurons progresses from minimal migration in lower vertebrates to forward migration in higher species, and ultimately to pronounced reverse soma movement in higher inside-out laminated cortices, driven by the accumulation of large neuronal populations in the outer layers after completing radial migration.",

      "title": "Neural ensembles for music production recruit more language instruments as rhythmic complexity increases",
      "content": "Language and music, two core forms of human communication, both rely on rhythmic control. To date, the neural ensembles supporting their real-time production are not fully characterized. Using rapid phase-encoded fMRI, we mapped the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of overt language and music production under varying rhythm control demands. We observed overlapping hemodynamic traveling waves across domains, with auditory-motor regions activated earlier, followed by visual, posterior parietal, and Sylvian parietal-temporal (Spt) regions, supporting sensorimotor transformation and online monitoring of production. Increasing rhythmic complexity elicited slower and stronger activations in both domains: compared with baseline, regular rhythm control elicited delayed and amplified responses, while irregular rhythm control produced the slowest and strongest responses. During music production, rhythm-related activity expanded into frontal and temporal language regions, suggesting that higher rhythmic demands engage language resources. These findings reveal dynamic neural ensembles that can flexibly reconfigure shared resources to support temporal precision in sequence production.",

      "title": "Orthogonal representational geometry in dACC underpins human hierarchical reasoning",
      "content": "Flexible adaptation requires inferring the causes of feedback and adjusting accordingly. When tasks are hierarchically structured with high-level rules governing low-level perceptual judgements, good performance requires hierarchical reasoning. Yet the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, building on Bayesian modelling and recurrent neural network simulation of hierarchical reasoning, we verified that such algorithm and representations are implemented in human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). dACC encodes accumulated errors and perceptual difficulty to estimate high-level rule switch confidence. These two variables were represented along two separable dimensions, and could be approximated by Gaussian basis functions. Orthogonality between these two dimensions yielded an optimal two-dimensional representation for hierarchical reasoning. A closer-to-orthogonal representational geometry also predicted better performance. Together, these findings provide an integrated computational and neural representational basis for hierarchical reasoning.",
