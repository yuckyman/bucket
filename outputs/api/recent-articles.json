      "content": "Glomeruli are signal-processing units of the olfactory bulb (OB), playing a key role in many OB computations, including contrast enhancement, gain control, and odorant-selective habituation. In awake mice, we uncover an extremely stable inhomogeneous map of basal glomerulus-specific activity as a background against which olfactory signal processing is performed. This activity is strongly driven by (i) centrifugal cholinergic projections, (ii) endogenous, and (iii) airflow-evoked spiking of olfactory sensory neurons and, to a small extent, (iv) by the odor environment. Importantly, early olfactory impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease is parallelled by the loss of glomerular map inhomogeneity and diminished cholinergic innervation. These results reveal an important layer in the signal-processing network of the OB, likely acting by increasing the variance in and dynamic range of the system via glomerulus-specific functional inhomogeneity.",

      "title": "Spontaneous differentiation across cell lineages of separate germ layer origin during progenitor cell-mediated regeneration of the central nervous system",
      "content": "Under homeostatic conditions, axons of the central nervous system (CNS) are myelinated by oligodendrocytes. However, in response to demyelination, Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), can contribute to CNS remyelination. Lineage tracing studies demonstrated that many CNS remyelinating SCs, in addition to remyelinating oligodendrocytes, are derived from adult CNS stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here we describe the mechanisms by which the fate switch of neuroepithelial-derived OPCs into SCs, a cell normally of neural crest origin, occurs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing we identified a subpopulation of OPCs within demyelinating lesions that co-express SC markers. Within this SC-primed group, differential gene analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in integrin signalling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activation. We found that BMP4 and vitronectin, an extracellular matrix molecule and integrin ligand, are sufficient external cues to induce SC differentiation by OPCs by directly exerting effects on the transcription factors OLIG2 and SOX10, which are critical regulators of cell fate in oligodendroglial cells and SCs. We also show that OPCs can be directly programmed toward a SC fate by suppressing the expression levels of Olig2 and while maintaining those of Sox10. OPC-derived SCs morphologically and transcriptionally resemble primary SCs and can myelinate CNS axons with peripheral type myelin. Our findings indicate that injury-related changes in the environment can destabilise oligodendroglial transcription factor networks, enabling alternative OPC fate choices during CNS remyelination.",

      "title": "Quantitative phosphoproteomics uncovers the signalling dynamics of hallucinogenic psychedelics",
      "content": "Psychedelic drugs can induce intense changes in perception and thought, and some also promote long-lasting adaptations in brain circuits that are being explored for treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. How these compounds differ at the level of intracellular signalling, and how hallucinogenic drugs diverge from related non-hallucinogenic forms, is poorly understood. A central question is whether a shared molecular fingerprint distinguishes hallucinogenic psychedelic action from other forms of receptor activation in neurons. Here, we show that chemically diverse psychedelics trigger a coordinated reorganisation of phosphorylation patterns across many proteins in neural cells, and that this global signalling response contains a distinct signature that separates hallucinogenic compounds from non-hallucinogenic counterparts of similar structure. We use a glycolysis-regulating transcription factor as an example of the signature functional relevance to show that hallucinogenic psychedelics, but not their non-hallucinogenic analogues, enhance markers of glycolytic metabolism. These findings reveal that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic psychedelics engage separable intracellular architectures, and establish a framework for understanding how different psychoactive compounds couple receptor activation to specific cellular states. More broadly, this work opens a path to using signalling fingerprints to guide the design of psychedelic-inspired therapeutics with tailored behavioural and metabolic profiles.",

      "title": "Shared feedback control principles across standing and walking",
      "content": "Feedback control is required to maintain stability in both walking and standing, whereas the control parameters may differ due to the inherently different characteristics of these tasks. How feedback is adapted between tasks is unclear. To address this, we applied a unified feedback model, relating preceding center of mass position and velocity information to corrective ground reaction forces, to estimate and compare the control parameters between walking and standing. 15 healthy young participants (21+/- 4 yrs, 63 +/- 9 kg, 1.70 +/- 0.10 m, 13 females, 2 males) participated, they walked at 4.5 km/h for 5 minutes, and performed 3 different standing tasks: normal standing, unipedal standing, and step posture for 1 minute, repeated 5 times. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and used to fit the feedback model and estimate feedback delay and gains. Results showed good model fits for both walking and standing with mean R2-values higher than 0.69. The feedback delay was significantly longer in walking than in standing. While the feedback position gains and velocity gains varied significantly across tasks and directions, position gains were mostly above critical stiffness and velocity gains all at under-damped level, with as only exception that position gains in the AP direction in walking, which were slightly below critical stiffness. The ratio of position to velocity gains in all tasks remained consistently close to the eigenfrequency (sqrt(g/l)) as predicted by the extrapolated center of mass concept. Our findings suggest a robust control strategy in which the sensorimotor system maintains a relative consistent weighting between position and velocity feedback for walking and standing.",

      "title": "complexipy 5.0.0, cognitive complexity tool",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>! I've released the version <a href=\"https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy/releases/tag/5.0.0\">v5.0.0</a>. This version introduces new changes that will improve the tool adoption in existing projects and the cognitive complexity algorithm itself.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p><code>complexipy</code> is a command-line tool and library that calculates the cognitive complexity of Python code. Unlike cyclomatic complexity, which measures how complex code is to test, cognitive complexity measures how difficult code is for humans to read and understand.</p> <p><strong>Target audience</strong></p> <p><code>complexipy</code> is built for:</p> <ul> <li>Python developers who care about readable, maintainable code.</li> <li>Teams who want to enforce quality standards in CI/CD pipelines.</li> <li>Open-source maintainers looking for automated complexity checks.</li> <li>Developers who want real-time feedback in their editors or pre-commit hooks.</li> <li>Researcher scientists, during this year I noticed that many researchers used <code>complexipy</code> during their investigations on LLMs generating code.</li> </ul> <p>Whether you're working solo or in a team, <code>complexipy</code> helps you keep complexity under control.</p> <p><strong>Comparison to Alternatives</strong></p> <p><code>Sonar</code> has the original version which runs online only in GitHub repos, and it's a slower workflow because you need to push your changes, wait until their scanner finishes the analysis and check the results. I inspired from them to create this tool, that's why it runs locally without having to publish anything and the analysis is really fast.</p> <p><strong>Highlights of v5.0.0</strong></p> <ul> <li>Snapshots: <code>--snapshot-create</code> writes <code>complexipy-snapshot.json</code> and comparisons block regressions; auto-refresh on improvements, bypass with <code>--snapshot-ignore</code>.</li> <li>Change tracking: per-target cache in <code>.complexipy_cache</code> shows deltas/new failures for over-threshold functions using stable BLAKE2 keys.</li> <li>Output controls: <code>--failed</code> to show only violations; <code>--color auto|yes|no</code>; richer summaries of failing functions and invalid paths.</li> <li>Excludes and errors: exclude entries resolved relative to the root and only applied when they match real files/dirs; missing paths reported cleanly instead of panicking.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Breaking:</strong> Conditional scoring now counts each <code>elif</code>/<code>else</code> branch as +1 complexity (plus its boolean test), aligning with Sonar\u2019s cognitive-complexity rules; expect higher scores for branching.</p> <p>GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy\">https://github.com/rohaquinlop/complexipy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fexx3l\"> /u/fexx3l </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7fqbo/complexipy_500_cognitive_complexity_tool/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7fqbo/complexipy_500_cognitive_complexity_tool/\">[comments]</a></span>",
