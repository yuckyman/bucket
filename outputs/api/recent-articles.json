      "content": "In industrial automation, detecting defects in threaded components is challenging due to their complex geometry and the concealment of micro-flaws. This paper presents an integrated vision system capable of inspecting both internal and external threads with high robustness. A unified imaging platform ensures synchronized capture of thread surfaces, while advanced image enhancement techniques improve clarity under motion blur and low-light conditions. To overcome limited defect samples, we...",

      "content": "High-density tactile sensor arrays that replicate human touch could restore texture perception in paralyzed individuals. However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",

      "content": "It has been argued in previous research that several competing pressures guide the directions of language evolution (economy vs. redundancy; arbitrariness vs. systematicity). For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",
