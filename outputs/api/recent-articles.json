      "title": "Software and pipelines for registration and analyses of rodent brain image data in reference atlas space",
      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "Enhanced sensory perception and myoelectric control with high channel count implanted sensorimotor systems",
      "content": "Objective. Implanted electrodes for nerve stimulation and myoelectric recording facilitate bidirectional sensory feedback and control for neuromuscular conditions such as limb loss. While increasing implanted electrode channel count offers potential benefits, it also presents engineering and implementation challenges. This case study examines how increasing implanted electrode channel count affects sensory perception and myoelectric controller performance, thereby supporting the value of these advancements. Approach. One participant with upper extremity transradial limb loss received a percutaneous implanted system with two 8-channel extraneural cuff electrodes on the median and ulnar nerves, totaling 16 stimulating channels. The individual later received a wirelessly connected implanted system featuring four 16-channel extraneural cuff electrodes on the median, ulnar, and radial nerves, totaling 64 stimulation channels, and four tetra-intramuscular (TIM) recording electrodes in residual muscles, totaling 32 sensing channels configured into 16 bipolar pairs. To compare sensory perception between the 16- and 64-channel stimulation systems, we assessed cumulative percept location coverage and the number of unique percept locations, estimated through hierarchical clustering. We compared performance across three myoelectric control algorithms that mapped 8, 10, or 14 intramuscular signal inputs through an artificial neural network to control a virtual hand in 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), with simultaneous, independent, and proportional control. Main results. Increasing stimulation channel count expanded cumulative percept location coverage and increased the number of unique percept locations on the hand. Adding intramuscular recording channel inputs improved 4-DOF myoelectric control of a virtual hand, increasing target posture match percentage and path efficiency. Significance. This case study demonstrates that increasing the number of implanted electrodes can advance sensory restoration and myoelectric control for bidirectional upper limb prostheses. Continued development of more complex systems with higher channel counts may further improve outcomes for individuals with limb loss and enhance the function of sensorimotor restoration systems.
