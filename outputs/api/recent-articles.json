      "title": "Neonatal social communication and single genes predict the variability of post-pubertal social behavior in a mouse model of paternal 15q11-13 duplication",
      "content": "Mental illnesses associated with high-risk copy number variations (CNVs) are characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable severity, with their underlying mechanisms remaining inadequately understood. We hypothesized that such phenotypic variability is evident from the neonatal stage and is, at least in part, attributable to individual differences in the expression levels of CNV-encoded genes in the brain. We conducted an analysis of the quantitative and functional structure of neonatal social communication, assessed post-pubertal social interaction, and evaluated the brain expression levels of genes within the same cohort of a mouse model of paternal human 15q11-13 duplication, a high-risk factor variably associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Subsequently, computational methods were utilized to identify predictive variables for the variability of post-pubertal social interaction. Mice harboring the 15q11-13 duplication exhibited distinctive call sequences characterized by diverse connections, which lacked the incentive value necessary for effective social communication with mother mice. The neonatal call sequences and the expression levels of Magel2, along with, to a lesser extent, Herc2 and Ndn, in the prefrontal cortex of the 15q11-13 duplication model were predictive of post-pubertal social interaction. Our findings demonstrate that variability in post-pubertal social interaction, a dimensional characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders, can be predicted by the variability of neonatal social communication and is influenced by the expression levels of specific CNV-encoded genes in the prefrontal cortex. This computational approach has the potential to predict the developmental trajectories of various dimensions of mental illness among CNV carriers in humans and to identify CNV-encoded driver genes in preclinical models, thereby providing potential mechanistic bases for the development of gene-based therapeutic strategies",

      "content": "The self-reference effect (SRE) refers to the robust mnemonic advantage for self-relevant information and is characterised by a graded pattern spanning the self, close others, and distant others. Despite extensive behavioural evidence, causal evidence for the neural mechanisms supporting the SRE remains limited, particularly during incidental encoding and across source memory, metacognition, and emotional valence. We investigated the causal contributions of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to self-other episodic memory and metacognition using focal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). One hundred participants completed an incidental encoding task in which trait adjectives were rated with reference to the self, a close friend, or a celebrity, under anodal or sham stimulation to either region. Recognition tests assessed item and source memory sensitivity (d') and metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d') as a function of agent and emotional valence. Across stimulation conditions, a graded advantage for self-related information was observed in both item and source memory, extending to metacognitive efficiency. Anodal stimulation to either region enhanced recognition for celebrity-referenced items. PPC stimulation additionally biased source memory away from positive and towards negative information. These findings demonstrate shared and dissociable causal roles of dmPFC and PPC in self-other episodic memory.",

      "title": "Locus coeruleus noradrenaline elicits response profiles distinct from natural arousal in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes",
      "content": "During arousal and stress, the locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) throughout the brain, including hippocampus. It remains, however, unclear how LC activity contributes to the cellular response profiles observed during natural arousal. Here we directly compared effects of natural arousal and isolated LC activation in mouse CA1 using physiologically titrated optogenetics, combined with fiber photometry of NA and calcium signals, chronic two-photon imaging, and behavioral monitoring. We found that natural arousal robustly activated all three major cell types - astrocytes, pyramidal cells, and inhibitory interneurons - on a population level. In contrast, stimulation of the LC alone exerted a slow inhibitory influence on pyramidal cells and interneurons, with only a subset of interneurons exhibiting a transient activation by LC stimulation. Interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, segregated into functionally consistent LC-responsive subpopulations (activated vs inhibited) with distinct laminar positions in CA1. However, these LC-responsive subpopulations of interneurons did not reliably map onto response subpopulations defined by activity patterns during natural arousal. Astrocytes were strongly activated by both natural arousal and LC stimulation. However, single-cell responses of astrocytes to LC stimulation only partially aligned with their activity during natural arousal responses, indicating distinct driving forces across the two conditions. Together, these results show that LC-driven NA release produces distinct, cell-specific effects that do not align with hippocampal dynamics during natural arousal. Thus, our findings highlight the need to rethink how the locus coeruleus influences the main hippocampal cell types in vivo.",

      "title": "Feeling the music: Audiotactile encoding of temporal structure in the human brain",
      "content": "In everyday situations, like a rock party or an organ concert, we feel music vibrating through our bodies. How do these vibrotactile signals influence music processing? How do they aid auditory scene analysis? Combining psychophysics, fMRI and time-resolved EEG decoding, this work reveals how the brain encodes the temporal structure of music (beat and envelope) across audition and touch and uses this information to guide multisensory integration and segregation in simple and more complex perceptual scenes. Participants experienced monophonic and polyphonic piano pieces through auditory, vibrotactile and audiotactile stimulation. Vibrotactile signals improved the detection of a brief target embedded in music, establishing the functional relevance of audiotactile integration in naturalistic settings. fMRI and EEG multivariate decoding revealed that auditory and tactile beat information converged in planum temporale and parietal operculum, albeit through distinct neural dynamics and representations. Superior temporal cortices reliably encoded envelope information from audition, but only weakly from touch. Nevertheless, vibrotactile signals significantly enhanced neural encoding of auditory beat as early as 100 ms, and envelope representations from 250 ms onward. These encoding benefits were associated with superadditive interactions in primary auditory cortex, where tactile signals sharpen and amplify auditory envelope representations. In complex polyphonic music, touch further amplified the segregation and encoding of temporally coherent auditory streams. Our findings highlight the important, yet largely unexplored influence of touch on auditory processing, enriching music perception and supporting auditory scene analysis in real-world environments.",

      "title": "Cortical astrocytes control stress resilience",
      "content": "Background: Chronic stress exposure is a risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MDD), with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role in mediating this stress susceptibility. However, most individuals who are exposed to chronic stress are resilient and do not develop psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that glial cells, especially astrocytes, play an important role in controlling stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, yet their role in contributing to stress resilience is not understood. Methods: Using fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and RNA-sequencing in male mice, we establish a role for PFC astrocytes in stress resilience. Results: We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in astrocytic calcium activity are both necessary and sufficient for resilience. Bioinformatic analysis reveals robust transcriptional responses in PFC astrocytes that differ between susceptible vs. resilient mice and are unique when compared to astrocytic transcriptional changes in other limbic regions. Comparison with human RNA-sequencing data indicates that molecular changes observed in PFC astrocytes from susceptible mice converge with gene expression changes observed in MDD patients. Conclusions: Together, these data support targeting astrocytes as a potential therapy for negative behavioral consequences following stress exposure and reveal potential molecular mechanisms within PFC astrocytes that could contribute to depressive-like behaviors.",

      "title": "Sequential coupling of sleep oscillations enables concept-neuron reactivation and supports information flow across the human hippocampal-cortical circuit",
      "content": "Effective memory consolidation during sleep is thought to rely on the transfer of reactivated memory traces from the hippocampus to the cortex. However, the mechanisms supporting this essential dialogue across brain areas remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity (n = 1097) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of 10 epilepsy patients across 21 nights of sleep. Before sleep, patients engaged in a memory task with stimuli eliciting concept-neuron responses. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal firing locked to sharp wave-ripples (SWR) revealed a directed flow of information from the hippocampus to cortical targets. Notably, within SWR-driven activity, experience-dependent concept neurons exhibited elevated co-activation both within and across MTL regions, indicating selective reactivation of behaviorally relevant information. Cross-regional co-activation of concept cells was markedly enhanced when hippocampal SWRs coincided with cortical slow oscillation-spindle complexes, suggesting an active role of the cortex in shaping interregional communication. These findings provide evidence that SWRs in humans selectively reactivate experience-related neural ensembles across the hippocampal-cortical network, while synergistic interactions with cortical slow oscillation-spindle events might facilitate effective memory consolidation.",

      "title": "Temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed actions",
      "content": "Tactile sensitivity is temporally modulated on a moving limb. Yet the functional significance of this modulation remains unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed reaching. Participants reached for their unseen left hand while brief vibrations were applied to the moving right index finger in different movement phases. Psychophysical results revealed tactile suppression during reaching, with sensitivity improving around maximum speed relative to the late movement phase. The EEG results were consistent with the psychophysical data. Specifically, the short-latency P45 component, originating in primary somatosensory cortex, was suppressed during reaching, but recovered around maximum speed. Reduced P45 amplitudes were associated with stronger tactile suppression measured behaviorally, linking early cortical activity to perceptual changes. This temporally specific modulation of tactile perception associated with early cortical processing suggests that the somatosensory system dynamically adapts its sensitivity to facilitate sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions.",

      "title": "Show HN: GibRAM an in-memory ephemeral GraphRAG runtime for retrieval",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I have been working with regulation-heavy documents lately, and one thing kept bothering me. Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.<p>After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.<p>To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.<p>GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.<p>This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.<p>The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram</a><p>Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
