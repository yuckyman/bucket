      "title": "Injury-induced nuclear export of RNA-binding proteins drives mRNA stabilization and translation to promote dendrite regeneration",
      "content": "Dendrite regeneration is critical for restoring neuronal connectivity after injury, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using C. elegans as a model and through a forward genetic screen, we identified the conserved insulin degrading enzyme idr-1 and the RNA-binding protein rbm-42 as key regulators of dendrite regeneration, where idr-1 functions upstream of rbm-42. We further show that ced-7, one of the core components of the phagocytosis pathway, acting downstream of rbm-42, while other components of this pathway don't play significant roles in dendrite regeneration. In addition, we demonstrate that upon injury IDR-1 can promote RBM-42 nuclear export following injury, enabling its dendritic localization. RBM-42, in turn, promotes the translation of ced-7 and facilitates microtubule assembly. In conclusion, our findings define a novel conserved signaling cascade coupling injury-induced nuclear export of RNA binding proteins to local regulation and dendrite regeneration, providing new mechanistic insight into neuronal repair.",

      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterised by pervasive deposition of alpha-synuclein (-Syn) aggregates and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fc{gamma}RIIb or CD32b), the sole inhibitory Fc{gamma}R in humans (h) and mice (m), serves as a molecular conduit for intercellular -Syn transmission in-vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Fc{gamma}RIIb facilitates -Syn propagation and neurotoxicity in-vivo using the pre-formed fibril (PFF) -Syn model in mice. Genetic ablation of mFc{gamma}RII attenuated PFF -Syn-induced Lewy pathology, dampened associated neuroinflammatory responses, and preserved nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of hFc{gamma}RIIb using clinically-related monoclonal antibodies mitigated acute-phase -Syn pathology in hFc{gamma}RIIb-transgenic mice following PFF challenge. Collectively, our results indicate that Fc{gamma}RIIb is a mediator of -Syn propagation in-vivo and highlight it as a tractable therapeutic target against -synucleinopathies like PD.",

      "title": "Local differences in baseline sodium shape astrocytic potassium uptake by the NKA",
      "content": "Astrocytes are vital for the maintenance of ion and transmitter homeostasis in the extracellular space, with the inward Na gradient playing a pivotal role in these processes. Earlier studies not only reported a low baseline Na+ concentration ([Na+]) in astrocytes, but also suggested an equilibration of [Na+] within the gap-junction-coupled syncytium. This is consistent with the view that the basic homeostatic properties of astrocytes are largely identical due to their critical role in brain function. Here, we used multi-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging for a quantitative determination of astrocytic [Na+] in mouse forebrain tissue slices and in vivo. Contrary to the prevailing notion of a rather uniform Na distribution, we detected a previously unobserved subcellular and cellular heterogeneity in astrocytic [Na+], accompanied by differences in the capacity for Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-mediated uptake of extracellular K+. Biophysical modelling showed that this heterogeneity can be replicated by the reported differential expression of NKA isoforms in astrocytes together with a different strength of Na+ influx over the plasma membranes.

      "title": "A painless nerve growth factor variant uncouples nociceptive and neurotrophic TrkA signaling",
      "content": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, drives neurotrophic signaling essential for neuronal development and survival. This interaction simultaneously drives peripheral pain, making this pathway an attractive but complicated therapeutic target for chronic pain. By integrating single-molecule microscopy, structural and electrophysiology analyses, with a human NGF variant, NGFpainless, which retains neurotrophic effects but abolishes pain, we delineate the molecular mechanisms that bias TrkA signaling towards neurotrophic functions without triggering nociception. We show that, unlike wild-type NGF, NGFpainless fails to sensitize TRPV1 channels to capsaicin, thus disengaging TrkA from the nociceptive pathway. We further show that this selective loss of nociceptive TrkA signaling by NGFpainless results from its reduced ability to activate PLC{gamma}1 and trigger calcium release compared to NGF, while still preserving the ERK and AKT signaling essential for neurotrophic functions. This biased signaling arises from reduced electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless complex interface, which shortens the lifetime of this functional complex on native membranes. Mutations in TrkA that restore the electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless interface eliminate biased signaling. This mechanistic understanding of TrkA binding by NGFpainless, and how it differs from NGF, will spur the development of two therapeutic classes of molecules - one that selectively suppresses nociceptive signaling while preserving neurotrophic functions in chronic pain, and another that enhances neurotrophic activity without evoking peripheral pain in neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "title": "Nrg1 regulates cortical wiring and motor recovery upon traumatic injury",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability, yet molecular mechanisms supporting cortical repair remain poorly defined. While Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is essential for cortical development, its role in traumatic cortical injury in adults is unclear. To circumvent developmental confounds, we used an inducible conditional Nrg1 knockout in the adult mouse and subjected it to controlled cortical damage (CCD) in the motor cortex. We combined high-resolution adeno-associated viral tracing of callosal projections with comprehensive behavioral, histological, and molecular analyses. Nrg1 deletion led to significant impairments in structural connectivity and long-term motor recovery, which were markedly exacerbated in aged mice, indicating a critical role for Nrg1 in adult cortical repair. Mechanistically, our data indicated that Nrg1 promoted this plasticity through its intracellular domain (ICD) signaling, acting cell-autonomously to enhance axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, loss of Nrg1 was associated with altered structure of perineuronal-nets (PNN) and increased neuroinflammation at the lesion site. Our findings identify endogenous Nrg1 as a key regulator of structural preservation and functional recovery, highlighting the Nrg1 signaling as a potential target to enhance cortical plasticity after trauma.",

      "content": "Biallelic AAGGG expansions in RFC1 are associated with CANVAS and are increasingly recognised as a cause of adult-onset ataxia and sensory neuropathy. However, the disease-causing mechanisms remain unclear. Here we leveraged in vitro assays, post-mortem brain tissue, patient-derived cell lines and a neuronal RFC1 Drosophila model to demonstrate that AAGGG expansions are associated with tissue-specific reductions in the expression of RFC1 transcript, along with impaired RFC1 function and increased sensitivity to DNA damage from platin drugs. CRISPR/Cas9 excision of the AAGGG repeat and flanking AluSx3 element normalized RFC1 expression in iPSC neurons and rescued the DNA damage response, providing a framework for future therapeutic strategies. We also show that these biological findings are clinically relevant in heterozygous AAGGG expansion carriers, who display an increased risk and severity of neuropathy with platinum-based chemotherapy.",

      "title": "DNMT1 Coordinates PV Interneuron-Glia Coupling to Maintain Cortical Network Stability and Regulate Behavior",
      "content": "Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are central to cortical network stability and psychiatric vulnerability. Here, we identify DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as a key epigenetic regulator linking PV interneuron function to glial and extracellular matrix remodeling. Conditional PV-specific Dnmt1 deletion combined with single-cell RNA-seq, in vivo electrophysiology, histology, and behavioral analyses revealed that loss of DNMT1 increases PV spiking activity but reduces inhibitory efficacy, leading to network desynchronization and depression- and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These physiological alterations were accompanied by broad, non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in astrocytes and oligodendroglial populations, prominently affecting pathways involved in perineuronal-net (PNN) organization and neuron-glia communication. Cell-cell interaction analyses revealed disrupted NRXN-NLGN, TNR-integrin, and semaphoring signaling, consistent with weakened perisomatic adhesion and PNN integrity. Together, our findings demonstrate that DNMT1 maintains inhibitory circuit stability through cell-autonomous regulation of PV interneuron function, which secondarily shapes glial transcriptional states and extracellular scaffolds to preserve cortical network synchronization and emotional behavior.",

      "title": "Opioid receptor distribution in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform complex",
      "content": "The claustrum and dorsal endopiriform regions form a thin subcortical sheet reciprocally connected to the neocortex that is enriched in opioid receptors. The precise cellular distribution of opioid receptors within this region remains unclear. Using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) and hierarchical cluster analysis, we mapped the expression of mu (Oprm), delta (Oprd), kappa (Oprk), and ORL1 (Oprl) opioid receptor genes at single-cell resolution in the mouse claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. Among 2,269 neurons analyzed, six transcriptional clusters were identified: three excitatory (CLA, CLA/OPRK, cortical excitatory) and three inhibitory (SST, PVALB, broad inhibitory). Oprk expression was uniquely restricted to excitatory claustrum neurons and particularly enriched in the CLA/OPRK cluster which was comprised largely of Synpr+ claustrum core projection cells. In contrast, Oprd, Oprm, and Oprl genes were more broadly distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory populations, with Oprd enriched in parvalbumin (Pvalb) inhibitory neurons and Oprl in somatostatin (Sst) inhibitory neurons. Spatial mapping confirmed that Oprk expressing cells were concentrated within the claustrum core, whereas other receptor subtypes extended across the entire claustrum and into adjacent cortical regions. A comparable distribution of opioid receptors was observed in the neighbouring dorsal endopiriform. Analysis of a publicly available single cell sequencing dataset of the macaque claustrum also revealed a similar receptor distribution, where Oprk expression was enriched within a subset of excitatory projection neurons, and Oprm,Oprd, and Oprl expressed widely in both inhibitory and excitatory cells. Together, these findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved, cell-type-specific organization of opioid receptor expression in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. These results indicate that kappa opioid receptor expression is a defining molecular feature of excitatory claustrum projection neurons and suggest distinct roles for other opioid receptors in modulating inhibitory and cortical circuits.",
