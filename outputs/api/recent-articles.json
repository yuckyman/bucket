      "title": "Reduced belief updating impairs adaptive step initiation in older adults",
      "content": "Ageing is associated with declines in mobility and balance that threaten independence and increase the risk of falls. Although these changes are often attributed to deterioration of muscular and sensory systems, growing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in cognitive control also contribute to postural instability and gait impairments. Here, we examined whether shifts in cognitive control strategy underlie impaired gait initiation in older adults by modelling how individuals update beliefs about upcoming actions. Older and younger adults performed a choice-stepping go/no-go task in which the likelihood of initiating a step was manipulated across trials. We measured anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), the preparatory shifts in body weight that precede stepping, and modelled age-related differences in APA onset using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Older adults initiated APAs more slowly than younger adults, particularly following repeated go trials. Computational modelling revealed reduced learning rates and heightened sensitivity to uncertainty in older adults. These findings identify altered belief updating as a cognitive mechanism shaping age-related changes in adaptive stepping behaviour.",

      "content": "Astrocytes shape synapses and circuits, yet human basal ganglia astrocyte diversity is incompletely defined. We built a multimodal atlas by integrating single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility with DNA methylation, 3D chromatin conformation, and spatial transcriptomics, then mapped basal ganglia programs onto a whole-brain reference. Astrocytes segregated into three anatomical subgroups spanning striatal gray matter, extra-striatal gray matter, and white matter, with subgroup-biased neurotransmitter transporters and synapse-associated programs consistent with differences in dominant afferent input. Within striatum, dorsal and ventral astrocyte populations aligned with distinct microcircuits and were conserved in nonhuman primates. A deep learning sequence model identified subgroup-associated enhancer code and, when benchmarked against published enhancer-AAV datasets, supported the design of candidate viral tools to target basal ganglia astrocyte programs in vivo. Together, these data define major axes of human astrocyte specialization and provide a framework for cell type-specific dissection of basal ganglia function.",

      "title": "Characterization and application of hyperthermia-evoked seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia",
      "content": "Rodent models of drug-resistant epilepsy are widely used to uncover mechanisms of seizures and to test the efficacy of treatments; however, the stochastic and relatively infrequent nature of spontaneous seizures in these models makes it challenging to observe and manipulate peri-ictal activity, and to rapidly screen therapeutics. As fever has been identified as a clinical seizure trigger, we investigated the ability of induced hyperthermia to trigger seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a common cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Experimental mice were generated via in utero electroporation of a gain-of-function RHEB variant (RHEBp.P37L). In adult Rheb-FCD mice, hyperthermia elicited behavioral seizures ~80% of the time, with a mean temperature threshold of ~40 {degrees}C. Using this acute paradigm, as a proof-of-concept, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of a subset of excitatory neurons within the dysplasia significantly elevated the threshold for hyperthermia-evoked seizures. We then confirmed the relevance of this acute finding to spontaneous epileptiform activity, using repeated chemogenetic inhibition across chronic recordings to confirm a reduction of spontaneous seizures as well as interictal spikes. Overall, our data demonstrate that hyperthermia-evoked seizures can be readily elicited in Rheb-FCD mice, offering a tractable platform for evaluating therapeutic interventions targeting seizure susceptibility in focal epilepsy.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic Control of Retinal Oscillations Driving Infantile Nystagmus",
      "content": "Infantile nystagmus is a debilitating involuntary eye movement disorder often associated with retinal diseases such as Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB). The oscillating eye movements of infantile nystagmus come with reduced visual acuity, strongly impairing quality of life. No cure exists for this condition. Previously, we demonstrated that nystagmus in the CSNB mouse model Nyxnob has a retinal cause. Specifically, we found that synchronized oscillations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are transmitted to the accessory optic system, triggering compensatory eye movements. The RGC oscillations appear to originate from a specific retinal cell type, the AII amacrine cell (AII AC), making these cells the preferred target for treatment. Here we found that pharmacologically activating the dopaminergic input to AII ACs in Nyxnob mice completely suppresses the pathological oscillations of both AII ACs and RGCs and improves the signal fidelity of RGCs. Moreover, our retinal network simulations confirm that the experimentally observed changes to AII AC voltage-gated currents are sufficient to account for the dopamine-dependent abolishment of these oscillations. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic understanding of the retinal mechanism underlying infantile nystagmus as well as the associated low visual performance. Consequently, they offer the first pharmacological therapeutic strategy for this disorder.",

      "title": "Canonical cortical architecture supports the emergence of noise-invariant auditory representations",
      "content": "Neurons in the auditory system must represent behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise (BN) to support noise-invariant perception and behavior. Although primary auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in constructing noise-invariant representations, it remains unclear which excitatory subpopulations within ACtx carry out this transformation from noise-dependent to noise-invariant coding. To address this, we presented pure tones with and without continuous BN to head-fixed mice and used two-photon calcium imaging to record sound-evoked activity from three major excitatory subpopulations in ACtx: layer (L)2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, L5 IT neurons, and L5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. L2/3 IT neurons exhibited strong noise dependence at the level of single-neuron responses, pairwise interactions, and population representations. In contrast, deep-layer pathways showed greater noise invariance, with L5 IT neurons preserving stable representations most consistently and L5 ET neurons exhibiting more limited invariance at the population level. These findings reveal a functional division of labor in ACtx, in which superficial neurons remain noise-dependent and deep-layer broadcast pathways, particularly L5 IT, preferentially carry noise-invariant representations, suggesting that excitatory subpopulations contribute differentially to the construction and propagation of noise-invariant codes.",
