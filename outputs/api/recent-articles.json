      "title": "Intuitive knowledge of object acoustics enables perceptual separation of physical variables from impact sounds",
      "content": "Upon hearing objects collide, humans can estimate physical attributes such as material and mass. Although the physics of sound generation is well established, the inverse problem that listeners solve - of inferring physical parameters from sound - remains poorly understood. Classical accounts posit the use of acoustic cues that correlate with physical variables, but do not explain how humans might distinguish multiple concurrent physical causes. To study this problem, we built a probabilistic generative model of impact sounds, combining theoretical acoustics with statistics of object resonances measured from hundreds of everyday objects, and used it to synthesize and manipulate experimental stimuli. Humans accurately judged object properties from collision sounds. However, when both of the colliding objects varied, performance was impaired if the distribution of object resonances deviated from those measured in real-world objects. The results suggest that listeners use internal physical models to separate the acoustic contributions of objects in the world.",

      "title": "A Key Regulator of Dendritic Morphology in Supragranular Neocortex Impacts Mismatch Negativity",
      "content": "Background: Cytoskeletal structure and neuronal function are heavily intertwined, and altered pyramidal neuron morphology (e.g., reduced dendritic arbors) has been consistently identified in the neocortex of individuals with psychiatric disorders. A missense mutation in Kalrn (Kalrn-PT) enhances activation of RhoA, a cytoskeletal regulator, and leads to adolescent-onset dendritic regression in supragranular auditory cortex. To investigate the relationship between this spatiotemporally altered cytoskeletal structure and psychiatric-relevant dysfunction, we examine the functional impacts of this genetic mutation, focusing on mismatch negativity -- a common biomarker of altered sensory integration that matures across adolescence. Methods: In Kalrn-PT and littermate wild-type mice, pyramidal dendritic morphology was assessed across primary visual cortex (V1) layers using Golgi staining (n=172 neurons/26 mice). Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking were recorded during a visual oddball sequence (n=25 mice). Deviance detection -- the rodent neural analogue of mismatch negativity -- was analyzed across V1 layers. Results: Kalrn-PT mice exhibit reductions in V1 dendritic length specific to layer 2/3, mirroring observations in post-mortem samples from people with psychiatric disorders. Deviance detection was reduced in LFPs from Kalrn-PT mice and absent in layer 2/3 neurons, despite typical feature selectivity and firing rates. These deficits were accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between visual and frontal areas. Conclusions: These results highlight alterations in higher-level sensory cortical integration in Kalrn-PT mice and demonstrate that adolescent-onset, disease-relevant structural and functional phenotypes can be linked by a common upstream effector. Further, these alterations appear restricted to supragranular layers, demonstrating an outsized role for Kalrn, particularly longer isoforms, in superficial neocortex.",

      "title": "Subthreshold Kir and Ih currents modulate excitability of Layer 1 VIP interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Cortical layer 1 (L1) is a key site for integrating top-down and bottom-up information and is populated by inhibitory interneurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. These interneurons regulate information flow across the cortical column by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons, yet the subthreshold ionic mechanisms that shape their excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological properties of L1b VIP interneurons in mouse mPFC, focusing on the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir). Using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we find that L1b VIP interneurons exhibit constitutively active Ih and Kir conductances. Inhibition of Ih with ZD-7288 hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance (Rin), and prolonged action potential (AP) duration without altering rheobase or firing frequency, while increasing EPSP-spike coupling probability. Blocking Kir with BaCl2 depolarized the RMP, increased Rin and membrane time constant, reduced rheobase, increased firing frequency, and similarly enhanced EPSP-spike probability and AP duration. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed the presence of ZD-7288-sensitive Ih and BaCl2-sensitive Kir currents of small amplitude but operating on a high-resistance membrane, consistent with a strong impact on excitability. In contrast, neither Ih nor Kir inhibition affected the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, indicating that these currents do not measurably alter basal excitatory synaptic transmission. Immunofluorescence revealed weak somatic HCN1 and no detectable HCN2 expression in L1b VIP interneurons. Notably, Kir inhibition unmasked an Ih-dependent voltage sag during hyperpolarizing steps, suggesting that constitutive Kir activity normally masks Ih recruitment at subthreshold potentials. Together, these results indicate that Ih and Kir are active near RMP in L1b VIP interneurons and jointly regulate their passive properties, intrinsic excitability, and EPSP-spike coupling, therefore shaping how L1 VIP cells filter incoming signals and influence information flow within the prefrontal cortical column.",

      "title": "Semantic axes in the brain support analogical representations",
      "content": "In vectorial embeddings of word meaning, semantic features often reflect consistent directions, or axes, within a representational space. A classic example is gender: the vector spanning boy to girl can be added to the embedding for king to predict queen. Here we show that the same principle governs semantically driven neural responses in the human brain. We recorded single-neuron activity in three brain regions while participants listened to podcasts. Across fifteen analogical categories, including gender, number, and antonymy, we observed consistent vectorial directions, resulting in parallelogram structure within the neural manifold. Among pronouns, vectors corresponding to grammatical case, number, person, and possession obeyed the principle of commutativity, resulting in a prismatic structure, demonstrating that semantic axes can be factorized. We found parallelogram structure in all three regions, with some regional specialization: noun pluralization was more robust in the hippocampus than in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex, whereas verbal conjugation effects were more robust in the ACC. Finally, we found evidence for partial functional specialization at the neuron level: neurons most strongly involved in one analogy type were less involved in others. These principles parallel representational structure observed in large language models. Together, these findings support a geometric basis for analogical reasoning.",

      "content": "Congenital and early-life Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in neurologic deficits. Precise mechanisms of injury, especially in the more subtle presentation of postnatal infection, are not fully elucidated. Here, we defined the effects of ZIKV on the developing brain using single cell transcriptomics, histopathology and design-based stereology, diffusion MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments in infant rhesus macaques. ZIKV upregulated interferon-stimulated genes in activated microglia and cell death pathways in neurons and downregulated metabolism and differentiation genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Abnormal micro-organization of the corpus collosum and limbic white matter tracts was seen on diffusion weighted imaging. A curated gene set associated with autism spectrum disorder risk was negatively enriched in inhibitory and excitatory neurons from ZIKV-infected infants, with increased emotional reactivity already evident two weeks following infection. From single cells to organism-level behaviors, these results define the pathways and processes disrupted by early-life ZIKV infection.",

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "Accurate detection and segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a challenging task due to their small size, irregular shape, and variability in different imaging modalities. Precise segmentation of MS lesions from brain MRI is vital for early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment planning. We introduce MS-DASPNet, a Dual Attention Guided Deep Neural Network specifically designed to address the challenges of MS lesion detection, including small lesion sizes, low contrast, and heterogeneous appearance. MS-DASPNet employs a VGG-16-based encoder, an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) bottleneck for multi-scale context learning, and dual attention modules in each skip connection to simultaneously refine spatial details and enhance channel-wise feature representation. Evaluations on four publicly available datasets, namely ISBI-2015, Mendeley, MICCAI-2016, and MICCAI-2021, demonstrate that MS-DASPNet achieves superior Precision, Dice, Sensitivity, and Jaccard scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. MS-DASPNet attains a Dice score of 0.8736 on the MICCAI-2016 dataset and 0.8706 on the MICCAI-2021 dataset, both outperforming existing segmentation techniques, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in accurate MS lesion segmentation.",

      "content": "Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson\u2013Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (with low and high activity) and \u201cbroken symmetry\u201d phases. Symmetric phases are characterized by the same low or high activity in all the modules, while the broken symmetry phases are characterized by a high activity in a subset of the modules and low activity in the remaining ones. There are two lines of critical points, the first between the low activity symmetric phase and the high activity symmetric phase, and the second between the low activity symmetric phase and a broken symmetry phase with one active module. At those lines the system shows a critical behavior, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Avalanche shapes differ systematically along the two lines: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the transition with the symmetric phase, but become left-skewed over intermediate durations along critical line with the broken symmetry phase. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.",

      "title": "AI-driven audience clustering in sport media: a human\u2013computer interaction approach using \u2018CoPE-DEC\u2019",
      "content": "This study investigates the characteristics and underlying patterns of sports media audiences from a human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) perspective using artificial intelligence\u2013based deep learning analysis, with the aim of providing foundational data for the sports media industry. To this end, a novel unsupervised clustering framework, the Column-conditioned Prototype-Enhanced Deep Embedded Clustering (CoPE-DEC) technique, was employed to model and analyze multidimensional viewer experience data derived from sports media consumption contexts. The analysis identified three distinct audience clusters with differentiated behavioral, attitudinal, and value-oriented characteristics. The first cluster, labeled \u201cSports Value Orientation,\u201d was characterized by enhanced concentration during sports viewing, promotion of cooperative skills, motivation for health and exercise, vicarious satisfaction, aesthetic appreciation of sports movements, and admiration for athletes\u2019 professional and economic success. The second cluster, termed \u201cSports Consumption Culture Orientation,\u201d exhibited a strong preference for sports broadcasts over entertainment content, frequent consumption of online sports media, active engagement with preferred sports, participation in sports-related tourism and activities, acquisition of sports skills through media, and consumption of sports-related products. The third cluster, identified as \u201cSports Attitude Orientation,\u201d reflected predominantly social and emotional dimensions of sports viewing, including improved social adaptation, relationship formation, group cohesion, stress relief, psychological stabilization, healthy competitive attitudes, and enhanced overall wellbeing. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven deep learning approaches, particularly the CoPE-DEC framework, are effective in uncovering latent audience typologies and preference structures in sports media consumption environments. By integrating HCI principles with advanced clustering techniques, this study offers a methodological contribution to audience analysis research and provides practical implications for audience segmentation, personalized content design, and strategic decision-making in the sports media industry. Future research is encouraged to extend this approach by incorporating diverse AI methodologies and multimodal data sources to further advance interdisciplinary insights at the intersection of HCI, artificial intelligence, and sports media studies.",

      "title": "Lexicogrammatical profiling of ASD: cognitive-functional mapping and diagnostic implications",
      "content": "IntroductionPrevious corpus-based study first established an annotated dataset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) discourse, and subsequent modeling of lexicogrammatical patterns distinguished ASD from non-ASD discourse with high performance (accuracy 80%, precision 82%, sensitivity 73%, specificity 87%). That line of research further identified 46 statistically significant discriminators, of which 20 were analyzed in detail. The present study examines 18 additional discriminators and situates them within cognitive-functional domains to clarify their diagnostic relevance. Findings refine the language\u2013cognition interface in ASD and extend the utility of lexicogrammatical profiling for assessment.MethodsThe Tag Linear Model was employed to identify lexicogrammatical features that distinguish ASD and non-ASD discourse. Logistic regression with 10,000 bootstrap iterations was applied to establish statistical significance. Although DNN models yielded higher predictive accuracy, the linear model provided transparent identification of discriminators.ResultsOf the 135 items analyzed, 46 were confirmed as statistically significant discriminators (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Eighteen of these, not previously examined, were analyzed in the present study. The discriminators were mapped onto 12 cognitive-functional domains, including working memory, executive functioning, joint attention, predictive processing, and weak central coherence. The results reveal distinctive patterns across multiple domains, including reduced use of benefactive auxiliaries, relational attributive clauses, obligation modality, evaluative and gradational resources, and mimetic onomatopoeia, reflecting systematic constraints in abstraction, perspective-taking, and pragmatic orientation.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that choice patterns of lexicogrammar in ASD reflect domain-specific cognitive constraints. Interpreting the 18 discriminators within 12 cognitive-functional domains provides a linguistically grounded perspective on the neurocognitive profile of ASD and offers implications for future diagnostic and intervention research.",

      "title": "Motion feature extraction based on semi-supervised learning and long short-term memory network in digital dance",
      "content": "Digital-image technology has broadened the creative space of dance, yet accurately capturing the semantic correspondence between low-level motion data and high-level dance key-points remains challenging, especially when labeled data are scarce. We aim to establish a lightweight, semi-supervised pipeline that can extract discriminative motion features from depth sequences and map them to 3-D key-points of dancers in real time. To achieve pixel-level alignment between dance movement targets and high-dimensional sensory data, we propose a novel LSTM-CNN (Long Short Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network) framework. Temporal-context features are first extracted by LSTM, after which multi-dimensional spatial features are captured by three convolutional layers and one max-pooling layer; the fused representation is finally regressed to 3-D body key-points. To relieve class imbalance caused by complex postures, an online hard-example mining (OHEM) strategy together with a Dice-cross-entropy weighted loss (3:1) is embedded into semi-supervised learning, enabling the network to converge with only 20% labeled samples. Experiments on the public MSR-Action3D dataset (567 sequences, 20 actions) yielded an average recognition rate of 96.9%, surpassing the best comparison method (MSST) by 1.1%. On our self-established dataset (99 sequences, 11 actions) the accuracy reached 97.99% while training time was reduced by 35% compared with the previous best Multi_perspective_MHPCs approach. Both datasets show low RMSE (\u2264 0.032) between predicted and ground-truth key-points, confirming spatial precision. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reliably track subtle dance gestures under limited annotation, offering an efficient, low-cost solution for digital choreography, motion-style transfer and interactive stage performance.",

      "title": "Sympathetic signals beneath the surface: fresh insights from skin and muscle",
      "content": "The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, known for its governance of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, has attracted newfound interest due to its role in maintaining bodily homeostasis in various tissue types. Sympathetic activity in the skin is often perturbed in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, aberrant changes in the sympathetic skin response can be detected before clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy. Furthermore, sympathetic signaling at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle has now been demonstrated to be critical for synapse integrity and proper functioning. Insufficient sympathetic signaling in skeletal muscle underlies the pathogenesis of muscle weakness in several disease states, such as myasthenia syndromes and sarcopenia. Additionally, surgical sympathectomies, a treatment method for conditions that involve heightened sympathetic activity, can give rise to other unwanted side effects, prompting the need for sympathetic trunk reconstruction. Therefore, the sympathetic nervous system, with renewed appreciation of its known functions and developing excitement for its recently discovered functions, remains a source for a wealth of potential discoveries that can further enable us to improve human health.",
