      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

I mentioned it would be the foundation for a parametric node editor. Well, here it is!</p> <p>PyImageCUDA Studio is a node-based image compositor with GPU acceleration and headless Python automation. It lets you design image processing pipelines visually using 40+ nodes (generators, effects, filters, transforms), see results in real-time via CUDA-OpenGL preview, and then automate batch generation through a simple Python API.</p> <p>Demos:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0ab3da-d961-4587-a67c-7d290a008017\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0ab3da-d961-4587-a67c-7d290a008017</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c6a81d-5741-40e0-ad55-86a171a8aaa4\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c6a81d-5741-40e0-ad55-86a171a8aaa4</a></p> <p>The workflow: design your template in the GUI, save as <code>.pics</code> project, then generate thousands of variations programmatically: ```python from pyimagecuda_studio import LoadProject, set_node_parameter, run</p> <p>with LoadProject(&quot;certificate.pics&quot;): for name in [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;]: set_node_parameter(&quot;Text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, f&quot;Certificate for {name}&quot;) run(f&quot;certs/{name}.png&quot;) ```</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is for developers who need to generate image variations at scale (thumbnails, certificates, banners, watermarks), motion designers creating frame sequences, anyone applying filters to videos or creating animations programmatically, or those tired of slow CPU-based batch processing.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike Pillow/OpenCV (CPU-based, script-only) or Photoshop Actions (GUI-only, no real API), this combines visual design with programmatic control. It's not trying to replace Blender's compositor (which is more complex and 3D-focused) or ImageMagick (CLI-only). Instead, it fills the gap between visual tools and automation libraries\u2014providing both a node editor for design AND a clean Python API for batch processing, all GPU-accelerated (10-350x faster than CPU alternatives on complex operations).</p> <hr /> <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> - Built on PyImageCUDA (custom CUDA kernels, not wrappers) - PySide6 for GUI - PyOpenGL for real-time preview - PyVips for image I/O</p> <p><strong>Install:</strong> <code>bash pip install pyimagecuda-studio </code></p> <p><strong>Run:</strong> ```bash pics</p> <h1>or</h1> <p>pyimagecuda-studio ```</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda-studio\">https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda-studio</a> - PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyimagecuda-studio/\">https://pypi.org/project/pyimagecuda-studio/</a> - Core library: <a href=\"https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda\">https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda</a> - Performance benchmarks: <a href=\"https://offerrall.github.io/pyimagecuda/benchmarks/\">https://offerrall.github.io/pyimagecuda/benchmarks/</a></p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Python 3.10+, NVIDIA GPU (GTX 900+), Windows/Linux.
