      "content": "Despite extensive investigation on the use of electromyographic (EMG) activity to control active exoskeletons over the past decade, designing intuitive assistive controllers that seamlessly integrate with natural human motor control have yet to be realized. While existing EMG-based controllers often achieve substantial reduction in muscle effort, they frequently incur increased cognitive and attentional load for the user, thereby compromising the overall efficacy of the assistance. Here we introduce a novel EMG-based assistive controller founded upon neuroscience principles, specifically the observation that humans naturally exploit gravity torque to facilitate movement control. Therefore, deviating from conventional compensation strategies, our approach purposely leaves a fraction of the predicted human gravity torque uncompensated so that users can still take advantage of gravity as they would without assistance. Through a load-carrying arm movement task, we show that enabling gravity exploitation improves traditional EMG-based assistance by achieving a significant reduction in muscle effort, while concurrently yielding superior kinematic performance (i.e., faster, smoother movements) and enhanced subjective user experience. These findings demonstrate that integrating principles from neural motor control into assistive controllers allows to implement a favorable tradeoff between muscle effort reduction and functional usability.",

      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",
