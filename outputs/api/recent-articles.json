      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Deletion of Cacna1c (CaV1.2) in D1-expressing cells elicits divergent sex-specific effects on aversive and spatial memories",
      "content": "Dopamine signaling is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. One downstream effector of dopamine is the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, encoded by the risk gene CACNA1C. Genome-wide association studies have consistently linked CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphisms to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related conditions. We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory. In males, homozygous loss of D1-Cacna1c heightens remote contextual fear at 30-days post-training, replicating prior findings, whereas partial loss had no effect. Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females. In the Water Y-maze, males with heterozygous or homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss showed impaired spatial memory at 7-days post-training, whereas females were unaffected. D1-Cacna1c deletion reduced locomotor activity selectively in females during the initial 5-mins of a 60-min session, with no genotype effects in males. Social interaction and anxiety-like behavior were unchanged across groups. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between dopamine receptor signaling and calcium channel function in shaping sex-dependent aspects of memory.",

      "title": "Tuned to explore: Increased phasic responses to auditory targets and novelty in children regardless of induced tonic arousal",
      "content": "The ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions is critical during childhood, as it supports learning, social interaction, and adaptation to changing environments. This attentional balance is thought to depend in part on arousal regulation, mediated by the activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal. These findings show developmental differences in physiological responses to unexpected environmental stimuli and provide physiological evidence of increased distractibility during childhood.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
