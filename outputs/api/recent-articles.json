      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",
