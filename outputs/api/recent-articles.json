      "title": "Co-Designing Research Priorities in Developmental Neuroscience: A Community-Based Participatory Approach",
      "content": "Children and adolescents, the primary participants in developmental neuroscience research, are rarely consulted or included in the research design process. By neglecting their perspectives and needs, we risk limiting the relevance and effectiveness of translational research that might emerge from such research. Here, we report on a process of co-development with adolescents in the UK city of Bradford to inform the generation of a new developmental neuroimaging research programme. We employed a two-study community-based participatory approach and used mixed methods to identify the research priorities of this community. In the first study, 79 secondary school students from four schools were introduced to fundamental neuroscience concepts during five one-hour workshops. In groups, they then designed research studies, centred around topics they deemed imported, and were asked to present their ideas on posters, role playing as neuroscientists. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on these posters, extracting ten key themes. In the second study, 387 students from four schools ranked the ten extracted themes in order of importance. Mental health and stress consistently emerged as the highest priorities across groups. Exploratory analysis revealed that the priority for themes exploring healthy routines and understanding anti-social behaviours varied across schools and the importance of mental health, and topics related to video gaming varied significantly between genders. This work provides an illustration of how a place-based participatory approach can inform the design of developmental neuroscience programmes, improving both equity and translational relevance.",

      "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Human Neocortical Glutamatergic Neurons Revealed Through Multimodal Profiling",
      "content": "The human neocortex underlies higher cognition and is the engine of complex thought. Yet our understanding of its neuronal diversity is limited by sparse access to tissue, inconsistent sampling across studies, and a lack of multiple modality data. Although single-cell transcriptomic taxonomies are an important framework for characterizing cell type diversity, transcriptomic information alone cannot reveal the cellular properties that define neuronal computations. To address this, we performed Patch-seq, a method for collecting Morphology, Electrophysiology, and Transcriptomic data from a single neuron. We focused on glutamatergic, neocortical, excitatory neurons, the principal long-range projecting neurons of the cortex, and systematically integrated their morphoelectric features with transcriptomic identity. In combination with spatial transcriptomic data, we interrogated 39 of 42 transcriptomically-defined neuron types with a layer-centric perspective. Morphoelectric properties, such as cortical depth, apical dendrite structure, and excitability clearly distinguish transcriptomic subclasses and support many finer transcriptomic types. Morphoelectric properties are influenced by spatial location in supragranular layers, while deeper layers exhibit greater heterogeneity. Cross-species comparisons reveal conserved subclass organization but pronounced differences in apical dendrite arborization between mouse and human, and surprising similarities between human and macaque. Together, these datasets provide a unified multimodal reference that advances our understanding of human cortical circuitry and establishes a foundation for experimental and computational studies of human brain function and disease.",

      "title": "Emergent Traveling Waves in Neural Circuits",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks achieve striking performance but do not capture a prominent neural property. Cortical activity is organized by structured spatiotemporal dynamics, traveling waves (TW), which have been implicated in a wide range of functions. Existing computational models often rely on hand-crafted connectivity and imposed dynamics, offering insight into their impact but less into how the waves naturally emerge in biological circuits. Here, we found that TWs emerge in models under biologically plausible constraints (spatially organized, directionally biased connectivity). Under an empirical neural manifold constraint, these wiring principles naturally emerge to support traveling wave dynamics in the recurrent model. We further show that wave propagation provides a robust mechanism for maintaining working memory in the presence of visual distractors. We compared these model predictions to non-human primate prefrontal cortex recordings, revealing a similar mechanism. Together, these results advance our understanding of traveling waves as a substrate for cognition and offer a framework for mechanistic accounts of cortical computation.",

      "title": "Genetics-informed bidirectional mapping of glycemic traits and brain phenotypes",
      "content": "Dysglycaemia is linked to brain atrophy, white-matter disruption and dementia risk, yet the directionality and mechanisms of glycemic-brain coupling remain unclear. Here we integrate large-scale GWAS of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes with multimodal brain imaging phenotypes and major brain disorders using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization. Across 4,040 tests, we identify 54 glycaemia and brain causal associations (FDR P < 0.05) and uncover a timescale-dependent hierarchy: short-term glycemic traits map to distributed macrostructure and functional-network, whereas long-term glycemic burden preferentially implicates long-range association and commissural white-matter pathways with focal prefrontal-paracentral vulnerability. Reverse analyses reveal 44 brain IDPs and glycaemia effects. Multi-trait Bayesian colocalization and tissue/cell type eQTL integration nominate shared causal loci enriched in glial and neurovascular pathways. Individual-level UK Biobank analyses validated glycaemia-associated brain structural alterations and non-linear risk patterns for incident outcomes. Together, our results provide a genetically anchored atlas of bidirectional glycemic-neural relationships, linking metabolic dysregulation to multiscale brain vulnerability and disorder risk.",

      "title": "Cognitive and emotional responses to viewing mummies in an Egyptian museum",
      "content": "IntroductionA recent subfield of neuropsychology is the study of people\u2019s reactions to visiting a museum and observing artworks. However, museums do not only contain artworks or archeological finds, and some of them exhibit human remains, such as mummies. A growing debate concerns the ethical issues of such exhibitions, but the psychological and physiological reactions of visitors when viewing mummies have not yet been measured.MethodsIn this study, 33 subjects (40.3 \u00b1 14.4 years old) participated in two experiments conducted at the Egyptian Museum of Turin (Italy). In the first experiment, they were asked to observe an empty sarcophagus, an opened sarcophagus with a mummy inside, and an open sarcophagus with the mummy placed between the cover and the coffin of the sarcophagus. Subjects wore an electroencephalographic (EEG) system on their heads, electrodes on their fingers to measure skin conductance levels (SCL) and wore eye-tracking glasses. In the second experiment, they visited the room of the \u201cThree Sisters\u201d with two completely bandaged mummies and one partially unbandaged. The indices extracted from EEG and SCL signals were compared before and after they noticed the partially unbandaged mummy.ResultsCognitive workload was found to increase due to the presence of the mummies in the first experiment, whereas an increase in emotional arousal (SCL) was observed in the second experiment after participants saw that partially unbandaged mummy.DiscussionThe presence of mummies increased the emotional engagement, but it was not an effect specific leading to negative emotions.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",
