      "title": "Developmental changes in the morphology and three-dimensional arrangement of antennal hair plates in crickets",
      "content": "Antennae of insects are essential mechanosensory organs that facilitate active tactile exploration and spatial navigation. Hair-plate sensilla at the base of the antenna flagellum provide proprioceptive inputs to detect their position. In hemimetabolous insects, such as crickets, the first instar immediately after hatching also possesses antennae, but the developmental dynamics and spatial organization of antennal hair plates remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis of the antennal hair plates in crickets across developmental stages, from the first instar to adulthood. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we demonstrated that hair plate sensilla were present from the first instars and maintained a highly stereotyped spatial arrangement throughout development. Three-dimensional quantification revealed that new sensilla added during molting were formed at specific sites within the hair plate clusters that had existed at the previous stage, maintaining the spatial pattern despite the substantial growth of the antenna. Multidimensional analyses indicated that the spatial arrangement of sensilla was consistent across individuals, suggesting that organization was genetically determined. Retrograde labeling of sensory afferents showed that sensory neurons in the hair plates converged their axons, extended axon collaterals into the ipsilateral region of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, and ultimately projected to the subesophageal ganglion. There was no apparent difference in their projection site among hair plates, suggesting no evidence of topographic organization. Our findings highlight the conserved spatial organization of hair-plate sensilla in crickets, suggesting a robust proprioceptive system that provides reliable feedback of antennal position throughout development.",

      "title": "Temporal Dynamics of High-Frequency Oscillations in Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Study in hAPP-J20 Mice",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and increased seizure susceptibility; yet both the mechanistic and temporal links between AD and epileptogenesis remain poorly defined. In this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of epileptogenesis in relation to AD pathology using hAPP-J20 transgenic mice aged 9 to 27 weeks, encompassing the AD conversion phase. Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) was employed to monitor hippocampal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), including ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-600 Hz), in conjunction with histological, behavioral, and neurophysiological assessments to characterize underlying neural circuit alterations. We identified three distinct epileptogenic stages in transgenic mice: (1) 9-15 weeks: emerging memory deficits, increased excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuron ratio, mossy fiber sprouting, and peak seizure-related mortality, alongside the initial emergence of pathological HFOs; (2) 15-21 weeks: a pronounced escalation of pathological HFO activity and persistent network hyperexcitability preceding detectable amyloid plaque deposition, indicating rapid epileptogenic progression; (3) 21-27 weeks: stabilization of HFO activity despite continued progression of amyloid accumulation, suggesting a plateau in epileptogenic remodeling amid advancing Alzheimer's pathology. These findings indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability precedes amyloid plaque deposition and likely contributes to disease progression, highlighting a critical early window for therapeutic intervention in AD. Moreover, pathological HFOs hold promise as electrophysiological biomarkers of early circuit dysfunction and represent a promising target for modifying the course of AD.",

      "title": "Proficiency-Dependent and Dynamic Reorganization of Brain Networks During Children's Second Language Learning",
      "content": "Children's second language (L2) vocabulary learning is often indexed with event-related potentials (ERPs) by the N400 incongruity effect, yet its stability in real classrooms is unclear. We recorded 64-channel EEG from 42 children (aged 9-15 years) during a translation-recognition task before and after a regular instructional vocabulary unit and sub-grouped children by baseline proficiency. We quantified the canonical N400 (300-500 ms, centroparietal region of interest; ROI) alongside electrical-neuroimaging indices of ERP strength and topography (Global Field Power, Global Map Dissimilarity, ERP template-map preponderance), using adult template maps from a prior study as a normative reference. Behaviorally, children showed large gains in vocabulary accuracy and higher discrimination sensitivity (d') in post-assessment. The classical N400 incongruity effect did not increase from pre- to post-learning. By contrast, global and topographic measures were learning-sensitive: Global Field Power increased across sessions and interacted with proficiency, and Global Map Dissimilarity showed main effects of session and proficiency as well as their interaction, indicating proficiency-dependent topographic reorganization. Adult normative template maps backfitted well; within the N400 window, high-proficiency children more consistently occupied an adult-like configuration; later (~650-800 ms), patterns also differentiated by proficiency and congruency. Relative to adults, children exhibited more diffuse topographies and stronger dependence on individual proficiency. In classroom settings, children's L2 vocabulary learning is therefore more sensitively indexed by scalp topography and global field dynamics than by a single N400 amplitude, positioning electrical neuroimaging as a proficiency-dependent, classroom-relevant marker of L2 acquisition.",

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

      "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "title": "Chemogenetic modulation of PAC1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) alters anxiety-related behaviors in male mice.",
      "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

      "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

      "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

      "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.
