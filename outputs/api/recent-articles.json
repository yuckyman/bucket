      "title": "Energetic implications of fMRI-based nodal complex network metrics: a complex picture unfolds across diverse brain states",
      "content": "Functional MRI-based graph theory has provided profound insights into the brain's functional organization, yet the neuroenergetic meaning of widely used graph-theoretical metrics remains poorly understood. Although resting-state research suggests a positive coupling between network topology and glucose metabolism, it remains unclear whether this relationship reflects a general principle of brain organization or a state-specific phenomenon. Here, we test the neuroenergetic interpretability of nodal graph-theoretical metrics by linking complex network topology to cerebral glucose consumption across diverse brain states. Leveraging simultaneous functional PET-MRI, we directly compare state-dependent fluctuations in glucose consumption and network topology during sensory, cognitive, and arousal conditions. We further assess metabolic-topological couplings in disease through a meta-analysis of resting-state FDG-PET and fMRI studies involving Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Our results show that nodal graph-theoretical metrics exhibit state- and network-dependent metabolic associations, with coupling patterns diverging across experimental and disease contexts. Notably, frontoparietal and attentional networks show more conserved metabolic-topological coupling than other large-scale networks across states. These findings underscore a dynamic, complex interplay between metabolic demand and complex network organization, highlighting the need for a nuanced interpretation of the energetic underpinnings of nodal graph-theoretical metrics in health and disease.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",
