      "title": "Chronic oral cannabidiol delays or prevents seizures in a mouse model of CLN2 disease",
      "content": "A growing body of literature describes the anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-epileptic properties of the cannabis sativa constituent cannabidiol, suggesting that it might play a useful role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder resulting from an inherited dysfunction of the lysosome. CLN2 disease, and its representative animal models, display neuroimmune response, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and epileptic seizures, and these symptoms are all touted as potential targets of cannabidiol therapeutic benefit. Here, we treated a valid model of CLN2 disease with long-term daily cannabidiol (300mg/kg) from 1 month of age until disease end stage and evaluated epileptic seizures, lifespan, and markers of neuroimmune response. Chronic cannabidiol treatment significantly delayed or fully eliminated seizures in CLN2 mice compared to those treated with vehicle only, and the treatment led to a nearly significant extension of lifespan. These effects occurred in the absence of any therapeutic benefit to physiological markers of disease such as GFAP, CD68, and cytokine/chemokine reactivity. Taken together, we show that chronic treatment with cannabidiol confers significant anti-seizure benefit to the mouse model of CLN2 disease, and that it does not appear to do so by altering the inflammatory and neuroimmune markers traditionally used to track CLN2 disease progression.",

      "title": "Differential regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates in neurons versus astrocytes during cellular stress",
      "content": "Sequestosome 1/p62 (hereafter referred to as p62) is a multifunctional protein that orchestrates various cellular stress response pathways including autophagy, proteasome-mediated degradation, antioxidant defense, nutrient sensing, and inflammatory signaling. Mutations in distinct functional domains of p62 are linked with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in neural cells. Neurons and astrocytes perform distinct roles in brain physiology and thus encounter a unique landscape of cellular stress. However, how p62 is regulated in these cell types in response to various stress modalities remains largely unexplored. Several functions for p62 depend on engagement with ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, we investigated how the regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates differs between neurons and astrocytes exposed to two stress modalities: lysosomal membrane damage and metabolic stress. Lysosomal damage triggered ubiquitin-dependent assembly of p62 puncta in both neurons and astrocytes. In contrast, nutrient deprivation elicited different responses between neurons and astrocytes. Neurons formed p62-ubiquitin structures more prominently and displayed a greater dependence on ubiquitin for p62 clustering. Together, these findings reveal cell-type-specific and stress-specific regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that neurons and astrocytes can deploy distinct quality control strategies.",

      "title": "Methamphetamine Conditioned Place Preference in Adolescent Mice: Interaction Between Sex and Strain",
      "content": "Background: Methamphetamine (METH) use is higher in adolescent women than men. While rodent studies support a sex difference in the reinforcing effects of METH, few have investigated sex differences in the underlying neural circuits, none of which tested rodents during adolescence. Aims: Investigate whether there are sex differences in the rewarding effects of METH in two strains of adolescent mice that are commonly used to generate transgenic lines. Identify changes in associated neural circuits. Methods: We tested METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female 129Sv/Ev and C57Bl/6 mice during middle adolescence using 1mg/kg of METH. Behaviorally-induced upregulation of c-Fos protein expression was quantified in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and area CA1 of the hippocampus following the post-conditioning test. Results: In C57Bl/6 mice, METH induced CPP in females, but not males. Conversely, METH-induced CPP in 129Sv/Ev males, but not females. In both strains, groups that exhibited CPP had more c-Fos+ cells in the NAc and CA1 when compared to saline-treated control groups. The number of c-Fos+ cells in these two brain regions correlated in groups exhibiting CPP, indicating increased NAc-CA1 communication during retrieval of the conditioned memory. Finally, we found evidence of behavioral sensitization in 129Sv/Ev males only. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the rewarding effects of the METH in adolescent mice are both sex- and strain-dependent, indicating that METH response may result from an interaction between sex-specific and genetic mechanisms. Our findings will be informative when selecting an appropriate background strain in future studies using genetically modified mice.",

      "title": "Opposite and complementary roles of the two calcium thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD in models of striatal projection neurons",
      "content": "Synaptic plasticity has been shown to occur when calcium, flowing into the synapse due to incoming stimuli, surpasses a threshold level. This threshold level is modifiable through a process called metaplasticity. Some neurons, such as the striatal projection neurons, use different sources of calcium as the signal for synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakening (long-term depression, LTD), resulting in them having two thresholds for inducing plasticity. In this study, we show opposite and complementary roles of metaplasticity in these two thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD on learning how to solve the linear and nonlinear feature binding problem (FBP and NFBP). In short, metaplasticity in one threshold (e.g. LTD) allows synaptic plasticity of the opposite type (e.g. LTP) to be properly expressed. This happens because metaplasticity in the LTD threshold protects strengthened synapses from weakening, thus allowing them to persistently increase during learning (and encode learned patterns). Similarly, metaplasticity in the LTP threhsold prevents weakened synapses from strengthening, thus allowing them to persistently decrease. Metaplasticity in both thresholds is necessary when synapses are clustered and the neuron needs to rely on supralinear dendritic integration for learning.",
