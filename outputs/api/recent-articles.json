      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "Hyperthermic Seizure Susceptibility and Focal Decreases in Parvalbumin-Expressing Cortical Interneurons in a Mouse Model of PCDH19-Clustering Epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective: Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19)-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is a severe genetic epilepsy that manifests with early-onset cluster seizures often triggered by fever, intellectual disability, autistic features, and later neuropsychiatric risk. PCDH19 is an X-linked gene critical for brain development. PCE predominantly affects females and rare mosaic males, but not hemizygous males, likely due to cellular mosaicism arising from random X-inactivation and resultant segregation of wild-type and mutant neurons (so-called cellular interference) during development. We generated a novel PCE mouse model and explored neuronal segregation, seizure susceptibility and cortical interneuron distributions. Methods: Female Pcdh19+/- mice were crossed with X-GFP males to visualize random X-inactivation patterns. Seizure susceptibility was assessed in juvenile mice using hyperthermia and flurothyl exposure. Behavioral testing evaluated cognitive domains. Interneuron distribution in hippocampus and cortex was examined histologically by immunolabeling and crosses with parvalbumin reporter mice. Results: Juvenile Pcdh19+/- females lacked spontaneous seizures but displayed lower seizure thresholds and more severe seizures during hyperthermia. Seizure susceptibility did not differ from controls after flurothyl exposure. Pcdh19+/- females also exhibited segregation of GFP+ cells in the cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and medial ganglionic eminence, with a marked reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal region. Although parvalbumin interneuron density was unchanged in the Pcdh19+/- female cortex overall, localized decreases arose in GFP- (Pcdh19 knockout) cortical stripes. Interpretation: Juvenile PCE mice exhibit seizure susceptibility to hyperthermia and disrupted the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings suggest focal parvalbumin interneuron alterations may contribute to PCE pathophysiology.",

      "title": "DTI-ALPS PRIMARILY REFLECTS WHITE MATTER DIFFUSION DISPERSION AND MICROSTRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY IN NEURODEGENERATION: INSIGHTS FROM MULTI-MODAL MRI",
      "content": "1.1 Background The glymphatic system facilitates clearance of metabolic waste and pathological proteins from the brain, and its dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a non-invasive MRI marker of glymphatic flow, although its biological specificity remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the determinants of DTI-ALPS and evaluate whether it primarily reflects white matter (WM) microstructure rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration. 1.2 Methods We examined 100 individuals referred to the Memory Clinic of the Policlinico Hospital in Milan for suspected dementia. All participants underwent a 3T-MRI protocol including 3D-T1-weighted and 3D-FLAIR imaging, double-shell diffusion-weighted imaging (b=1000/2000 s/mm2), and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences for quantitative susceptibility mapping. Within standard DTI-ALPS ROIs, we extracted DTI-ALPS values together with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MA) at both b-values, as well as neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, particularly the orientation dispersion index (ODI). WM microstructure was further characterized using the T1/FLAIR ratio and diamagnetic component of susceptibility (DCS). 1.3 Results and conclusions DTI-ALPS correlated inversely with MA (r = -0.84 at b = 1000; r = -0.86 at b = 2000) and positively with ODI (r = 0.73). Moderate correlations with the T1/FLAIR ratio and DCS supported sensitivity to WM alterations. Factor analysis indicated that DTI-ALPS clustered with MA and ODI rather than forming a distinct factor, suggesting that DTI-ALPS primarily reflects WM diffusion dispersion and heterogeneity rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration.",
