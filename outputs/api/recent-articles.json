      "title": "Show HN: An LLM response cache that's aware of dynamic data",
      "content": "<p>Raymond here from Butter.dev, an LLM response cache built as a chat-completions proxy. Today we're launching a key feature for the platform: the ability to generalize on dynamic, templated inputs.<p>Caching at the HTTP request level has the obvious problem of generalizability. Nearly no request is identical, due to templated variables (like names) and metadata (like timestamps), so exact-match cache lookups rarely hit. We solve this at Butter by using LLMs to detect dynamic content in requests and derive their inter-relationships, allowing the cache entry to be stored as a template + variables + deterministic code. This allows future requests to contain different variable data, yet still serve from cache.<p>We've found this approach greatly improves cache hit rate, and believe it could be useful for agents performing repetitive back-office tasks, computer use, or data transformations where input data is frequently of the same shape.<p>- You can see a demo of learning patterns here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA</a><p>- We wrote more about the technical approach here: <a href=\"https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-response-caching\">https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-...</a><p>- It's free to try out here: <a href=\"https://butter.dev/auth\">https://butter.dev/auth</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Noradrenergic infraslow rhythm during sleep is the critical link between heart-rate dynamics and memory consolidation",
      "content": "Recent work shows that the brains arousal system remains active during sleep, with rhythmic locus coeruleus (LC) activity shaping sleep architecture and supporting memory consolidation. The LC releases norepinephrine (NE) in infraslow (~0.02 Hz) bouts that gate NREM sleep spindles. Here, we demonstrate that heart rate (HR) fluctuations during NREM are tightly phase-locked to these NE rhythms, identifying the LC as a key driver of very-low-frequency HR variability (VLF-HRV), an understudied autonomic signal. Using optogenetics, transient LC inhibition blunts HR slowing, whereas LC activation produces rapid HR acceleration, directly linking LC output to cardiac control during sleep. We further show that infraslow HR variability is a cross-species marker of spindle-dependent memory processing. In mice, the amplitude of HR decelerations during NREM predicts spindle activity and subsequent memory performance. Remarkably, human sleepers show the same pattern: stronger VLF-HR fluctuations during NREM correspond to increased spindle expression and better overnight memory retention. These findings reveal a mechanistic pathway through which LC activity modulates autonomic physiology during sleep and identify infraslow HR variability as a non-invasive marker of brainstem function and memory-promoting sleep. Because LC degeneration occurs early in neurodegenerative disease, sleep-derived HR metrics may provide a scalable indicator of emerging neuromodulatory dysfunction.",

      "title": "The fluctuations of alpha power: bimodalities, connectivity, and neural mass models",
      "content": "The alpha rhythm is a hallmark of electrophysiological resting-state brain activity, that serves as a biomarker in health and disease. Alpha power is far from uniform over time, exhibiting dynamic fluctuations. The likelihood of those power values can be captured by a decreasing exponential function, that in certain cases becomes bimodal. While alpha rhythm is usually evaluated through the averaged power spectra across entire recordings, its dynamic fluctuations have received less attention. In this study, we investigate the dynamic nature of alpha power, its relationship with functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), and the ability of the Jansen-Rit (JR) neural mass model to replicate these fluctuations. Using MRI and MEG data from 42 participants in resting state with eyes-closed and eyes-open, we evaluated the shape of the exponential distributions for alpha power fluctuations, and their relationship with other spectral variables as frequency, power and the aperiodic exponent. Additionally, we assessed the temporal relationship between alpha power and FC using phase-based (ciPLV) and amplitude-based (cAEC) metrics. Finally, we employed diffusion-weighted MRI to construct brain network models incorporating JR neural masses to reproduce and characterize alpha fluctuations. Our results indicate that alpha power predominantly follows unimodal exponential distributions, with bimodalities associated to high-power in posterior regions. FC analyses revealed that ciPLV and cAEC were directly correlated with alpha power within the DMN in alpha and beta bands, whereas only theta-band ciPLV showed an inverse relationship with alpha power. JR model simulations suggested that post- supercritical fixed points better replicated alpha power fluctuations compared to limit cycle parameterizations and pre- saddle node fixed points. These results deepen our understanding of the dynamics of alpha rhythm and its intricate relationship with FC patterns, offering novel insights to refine biologically plausible brain simulations and advance computational models of neural dynamics.",

      "title": "SSAO-mediated decrease of endothelial BDNF release affects neuronal GluA1 and PSD95 expression: a peripheral mechanism inducing NVU and CNS disturbances",
      "content": "Dysfunction of the vascular system contributes to brain damage and neurodegeneration, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) can be identified in a high percentage of Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations can affect communication and signalling between neurovascular unit (NVU) components through changes in the release of angioneurins, among others. The two-hit vascular hypothesis of AD suggests that chronic vascular risk factors cause an early damage to the brain microvasculature (hit 1) triggering a cascade of events that leads to amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation in the brain and precipitating the A\u03b2-dependent pathway of neurodegeneration (hit 2). The vascular enzyme and adhesion molecule SSAO/VAP-1 plays an important role in cerebrovascular dysfunction and vascular A\u03b2 aggregation, acting as an active player in the first of the two-hits. We generated a new NVU in vitro model to study the role of SSAO/VAP-1 on the BBB dysfunction and its effects on neurons in an AD context. We focused on the release of key angioneurins for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, highly compromised in AD. Our results show that SSAO/VAP-1 expression, together with the addition of A\u03b21-40peptide containing the Dutch mutation (used to mimic CAA condition; A\u03b2D), to cerebral endothelial cells synergistically alter the release of vascular BDNF. This alteration subsequently affects the expression of synaptic markers PSD95 and GluA1 in cortical neurons. Moreover, GluA1 and PSD95-positive neurons present reduced immunolabeling intensity of these markers when low levels of vascular BDNF are present. These results reveal vascular BDNF as a possible key element in the sensitization to A\u03b2 due to SSAO/VAP-1 expression, impacting negatively on glutamatergic synaptic and NVU function.HighlightsSSAO/VAP-1 expression alters BBB decreasing ZO-1, VE-Cadherin and Claudin-5 levels.SSAO/VAP-1 expression alters the release of vascular angioneurin BDNF.SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D decrease synaptic protein levels affecting glutamatergic neurons.Endothelial BDNF decrease induced by SSAO/VAP-1 and A\u03b2D alters glutamatergic neurons.",

      "title": "Acetaminophen inhibits diacylglycerol lipase synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol: implications for nociception",
      "content": "SUMMARYThough acetaminophen is a ubiquitous analgesic, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Thus, even though acetaminophen causes \u223c500 deaths each year in the US it has not been possible to design safer alternatives. Because endocannabinoids may have a role in acetaminophen action, we examined interactions between the two. We now report that acetaminophen inhibits the activity of diacylglycerol lipase \u03b1 (DAGL\u03b1), but not DAGL\u03b2, decreasing production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. This gave rise to the counterintuitive hypothesis that decreasing endocannabinoid production by DAGL\u03b1inhibitionmay be antinociceptive in certain settings. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that DAGL inhibition by RHC80267 is antinociceptive in wildtype but not CB1 knockout mice in the hotplate test. We propose 1) that activation of DAGL\u03b1 may exacerbate some forms of nociception and 2) a novel mechanism for the antinociceptive actions of acetaminophen whereby acetaminophen inhibits a DAGL\u03b1/CB1-based circuit that plays a permissive role in at least one form of nociception.",

      "title": "Predictive processing in the cortical network of biological motion perception: An fMRI-DCM study",
      "content": "Biological motion perception (BMP) is fundamental for interpreting and predicting human actions, playing a crucial role in social cognition. While traditionally viewed as a bottom-up process, recent evidence suggests that top-down mechanisms, particularly expectations, influence BMP. This fMRI study investigates how prior expectations shape BMP by employing a predictive cueing paradigm. Participants discriminated between biological and scrambled motion while presented with congruent, incongruent, or uninformative cues. Behavioral results revealed that correct expectations facilitated performance, while incorrect expectations impaired it. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) analysis demonstrated bidirectional connectivity within the action observation network (AON), particularly between the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) under all expectation conditions. Additionally, Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) confirmed the involvement of these regions in BMP. These findings challenge traditional bottom-up models by highlighting the role of predictive processes in action perception and provide evidence for expectation-dependent modulation of AON connectivity.",

      "title": "Physical Activity and Depressive Mood Shared the Structural Connectivity between Motor and Reward Network: a population-based study from the UK Biobank",
      "content": "BackgroundExercise has been revealed to leave a positive effect on alleviating depressive symptoms by various existing studies. However, the neural basis behind this phenomenon remains unknown, as well as its underlying biological mechanism.AimsUsing a large neuroimaging cohort from UK Biobank, this study aimed to identify structural connectivity (SC) patterns simultaneously linked with physical activity and depression, as well as its biological interpretation.Method492 participants with major depression disorder (MDD) and 535 healthy controls (HC) were extracted from the UK Biobank dataset. Partial least squares regression was first utilized to explore a replicable SC pattern simultaneously associated with physical activity and depressive mood. The neuromaps toolbox was applied to interpret the biological ontologies of the identified SC pattern. Neuroimaging-transcriptome association and enrichment analyses were conducted to explore its underlying genetic basis, pathways and cell types. The reproducibility and generalizability were tested on another independent MDD dataset (N=3,496) and bipolar disorder (BD) dataset (N=81).ResultsA SC pattern linked with exercise was identified to be both significantly correlated with depressive mood and group discriminative between MDDs and HCs, which primarily located between the motor-related regions and reward-related regions. This pattern was associated with multiple neurotransmitter receptors, such as serotonin and GABA receptors, and enriched in pathways like synaptic signaling and astrocytes cell type. The SC pattern and genetic results were also replicated in another independent MDD dataset and present commonalities with BD.ConclusionsThis study not only initially identified a reproducible shared SC pattern between physical activity and depressive mood, but also elucidated the underlying biological mechanisms, which enhanced our understanding of how exercise helps alleviate depression and may inform the development of novel neuromodulation targets.",
