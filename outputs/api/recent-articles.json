      "title": "Learning discrete neural latent spaces for high-performance speech decoding",
      "content": "Objective. Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which directly transform neural signals into intelligible voices, offer a promising avenue for people with aphasia. To decode speech information from brain signals, neural representation learning plays an important role. Approach. Existing studies mainly explored continuous neural latent spaces for speech decoding and ignored the intrinsic discrete property in speech production. Here, we propose to learn a discrete neural latent space by constructing a quantized representation learning network for speech decoding. Main results. Experiments with intracranial stereotactic electroencephalography signals from 11 subjects demonstrated that our approach significantly improved the precision and robustness of speech decoding. Significance. These results underscore the potential of our method to improve the functionality and usability of speech BCIs for people with aphasia.",

      "title": "A potential field shared control approach for wheelchair navigation via brain\u2013computer interface",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients with disabilities control external devices directly without peripheral pathways. Due to the limitations in EEG signal quality, the performance of EEG-based BCIs may not be satisfactory. Shared control has become an important research direction in the field of brain-controlled wheelchairs (BCWs). However, most existing studies do not achieve the flexible movement of BCW in environments with narrow spaces. This study proposes a shared controller based on the potential field method to integrate environmental information and user commands intelligently. Approach. Considering the flexibility of wheelchair movement, we incorporated EEG decoding results obtained through the motor imagery paradigm and fused them with environmental information to create a fusion field. We then used these components separately to construct the BCI and obstacle fields. Twelve subjects participated in the virtual wheelchair navigation experiment, while five subjects took part in the real-world wheelchair navigation experiment, aiming to evaluate the control performance in different scenarios under three control modes (keyboard, BCI-only, and shared control). Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed shared controller: 1) significantly enhances navigation performance in both general and narrow environments compared with BCI-only control; 2) improves the total success rate from 8.33% to 83.33% in virtual complex environments and from 23.33% to 66.67% in real-world two-way navigation; 3) achieves success rates that are statistically comparable to keyboard control (p > 0.05). Moreover, the shared control reduced the average navigation time by nearly 100 s compared with BCI-only control in real-world experiments. Significance. This new shared control method improves the ability of BCWs to move flexibly in challenging, narrow environments.",

      "title": "High-level locomotion intent estimation from electromyography and body posture",
      "content": "Objective. Once we learn a reliable gait, we no longer have to consciously contract individual muscles to walk, or think about the fine-grained low-level control of our joints. Instead, we mainly make decisions on where we want to end up, at what pace and through which path. Estimating this high-level (HL) intent may provide the necessary input to wearable robotic devices to adapt to their user\u2019s needs. We introduce a continuous representation of locomotion goals and investigate how it may be estimated from muscle signals and body posture. Approach. This study investigated methods to estimate a representation of HL locomotion intent, the horizontal walking path. We collected full-body motion capture and bipolar surface electromyography data from 6 subjects during non-steady-state gait. We trained temporal convolutional networks to causally predict the walking path directly or parametrically with a critically damped trajectory model, using a mixture of muscle and body posture signals. Main results. We achieved a mean trajectory estimation accuracy for a 1-second walking path corresponding to using a multimodal model. We simultaneously provided estimates for current and desired walking velocities as constrained by the walking path model, aiding interpretability of the estimator\u2019s output. Significance. Our approach could provide user interfacing in a subject-independent format for wearable robotic devices. Moreover, this HL intent representation is flexible and able to be synthesized in virtual environments, where it can serve as a surrogate for biosignals of simulated intent-driven robotics.",
