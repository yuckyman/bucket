      "title": "Impact of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Event-related Potentials during a Response Inhibition Task",
      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "content": "ObjectivesMost patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) subsequently develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) with multiple seizure foci and are not the typical candidates for resective surgery. We report the first case of DRE developing after cryptogenic-NORSE (C-NORSE) that was successfully treated using deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS).MethodsA 52-year-old man developed C-NORSE at the age of 45\u2009years and presented with sequelae of DRE and cognitive dysfunction despite anti-seizure medications and immunotherapy administration. Seizure semiology comprised palpitations, chills, and nausea, followed by impairment of awareness with oral automatism multiple times a day. Video-electroencephalogram monitoring (vEEG) showed bilateral independent electrographic seizures (ESz) in the fronto-temporal areas. He underwent ANT-DBS. Preoperative and postoperative vEEG recordings for 3\u2009days were compared.ResultsPreoperative vEEG showed 11 clinical seizures correlated with ESz. The duration of ESz ranged from 55 to 213\u2009s (median, 81\u2009s). Three months after ANT-DBS stimulation, vEEG showed four subclinical ESz episodes lasting from 22 to 31\u2009s (median, 25.5\u2009s) (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, p\u2009=\u20090.001). The patient had not developed an overt clinical seizure until the last follow-up at 9\u2009months. No adverse events were observed during treatment.ConclusionANT-DBS is an effective treatment option for DRE after NORSE, particularly when the epileptogenic network is located in the temporal lobe. A detailed evaluation using vEEG is useful for identifying the epileptogenic foci and assessing therapeutic outcome. Immunomodulatory mechanisms via cytokines could play roles in the pathogenesis of development of DRE after NORSE and seizure suppression effect of ANT-DBS.",

      "title": "The trade-off between maximizing reconstruction and physiological interpretation of muscle synergies with autoencoders",
      "content": "IntroductionIn neuroscience, the muscle synergy method is a widely known computational approach for studying motor control from electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Standard algorithms for synergy extraction rely on a linearity assumption for synergy combination. However, the interactions between muscle groups and movement dynamics often exhibit non-linear characteristics, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. In this context, autoencoders (AEs) have been proposed as promising tools. However, previous studies focused on the reconstruction accuracy optimization and not on the structure of the synergies, and the influence of AE design parameters has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to explore the impact of different activation functions on the effectiveness of AEs.MethodsTo this end, we used a rich dataset of upper-limb EMG signals recorded from 16 muscles in 15 participants performing reaching movements toward 9 targets across 5 planes. We evaluated the effects of combining four activation functions in the encoder and decoder layers\u2014linear, ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh\u2014and compared to standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).ResultsOur findings show that the extracted synergies are highly sensitive to the AE architecture. Notably, the configurations obtaining the best signal reconstruction do not correspond to the most physiologically meaningful synergies, which were instead achieved with the ReLU+tanh configuration.DiscussionThis suggests that optimizing reconstruction accuracy may result in non-interpretable synergy structures. This research emphasizes the role of non-linear techniques in extracting muscle synergy from different datasets (e.g., lower limbs, full-body movements, patient populations) and identifies the optimal combination of transfer functions for the encoder and decoder layers.",

      "title": "Exploring gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson\u2019s disease: insights from a 16S amplicon sequencing Eastern European pilot study",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder increasingly associated with alterations in gut microbiota through the gut\u2013brain axis (GBA). Despite growing global interest, studies examining microbiota composition in Eastern European populations remain limited.MethodsWe profiled the gut microbiota of 59 Romanian individuals using 16S rRNA gene sequencing targeting the V3\u2013V4 region. After quality filtering, 39 subjects (19 PD patients and 20 healthy controls [HC]) were retained for downstream analysis. Clinical metadata were collected to assess potential confounders, including age, sex, metabolic parameters, lifestyle, and comorbidities.ResultsPD patients differed significantly from HCs in glycemia (p = 0.02), cholesterol (p = 0.027), and LDL levels (p = 0.047), and more frequently presented with restrictive diets and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While \u03b1-diversity metrics did not differ significantly between groups, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Aitchison distance showed moderate compositional separation. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed that disease status was a significant driver of gut microbiota composition (R2 = 5.3%, p = 0.002), independent of clinical and lifestyle covariates. Sparse partial least square linear discriminant (sPLS-DA) identified several genera distinguishing PD from HC, with Mogibacterium and RikenellaceaeRC9 gut group enriched in PD, and several known short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera (Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, Butyricicoccus, Anaerostipes) enriched in HCs. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) corroborated these findings, confirming the differential abundance of several SCFA-producing genera in the HC group.DiscussionOur results reveal distinct microbial signatures associated with PD in this Romanian cohort, marked by a consistent depletion of SCFA-producing bacteria in patients. These findings support the role of gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology and underscore the need for further studies in Eastern European populations.",

      "title": "Engineered spermidine-secreting Saccharomyces boulardii enhances olfactory memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "IntroductionThe polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are ubiquitous metabolites synthesized in all cells. The intracellular levels of polyamines, especially spermidine, decrease in aging. Oral spermidine supplementation has been reported to alleviate aspects of aging-related disease in animal models, including decline in learning and memory. The diverse health benefits of spermidine supplementation, often at doses that do not significantly alter spermidine levels of target organs, suggests that exogenous spermidine may have a common site of action, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.MethodsTo directly deliver spermidine to the GI tract with minimum impact on the global spermidine levels, we engineered the probiotic yeast Sacchromyces boulardii (Sb) to overproduce and secrete spermidine. We tested the effects of a spermidine-producing yeast strain (Sb576) on aging-associated learning and memory decline in an olfactory classical conditioning assay in Drosophila melanogaster.ResultsFeeding of newly eclosed flies of the wild-type (w1118) strain for 30 days with food supplemented with live Sb576, but not live wild-type Sb (SbWT) or free spermidine, reduced aging-associated short-term memory (STM) decline. Notably, Sb576 supplementation, but not SbWT or spermidine supplementation, of either young flies or old flies for only three days also enhanced STM without affecting locomotive ability. Furthermore, we showed that Sb576 supplementation also significantly reduced aging-associated STM decline in Dh31R, a mutant strain lacking the diuretic hormone 31 receptor, which exhibits compromised learning and memory.ConclusionThese results demonstrate that in situ production of spermidine by a synthetic biotic yeast in the GI tract can enhance STM and further suggest a mechanism involving the gut-brain axis.",

      "title": "Exploring the 31P chemical shift behavior of high-energy phosphates at 7 T in patients with glioma",
      "content": "IntroductionThe characterization of tumor microenvironment in vivo can be supported by 31P MRSI, a non-invasive technique that enables the determination of intracellular pH and magnesium ion concentration, among other parameters. However, it remains unclear from recent studies whether imaging biomarkers, like the intracellular pH value (as determined conventionally via the chemical shift separation between inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine), are correlated with different glioma subtypes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the behavior of multiple chemical shifts, specifically those of Pi and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to approach a more detailed characterization of glioma tissues.MethodsA retrospective analysis on 31P MRSI datasets from 11 patients with newly diagnosed glioma acquired at 7 T prior to any treatment was conducted. Mean values of the quantified chemical shifts of Pi, \u03b3-, \u03b1- and \u03b2-ATP across different regions-of-interest were determined for each patient separately. The mean chemical shifts were compared for different tumor sub-compartments and for different IDH mutation status.ResultsIn high-grade gliomas, significant differences in chemical shifts were observed between tumor and healthy tissue. In low-grade glioma, smaller differences were found for the chemical shifts of Pi, \u03b3- and \u03b1-ATP than in the high-grade glioma. The latter pattern was not observed for \u03b2-ATP resonances, where the mean chemical shift across the tumor was comparably high between low-grade and high-grade glioma. In patients with IDH-wildtype, slightly stronger shifts of Pi and \u03b3-ATP peaks were observed than for patients with IDH-mutant. No differences between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant were observed for the chemical shifts of \u03b1- and \u03b2-ATP.DiscussionThese findings suggest a potential benefit of a joint evaluation of Pi and ATP chemical shifts for possible discrimination of different glioma subtypes. Using the complementary information of multiple 31P chemical shifts could improve the characterization of tumor tissue and provide new insights beyond current knowledge.",

      "content": "Fibrous meningiomas, known for their dense and tough texture, present unique challenges in diagnosis and surgical treatment. This study explores the potential of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for visualizing the microstructures of fibrous meningiomas by combining multichannel and lambda modes. Using MPM, we imaged 14 fibrous meningioma samples collected from neurosurgical procedures. The multichannel mode captured second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) signals, while the lambda mode provided detailed spectral imaging across 32 channels. Image analysis algorithms were developed to quantify collagen content and assess morphological features. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the intrinsic components of fibrous meningiomas, with collagen being the most abundant component (relative ratio: 0.952), followed by structural proteins (0.502), free-form NADH (0.393), FAD (0.199), lipopigments (0.198), protein-bound NADH (0.105), porphyrin derivatives I (0.104), and porphyrin derivatives II (0.015). The combined spectral images also provided high-contrast and high-resolution views of the tumor microenvironment. Quantitative analysis showed that the average collagen content in fibrous meningioma tissues was 0.537\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.131 using SHG imaging and 0.503\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.133 using combined 32-channel spectral imaging. With the advancement of fiber optic technology and multiphoton endoscopy, multiphoton microscopy holds promise as a new technology for clinically diagnosing fibrous meningiomas.",

      "title": "Transcriptomic analysis of identical twins with different onset ages of adrenoleukodystrophy",
      "content": "IntroductionAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked neurogenetic disease caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and severity of ALD remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify information on candidate genes associated with the onset and severity of ALD by transcriptome sequencing of whole blood samples from monozygotic twin families with the disease.MethodsThe identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), set theory analysis, gene enrichment analysis, and classification statistics of expression trends have been executed to acquire potential candidate genes inducing the onset and severity of ALD in patients. The study cohort comprised eight individuals: two normal children, two pediatric twins with ALD, the twins\u2019 mother, their adult uncle with ALD, the twins\u2019grandmother, and one normal adult.ResultsFive distinct sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using whole blood samples from a family of identical twins with different onset ages and ABCD1 exon 2 deletions. Then, 39 DEGs of A \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2212 D and A \u2229 B \u2212 D, as well as 425 DEGs of C \u2229 E, were considered as genes relating to the onset and severity of ALD. In particular, C4BPA, TPBG, CEP112, CHST15, SMAD1, IL-26, and LRRC69 have shown more importance than others in ALD onset. Furthermore, KEGG and GO enrichment further suggested the role of Ca2+ homeostasis and the plasma membrane in ALD onset and severity. Finally, expression pattern analysis further demonstrated the pivotal role of the selected DEG sets.DiscussionThe information on candidate genes of this study was considered crucial for preliminarily exploring the molecular mechanisms related to the onset and severity of ALD, which offered novel insights and research directions for mitigating and treating the development of ALD.",
