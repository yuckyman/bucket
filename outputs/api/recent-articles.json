      "title": "Quantitative analysis of synaptic zinc in the brain by covalent chemistry-based semisynthetic biosensors",
      "content": "Labile zinc ions (Zn(II)) are stored in glutamatergic vesicles at specific excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and released into synaptic clefts in an activity-dependent manner. Although Zn(II) is suggested to modulate various neuroreceptor functions, its precise roles remain unclear due to a lack of tools capable of quantitatively analyzing Zn(II) with synapse-level spatial resolution. Here, we developed neuroreceptor-based semisynthetic sensors that record synaptic Zn(II) dynamics by covalent chemistry in the living mouse brain. Using a chemical knock-in strategy, we introduced activity-based Zn(II)-probes with distinct affinities into endogenous alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid or gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. These in-brain-constructed Zn(II) sensors enabled, to our knowledge, for the first time, quantitative, region-specific mapping of Zn(II) released into synaptic clefts. Imaging-based analyses revealed differences inZn(II) concentrations at excitatory and inhibitory synapses across hippocampal regions during kainate-induced seizures, providing new insights into the physiological and pathological functions of synaptic Zn(II).",

      "title": "Dopaminergic Neurons in the Brain Orchestrates Cardiac and Behavioral Threat Responses",
      "content": "Heartbeat and behavior are often modulated in a tightly coupled fashion, which is believed advantageous for survival. For instance, when threatened animals show freezing or escaping, the brain drives cardiac deceleration or acceleration, respectively. In turn, the heart sends ascending feedback to the brain, but whether and how the descending regulation of and the ascending feedback from the heart might drive the heart-behavior coupling remains unknown. Here we show in Drosophila that mechanical threat induces not only locomotion but cardiac deceleration. We further identified two pairs of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, called DA-WED neurons, that are responsible for threat-induced cardiac deceleration. Silencing DA-WED neurons suppresses threat-induced cardiac deceleration, while activation of DA-WED neurons can replace threat to induce cardiac deceleration. Our calcium imaging analysis shows that threat activates DA-WED neurons. Interestingly, silencing DA-WED neurons to block threat-induced cardiac deceleration reduces locomotion. Conversely, direct manipulation of cardiomyocytes to artificially induce cardiac deceleration promotes locomotion. Together, our data reveals a neuronal mechanism in which mechanical threat regulates the heartbeat through dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and suggests how these neurons possibly prompt feedback from the heart to modulate behavior.",

      "title": "Attention biases the appearance of rapidly alternating stimuli",
      "content": "Attentional selection not only increases behavioural performance and neural information for attended stimuli but, in some instances, induces changes in stimulus appearance. While reported appearance changes have mostly concerned the effects of attending to a particular spatial location, here we report a shift in appearance that occurs when attention is directed to one component of a rapidly alternating stimulus. Our stimuli included two frames of different colours, which alternated at 3.75Hz or 7.5Hz. Participants reported the perceived dominance of one frame's colour in the target stimulus, by comparison with a reference stimulus. We found that when one stimulus frame was more salient than the other, capturing exogenous attention, there was an illusory perception that the frame was physically present for a greater proportion of time. When the frames were matched in salience, endogenously directing attention to one frame produced a smaller shift in appearance. Our results add to the body of literature demonstrating that attention can change appearance, in this case altering the appearance of attended versus unattended stimuli that are presented at the same spatial location. Furthermore, our results support the notion that in 'temporal transparency', where rapidly alternating stimuli are perceived as two translucent surfaces, attentional selection of one surface can account for the apparent paradox that feature conjunctions are perceived at stimulus alternation rates higher than predicted by the temporal limits of feature binding for other stimuli.",

      "title": "Restoration of Higher-Order Cortical Processing in Rat V2 by Retinal Sheet Transplants in Degenerated Rats",
      "content": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, and effective treatment options are limited once photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are lost. In advanced stages, vision restoration requires strategies that replace or bypass degenerated retinal circuitry. Retinal sheet transplantation using fetal neural retinal tissue has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating long-term survival, integration with the host retina, and partial restoration of light-driven responses. We previously showed that such transplants can restore fundamental visual response properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rapidly degenerating rats. However, it remains unclear whether restored retinal input can support higher-order cortical computations that depend on the integration of classical and extra-classical receptive field mechanisms. In this study, we extend this investigation by evaluating whether fetal retinal sheet transplants can restore extra-classical surround modulation in neurons of higher visual areas (V2). Fetal retinal sheets (E18-E19) derived from donor rats were transplanted into one eye of Rho-S334ter line-3 rats at ages P41-P78, when rod degeneration is nearly complete and cones are largely nonfunctional. Animals were assessed 2.2-9.3 months post-surgery using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings from V2, optokinetic testing, OCT imaging, and histology. Control groups included normal-vision rats, age-matched degenerated rats (AMC), and sham-operated line-3 rats. Transplants survived long term, developed laminated and rosetted photoreceptor structures, and integrated with the host retina. Optokinetic testing revealed significant improvement in spatial acuity in transplanted eyes compared with degenerated controls beginning at three months post-surgery. Transplanted rats exhibited a markedly higher proportion of visually responsive V2 neurons than degenerated animals (21.0% vs. 8.2%). They also showed significantly shorter response latencies and larger visually evoked response amplitudes, indicating improved transmission of retinal signals to the cortex. To quantify surround suppression, neurons were tested with sinusoidal gratings confined to the classical receptive field and gratings extended to full-field size. Transplanted rats displayed robust surround suppression properties similar to normal controls, including significantly reduced firing rates and narrower tuning under full-field conditions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on net responses to CRF and FF stimulus sizes reliably distinguished control and transplanted neurons from degenerated ones but could not separate control from transplant, further indicating similar response properties in these two groups. These findings provide the first demonstration that retinal sheet transplants restore not only basic visual responses but also higher-order cortical mechanisms involving extra-classical surround suppression. This recovery of surround suppression in V2 suggests that transplanted retinal tissue can re-establish functionally meaningful circuits capable of supporting complex visual processing. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of retinal sheet transplantation for advanced retinal degenerative disease and provide the first evidence of surround suppression in the rat V2.",

      "title": "Systematic microcircuit reconfigurations underlie early experience-induced visual cortical plasticity",
      "content": "Experience-dependent reorganization of neuronal connections during a postnatal critical period (CP) is essential for the functional maturation of developing primary visual cortex (V1). However, the systematic reconfigurations across microcircuit synapses underlying this plasticity were poorly defined. Paired recording from excitatory pyramidal cells and other three major interneurons (INs) within layers 2/3 and 4 microcircuits in the developing mouse V1 monocular region, we find that monocular deprivation (MD) for one-day during the CP transiently reconfigures local excitatory synapses on inhibitory INs that specifically express parvalbumin (PV) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), whereas prolonged MD primarily strengthens inhibitory transmission from somatostatin (SST)-expressing INs to PV-INs and VIP-INs in both layers. A physiologically based microcircuit model suggests these coordinated synaptic changes in specific inhibitory neurons mediate differential MD-induced plasticity in visual responses across layer 2/3 neurons in vivo. Together, our findings define a systematic microcircuit basis for cortical critical-period plasticity.",
