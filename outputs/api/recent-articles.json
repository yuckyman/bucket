      "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Human Neocortical Glutamatergic Neurons Revealed Through Multimodal Profiling",
      "content": "The human neocortex underlies higher cognition and is the engine of complex thought. Yet our understanding of its neuronal diversity is limited by sparse access to tissue, inconsistent sampling across studies, and a lack of multiple modality data. Although single-cell transcriptomic taxonomies are an important framework for characterizing cell type diversity, transcriptomic information alone cannot reveal the cellular properties that define neuronal computations. To address this, we performed Patch-seq, a method for collecting Morphology, Electrophysiology, and Transcriptomic data from a single neuron. We focused on glutamatergic, neocortical, excitatory neurons, the principal long-range projecting neurons of the cortex, and systematically integrated their morphoelectric features with transcriptomic identity. In combination with spatial transcriptomic data, we interrogated 39 of 42 transcriptomically-defined neuron types with a layer-centric perspective. Morphoelectric properties, such as cortical depth, apical dendrite structure, and excitability clearly distinguish transcriptomic subclasses and support many finer transcriptomic types. Morphoelectric properties are influenced by spatial location in supragranular layers, while deeper layers exhibit greater heterogeneity. Cross-species comparisons reveal conserved subclass organization but pronounced differences in apical dendrite arborization between mouse and human, and surprising similarities between human and macaque. Together, these datasets provide a unified multimodal reference that advances our understanding of human cortical circuitry and establishes a foundation for experimental and computational studies of human brain function and disease.",

      "title": "Emergent Traveling Waves in Neural Circuits",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks achieve striking performance but do not capture a prominent neural property. Cortical activity is organized by structured spatiotemporal dynamics, traveling waves (TW), which have been implicated in a wide range of functions. Existing computational models often rely on hand-crafted connectivity and imposed dynamics, offering insight into their impact but less into how the waves naturally emerge in biological circuits. Here, we found that TWs emerge in models under biologically plausible constraints (spatially organized, directionally biased connectivity). Under an empirical neural manifold constraint, these wiring principles naturally emerge to support traveling wave dynamics in the recurrent model. We further show that wave propagation provides a robust mechanism for maintaining working memory in the presence of visual distractors. We compared these model predictions to non-human primate prefrontal cortex recordings, revealing a similar mechanism. Together, these results advance our understanding of traveling waves as a substrate for cognition and offer a framework for mechanistic accounts of cortical computation.",

      "content": "Dysglycaemia is linked to brain atrophy, white-matter disruption and dementia risk, yet the directionality and mechanisms of glycemic-brain coupling remain unclear. Here we integrate large-scale GWAS of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes with multimodal brain imaging phenotypes and major brain disorders using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization. Across 4,040 tests, we identify 54 glycaemia and brain causal associations (FDR P < 0.05) and uncover a timescale-dependent hierarchy: short-term glycemic traits map to distributed macrostructure and functional-network, whereas long-term glycemic burden preferentially implicates long-range association and commissural white-matter pathways with focal prefrontal-paracentral vulnerability. Reverse analyses reveal 44 brain IDPs and glycaemia effects. Multi-trait Bayesian colocalization and tissue/cell type eQTL integration nominate shared causal loci enriched in glial and neurovascular pathways. Individual-level UK Biobank analyses validated glycaemia-associated brain structural alterations and non-linear risk patterns for incident outcomes. Together, our results provide a genetically anchored atlas of bidirectional glycemic-neural relationships, linking metabolic dysregulation to multiscale brain vulnerability and disorder risk.",

      "title": "Cognitive and emotional responses to viewing mummies in an Egyptian museum",
      "content": "IntroductionA recent subfield of neuropsychology is the study of people\u2019s reactions to visiting a museum and observing artworks. However, museums do not only contain artworks or archeological finds, and some of them exhibit human remains, such as mummies. A growing debate concerns the ethical issues of such exhibitions, but the psychological and physiological reactions of visitors when viewing mummies have not yet been measured.MethodsIn this study, 33 subjects (40.3 \u00b1 14.4 years old) participated in two experiments conducted at the Egyptian Museum of Turin (Italy). In the first experiment, they were asked to observe an empty sarcophagus, an opened sarcophagus with a mummy inside, and an open sarcophagus with the mummy placed between the cover and the coffin of the sarcophagus. Subjects wore an electroencephalographic (EEG) system on their heads, electrodes on their fingers to measure skin conductance levels (SCL) and wore eye-tracking glasses. In the second experiment, they visited the room of the \u201cThree Sisters\u201d with two completely bandaged mummies and one partially unbandaged. The indices extracted from EEG and SCL signals were compared before and after they noticed the partially unbandaged mummy.ResultsCognitive workload was found to increase due to the presence of the mummies in the first experiment, whereas an increase in emotional arousal (SCL) was observed in the second experiment after participants saw that partially unbandaged mummy.DiscussionThe presence of mummies increased the emotional engagement, but it was not an effect specific leading to negative emotions.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
      "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "AMANet: a data-augmented multi-scale temporal attention convolutional network for motor imagery classification",
      "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

This operation underpins sensing and computation in both neuromorphic architectures and biological nervous systems. Rigorous analysis of such systems is rarely attempted because the statistical tools to study them are both inaccessible and largely unknown to the neuromorphic community.MethodsWe offer a gentle introduction to one such tool, sequential analysis, a classical framework that addresses a particular class of threshold-crossing problems. We define the formal problem analyzed in sequential analysis and present Abraham Wald's elegant methodology for solving it.ResultsWe then apply this framework to three examples in neuromorphic engineering, demonstrating how it can serve as a benchmark, proxy model, and design tool. Our introduction is understandable without prior training in probability or statistics.DiscussionSequential analysis provides the statistical limits of circuit performance, tractable abstractions of complex circuit behavior, and constructive rules for circuit design. It establishes rigorous statistical baselines for evaluating hardware. It links low-level circuit parameters to observable dynamics, clarifying the computational role of neuromorphic architectures. By translating performance goals into optimal thresholds and design parameters, it offers principled prescriptions that go beyond empirical tuning.",
