      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Retinal neovascularization is one of the most prevalent fundus neovascular diseases, affecting vision and potentially leading to severe complications, such as retinal detachment or irreversible blindness. Current treatments primarily involve intravitreal injections (IVT) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, such treatment often requires repeated injections, develop incomplete responses, and are associated with adverse effects. Therefore, novel therapeutic...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: While GPT-4o shows promise identifying severe DR, limitations in distinguishing early stages exist and highlight the need for further refinement before clinical usage in DR screening. Unlike traditional CNN-based tools like IDx-DR, GPT-4o is a multimodal foundation model with a fundamentally different architecture and training process, which may contribute to its diagnostic limitations. GPT-4o and other LLMs are not designed to learn about important DR features like microaneurysms or...",

AD created by professionals or novice describers is time-consuming and offers little customization or control to BLV viewers on description length and content and when they receive it. To address this gap, we explore user-driven AI-generated descriptions, enabling BLV viewers to control both the timing and level of detail of the...",

Observational studies including cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies tend to report social determinants of health which could inform evidence syntheses on health equity and social justice.

Once technical proficiency is achieved, surgical outcomes are favorable and complications are low. Despite the drawbacks such as a slight sense of vertigo during use and high cost, the 3D endoscope provides a stereoscopic view. More research is essential to verify its role in MVD surgery.",
