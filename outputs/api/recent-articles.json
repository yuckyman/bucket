      "title": "Conserved Axonal Transcriptome Dynamics Underlie PGE2-Induced Sensitisation and Identify Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a Regulator of Neuronal Excitability in DRG Neurons",
      "content": "Chronic pain arises when dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons become sensitised to noxious inputs, a process driven by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Local translation of axonal mRNAs is a key regulator of nociceptor plasticity, yet how axonal transcriptome dynamics contribute to inflammatory sensitisation remains unclear. Using compartmentalised culture systems and RNA-sequencing, we defined axonal and somatic transcriptomes in embryonic (E16.5) and adult (W8) DRG neurons and assessed their remodelling after PGE2 exposure. We identify a conserved core axonal transcriptome spanning embryonic to adult stages, prominently enriched for ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, consistent with sustained translational and metabolic demands. PGE2 elicited compartment-specific reprogramming: pathways related to sensory processing and pain were upregulated in axons but downregulated in somata. Functionally, prolonged axonal PGE2 exposure enhanced capsaicin-evoked calcium responses and drove retrograde sensitisation of neuronal somata. Integrating transcriptomics with functional assays, we pinpointed Tnfrsf12a (Fn14), a cytokine receptor linked to regeneration and neuropathic pain, as a PGE2-induced axonal mRNA. Crucially, local axonal knockdown of Tnfrsf12a significantly reduced neuronal excitability, providing proof-of-concept that axonally enriched transcripts can be targeted to modulate sensitisation. These findings position conserved axonal transcriptome programmes as drivers of peripheral sensitisation and establish Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a therapeutic candidate for inflammatory pain.",

      "title": "Benchmarking Orientation Distribution Function Estimation Methods for Tractometry in Single-Shell Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging - An Evaluation of Test-Retest Reliability and Predictive Capability",
      "content": "Deriving white matter (WM) bundles in-vivo has thus far mainly been applied in research settings, leveraging high angular resolution, multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisitions that enable advanced reconstruction methods. However, these advanced acquisitions are both time-consuming and costly to acquire. The ability to reconstruct WM bundles in the massive amounts of existing single-shelled, lower angular resolution data from legacy research studies and healthcare systems would offer much broader clinical applications and population-level generalizability. While legacy scans may offer a valuable, large-scale complement to contemporary research datasets, the reliability of white matter bundles derived from these scans remains unclear. Here, we leverage a large research dataset where each 64-direction dMRI scan was acquired as two independent 32-direction runs per subject. To investigate how recently developed bundle segmentation methods generalize to this data, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of the two 32-direction scans, of WM bundle extraction across three orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstruction methods: generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and single-shell three-tissue CSD (SS3T). We found that the majority of WM bundles could be reliably extracted from dMRI scans that were acquired using the 32-direction, single-shell acquisition scheme. The mean dice coefficient of reconstructed WM bundles was consistently higher within-subject than between-subject for all WM bundles and ODF reconstruction methods, illustrating preservation of person-specific anatomy. Further, when using features of the bundles to predict complex reasoning assessed using a computerized cognitive battery, we observed stable prediction accuracies (r: 0.15-0.36) across the test-retest data. Among the three ODF reconstruction methods, SS3T had a good balance between sensitivity and specificity in external validation, a high intra-class correlation of extracted features, more plausible bundles, and strong predictive performance. More broadly, these results demonstrate that bundle segmentation can achieve robust performance even on lower angular resolution, single-shell dMRI, with particular advantages for ODF methods optimized for single-shell data. This highlights the considerable potential for dMRI collected in healthcare settings and legacy research datasets to accelerate and expand the scope of WM research.",

      "title": "Redefined Strategies to generate Conditional miR-141/200c miRNA cluster Knockout mice to eliminate confounding neo cassettes",
      "content": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of the miR-200 family specifically miR-141 and miR0-200c regulate neurogenesis, differentiation, and epithelial mesenchymal transitions in development and several diseases including cancer and stroke. The STOCK Mirc13tm1Mtm /Mmjax mouse line, which targets the miR-141/200c cluster, was originally described by Park et al. (2012) as a conditional knockout-first allele requiring a two-step breeding strategy: Flp recombination to excise lacZ/neo cassettes followed by Cre recombination to delete the floxed miRNA cluster. However, subsequent studies frequently bypassed this step and reported knockouts based on direct crosses with Cre mouse lines, leaving residual lacZ/neo sequences that may silence upstream elements or introduce transcriptional artifacts. Here, we present a detailed and refined strategy to generate both global and tissue-specific miR-141/200c knockouts that adheres to the original design intent and eliminates confounding cassettes. Our approach confirmed robust baseline expression of miR-141 and miR-200c in various organs such olfactory bulbs and lungs where these miRNAs are robustly expressed, with near-complete loss of expression in knockout animals as validated by qPCR and in situ hybridization. By restoring a clean floxed allele prior to Cre deletion, we establish a reliable and interpretable mouse model for dissecting the roles of the miR-141/200c cluster miRNA in various disease models in these mice.",

      "title": "Obesogenic Diet Impairs Social Memory Through Alterations of Hippocampal CA2 Excitability and Oxytocin Signaling",
      "content": "While obesity induces cardio-metabolic disorders and cognitive deficits, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unexplored. In mice, exposure to an obesogenic high-fat and sugar diet (HFD) resulted in social recognition memory deficits, a process that is dependent upon hippocampal area CA2 and oxytocin signaling. HFD-fed mice had stronger inputs onto CA2 pyramidal neurons that led to increased action potential firing, without altering intrinsic properties or inhibitory transmission. Chemogenetic CA2 inhibition rescued HFD-induced social memory deficits, confirming the role of CA2 hyperexcitability in these effects. In CA2, oxytocin receptor activation resulted in membrane depolarization, spontaneous action-potential firing and permitted endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity in control diet-fed mice, but not HFD-fed littermates. In a concentration-dependent manner, oxytocin restored potentiation of excitatory responses and allowed for endocannabinoid plasticity at CA2 inhibitory synapses as well as social memory deficits in HFD-fed mice. By investigating the influence of diet on hippocampal area CA2, this study uncovers novel mechanisms linking neuromodulation and plasticity in social memory encoding.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

Diabetic retinopathy, if not detected and treated in time, threatens the patient's vision and eventually causes complete blindness. Among various clinical symptoms, microaneurysm appears as the first sign of diabetic retinopathy. Accurate and reliable detection of microaneurysms is a challenging problem due to its small size and low contrast....",
