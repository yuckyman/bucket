      "title": "The influence of force on the encoding and perception of affective touch",
      "content": "Stroking touch has been shown to be most pleasant at intermediate velocities of 1-10 cm.s-1, which relates well to activity of C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), also called C-tactile afferents in humans, that have been implicated in encoding positive affective touch. This well-established finding has been demonstrated at gentle stroking forces (typically 0.4 N peak normal force), yet few studies have investigated the effect of force on the perception of stroking touch or on the activity of C-LTMRs. Presently, we investigated the perceptual pleasantness and intensity of stroking touch (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm.s-1) at different forces (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 N) on hairy forearm skin and compared this to responses from C-LTMRs during stroking touch at the same velocities, but over fewer forces (0.05, 0.4, 1.5 N). We found significant effects of stroking velocity and force for both tactile pleasantness and intensity ratings. Pleasantness showed the typical inverted-U shaped relationship over stroking velocities, but this was modified by force: higher forces significantly decreased pleasantness at faster velocities. Conversely, tactile intensity increased linearly with both increasing velocity and force. Recordings from five C-LTMRs showed that their firing frequency changed with stroking velocity, but that they were strongly modulated by force. Overall, we demonstrate the profound effect that force has on the perception of stroking touch, where tactile pleasantness and intensity appear to be a multi-faceted construct that are related to C-LTMR and A{beta}-LTMR activity, respectively, but that the firing in individual mechanoreceptor populations cannot fully account for percepts.",

      "title": "Guessing reveals internal models of perceptual precision",
      "content": "When observers lack sufficient information to support a confident response, they often guess. Guessing plays a pervasive role in visual cognition and working memory, yet the mechanisms that govern how observers generate guesses remain poorly understood. Standard models traditionally assume that responses produced in the absence of information are either uniformly distributed over feature space or are perhaps weighted towards prevailing environmental statistics. In contrast, here we consider an intriguing alternative: that guesses incorporate observers' knowledge of their own perceptual capacities. We empirically measured guessing by eliciting responses under extreme target uncertainty (Experiment 1) as well as a novel '0ms presentation' approach in which no stimulus appeared but subjects believed one had (Experiment 2). We evaluated three accounts of guesses under these conditions: unsystematic (lapse) responding, biases toward environmental statistics, and a self-representational account in which guesses reflect observers' knowledge of their own feature-dependent precision (e.g., preferring to guess feature values they believe they would be likely to miss). Guess responses were non-uniform and systematically biased toward feature values typically encoded with the least precision (e.g., oblique orientations) - a counterintuitive bias away from high-frequency, high-fidelity feature values (e.g., cardinal orientations). This complementary relationship between guessing and perceptual fidelity held within individuals and across paradigms, and was recoverable via an empirical-guess mixture model that replaced the standard uniform assumption with empirically measured guess distributions. Our findings challenge prevailing views that guesses reflect random noise, and suggest instead that guessing behavior reflects metacognitive knowledge of internal precision. Rather than defaulting to environmental priors, observers appear to model their own sensory limitations and leverage these representations to inform decisions in the absence of evidence. These results reframe guessing as a theoretically informative behavior that expresses observers' own beliefs about their perceptual capacities.",

      "title": "Ask HN: Claude Opus performance affected by time of day?",
      "content": "<p>I am a big fan of Claude Opus as it has been very good at understanding feature requests and generally staying consistent with my codebase (completely written from scratch using Opus).<p>I've noticed recently that when I am using Opus at night (Eastern US), I am seeing it go down extreme rabbit holes on the same types of requests I am putting through on a regular basis. It is more likely to undertake refactors that break the code and then iterates on those errors in a sort of spiral. A request that would normally take 3-4 minutes will turn into a 10 minute adventure before I revert the changes, call out the mistake, and try again. It will happily admit the mistake, but the pattern seems to be consistent.<p>I haven't performed a like for like test and that would be interesting, but has anyone else noticed the same?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46648900\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46648900</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
