      "title": "Standardized brain and plasma EV enrichment pipeline validated for Single sample multi-Omic and fatty acids applications in Mouse and Human",
      "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication, yet their molecular profiles across tissues and species remain poorly characterized, particularly due to currently available methods requiring a large amount of biological material (tissue or biofluids). Here, we established a workflow allowing the deep phenotyping of EV cargos starting from single samples of human and mouse origin. We took advantage of standardised EV isolation procedures and multi-omic techniques for the isolation and analysis of EVs from brain and plasma of human and mouse, integrating flow cytometric profiling, proteomics, miRNA sequencing, and fatty acid profiling. Here we report specific brain-derived EVs proteome, enriched in neuronal and glial proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids profiles, and distinct miRNAs. At the periphery, we also report plasma-derived EVs signatures reflecting immune, metabolic, and systemic transport functions. Despite these expected material-specific differences, EVs from the same source displayed greater similarity across species than EVs from different material, supporting the translational relevance of mouse models. Importantly, using state-of-the-art miRNA profiling approach, we identified novel EV-specific miRNAs in human and mouse brain EVs, potentially allowing the exploration of new roles in neuronal signalling. Overall, we report here a method enabling deep multi-omic characterization from minimal starting material, offering a practical approach for studies with limited biological samples. These findings also demonstrate that the origin strongly shapes EV composition, highlighting conserved and species-specific molecular features, and provide a scalable framework for multi-omic investigations of EV biology.",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
