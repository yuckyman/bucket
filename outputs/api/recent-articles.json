      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

I\u2019ve been working on a passion project that turned into a full-stack anime ecosystem \u2014 and I wanted to share it with you all.

It\u2019s built in Python with FastAPI and has documentation and proxy support tailored for mobile clients. \ufffc</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 2) MCP Anime Server \u2014 Anime discovery through MCP (Model Context Protocol)</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/MCP_Anime\">https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/MCP_Anime</a></p> <p>I wrapped the anime data into an MCP server with ~26 tools like search_anime, get_popular_anime, get_anime_details, MAL rankings, seasonal fetch, filtering by genre/type \u2014 basically a full featured anime backend that works with any MCP-compatible client (e.g., Claude Desktop). \ufffc</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 3) OtakuHub Flutter App \u2014 A complete Flutter mobile app</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/OtakuHub_App\">https://github.com/Shalin-Shah-2002/OtakuHub_App</a></p> <p>On top of the backend projects, I built a Flutter app that consumes the API and delivers the anime experience natively on mobile. It handles searching, browsing, and playback using the proxy URLs to solve mobile stream header issues. \ufffc (Repo has the app code + integration with the API &amp; proxy endpoints.)</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>Why this matters:</p> <p>\u2705 You get a production-ready API that solves real mobile playback limitations.</p> <p>\u2705 You get an MCP server for AI/assistant integrations.</p> <p>\u2705 You get a client app that brings it all together.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1 It\u2019s a real end-to-end anime data stack \u2014 from backend scraping + enrichment, to AI-friendly tooling, to real mobile UI.</p> <p>Would love feedback, contributions, or ideas for features to add next (recommendations, watchlists, caching, auth, etc)!</p> <p>Happy coding \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dev_him\"> /u/dev_him </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px4uht/i_built_a_full_anime_ecosystem_api_mcp_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px4uht/i_built_a_full_anime_ecosystem_api_mcp_server/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Chronic Circadian Disturbance Reshapes Hippocampal Connectivity and Cognitive Function",
      "content": "Circadian rhythms regulate a wide range of physiological and cognitive functions, yet the neural mechanisms linking circadian timing to memory remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a direct anatomical projection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the dorsal hippocampus using complementary viral anterograde, retrograde, and monosynaptic tracing approaches, alongside established indirect pathways via septal and neuromodulatory regions. These findings revise prevailing models that restrict SCN influence on hippocampal function to polysynaptic routes. Functionally, chronic circadian disruption (CCD) induced region-specific metabolic alterations and widespread reorganization of brain-wide functional connectivity (FC). Hypometabolism emerged in the SCN, dentate gyrus, and perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, accompanied by loss of SCN-hippocampal connectivity and compensatory engagement of cortical and subcortical networks. In contrast, the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus showed selective hypermetabolism and increased connectivity with the SCN, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, suggesting altered neuromodulatory control under circadian misalignment. Behaviorally, CCD produced a selective impairment in object recognition memory, while spatial memory, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse remained intact. Disrupted functional coupling within perirhinal-entorhinal-hippocampal and prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, together with altered SCN-medial septum-hippocampus connectivity, indicates that cognitive dysfunction arises from desynchronization of distributed brain networks rather than local synaptic failure. Together, these findings provide a new mechanistic framework linking circadian disruption to selective memory impairment and highlight network-level synchrony as a potential target for chronotherapeutic intervention.",

      "title": "BDH1-Dependent Ketone Body Metabolism Maintains Muller Cell Homeostasis and Retinal Function",
      "content": "Ketone body metabolism serves as an auxiliary regulator of cellular energetics and redox balance, particularly during prolonged fasting and carbohydrate restriction, yet its role in retinal homeostasis under physiological conditions remains poorly defined. {beta}-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that interconverts acetoacetate and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, and is required for efficient ketone utilization. Here, we investigated the impact of impaired endogenous ketone metabolism on retinal function using global and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)--specific BDH1 knockout (KO) mice. Global BDH1 KO mice showed reduced circulating {beta}-hydroxybutyrate and blunted fasting-induced ketone elevations, accompanied by ganglion cell loss, structural abnormalities on fundus and OCT imaging, and diminished scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) a- and b-wave amplitudes, consistent with impaired photoreceptor responses and downstream bipolar and Muller cell signaling. In contrast, RPE-specific BDH1 KO mice exhibited no changes in ERG responses or retinal morphology. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses in global KO retinas revealed disrupted Muller cell homeostasis, including reduced CAMKII-CREB activation, which is required for EAAT1 glutamate transporter expression. Administration of exogenous {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, in vitro and in vivo, restored CAMKII--CREB--EAAT1 signaling, glutamate uptake, and antioxidant gene expression in BDH1 KO mice, demonstrating a central role for ketone bodies in Muller cell metabolic support, glutamate homeostasis, and redox balance. Together with reduced BDH1 expression in human AMD retinas, these findings identify the BDH1--{beta}-hydroxybutyrate axis as a critical metabolic pathway for Muller cell function and retinal integrity, and highlight ketone metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in degenerative retinal diseases.",

      "title": "Connections of early visual areas with posterior parietal and temporal cortex in galagos, a strepsirrhine primate",
      "content": "To better understand the cortical connections and organization of visual areas in galagos, we examined the interconnections among cortical visual fields and their relationships with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and temporal regions associated with dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In five galagos, two to four distinguishable tracers were injected into different visual areas, allowing direct comparison of connection patterns within the same cases. To reveal distributions of labeled neurons for each injection, labeled cells were plotted from serial brain sections cut parallel to the flattened cortical surface and summed across sections to generate surface reconstructions. Alternate sections processed for cytoarchitectonic features were used to identify cortical borders, especially those of V1 and middle temporal visual area (MT). Overall, our results support the conclusion that regions of V2 and V3 represent the contralateral visual hemifield in parallel with V1 and with each other. However, dorsal V3, representing the lower visual hemifield, includes at least one discontinuity where representations of the upper visual field extend to the dorsal border of V2. This portion of V3 appears to belong to the dorsomedial visual area (DM), which extends rostrally from V2 into PPC. The dorsal part of the DL-V4 region receives projections from other parts of dorsolateral visual area (DL), central V1, V2 and V3, inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the MT complex, and PPC regions surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). More central portions of DL-V4 receive inputs from central representations of V1, V2, and V3, as well as from PPC regions lateral to the IPS, the MT complex, and upper IT cortex. The ventral part of DL receives projections from central V2, caudal PPC adjoining DM and ventral PPC, and from IT cortex. These patterns indicate that the DL-V4 region serves as a major node linking dorsal and ventral streams and likely includes more than one functionally distinct visual area. In addition, areas MT and DM show strong reciprocal connections with PPC, while the connections of IT cortex indicate that much of this region is visual in nature having strong connections with higher order visual areas and it is composed of multiple functionally specialized visual domains.",
