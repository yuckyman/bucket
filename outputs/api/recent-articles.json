      "title": "Hormonal control of postmitotic neuronal identity",
      "content": "The Drosophila central complex is a brain region that coordinates complex behaviors through precisely wired circuits composed of diverse neuronal subtypes. Dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons integrate internal-state signals to regulate sleep, feeding, and energy homeostasis, yet how dFB subtypes are specified and maintained remains unclear. More importantly, how a developmental transcription factor regulates neuronal identity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the developmental origin and post-mitotic regulation of neuronal identity in dFB subtypes labeled by the 84C10 driver, which innervates layers 6-7 of the fan-shaped body and contributes to nutrient sensing and metabolic adaptation. Using lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and birth-dating, we show that 84C10 dFB neurons derive primarily from the DL1 type II neural stem cell lineage, with a minor contribution from DM4, and are generated during a late larval temporal window after ~48 h after larval hatching (ALH). These late-born neurons maintain expression of ecdysone-responsive transcription factor E93 into adulthood. Selective postmitotic knockdown of E93 in mature 84C10 neurons causes progressive neuronal loss, ectopic expansion of axonal arborizations across fan-shaped body layers, and downregulation of the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT. These circuit defects are accompanied by a failure to mount normal triglyceride accumulation in response to high-sugar feeding. Together, our results demonstrate that a late temporal transcription factor, E93, is retained post-mitotically to preserve neuronal survival, layer-specific connectivity, and neurotransmitter identity in a behaviorally relevant dFB population, revealing how developmental programs are repurposed to sustain the long-term function of adult behavioral circuits.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

      "content": "The present PRISMA-guided article systematically reviews the current state of research on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
