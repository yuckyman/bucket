      "title": "In vitro reconstitution of hippocampal cell assemblies",
      "content": "Three-dimensional neuronal cultures, such as brain organoids, have proven effective for in vitro modeling of brain development and disease. However, it remains unclear whether these systems can intrinsically generate the spatiotemporal network motifs that support cognitive function, particularly given their lack of sensory input. To address this, we developed a 3D long-range modular neuronal network approach to test whether dissociated embryonic hippocampal cells can self-organize into neuronal manifolds capable of generating network dynamics analogous to the in vivo hippocampal cell assemblies implicated in cognitive function. Using all-optical interrogation, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of cell assemblies and their hallmark features, including recurring sequential activation, hierarchical chaining, multi-day stability, resilience to perturbation, and attractor-like pattern completion. We further investigated the effects of acute ketamine exposure on these assemblies, revealing network-wide reconfiguration reminiscent of in vivo responses. Finally, we show that human iPSC-derived neurons can similarly self-organize into modular network architectures. Together, these findings are consistent with an intrinsically inside-out view of the brain, rather than a tabula rasa model in which sensory input is required for the emergence of cognitive network motifs, and open new avenues for in vitro modeling of network-level mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
