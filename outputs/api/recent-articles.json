      "content": "Accurate detection and segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a challenging task due to their small size, irregular shape, and variability in different imaging modalities. Precise segmentation of MS lesions from brain MRI is vital for early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment planning. We introduce MS-DASPNet, a Dual Attention Guided Deep Neural Network specifically designed to address the challenges of MS lesion detection, including small lesion sizes, low contrast, and heterogeneous appearance. MS-DASPNet employs a VGG-16-based encoder, an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) bottleneck for multi-scale context learning, and dual attention modules in each skip connection to simultaneously refine spatial details and enhance channel-wise feature representation. Evaluations on four publicly available datasets, namely ISBI-2015, Mendeley, MICCAI-2016, and MICCAI-2021, demonstrate that MS-DASPNet achieves superior Precision, Dice, Sensitivity, and Jaccard scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. MS-DASPNet attains a Dice score of 0.8736 on the MICCAI-2016 dataset and 0.8706 on the MICCAI-2021 dataset, both outperforming existing segmentation techniques, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in accurate MS lesion segmentation.",

      "content": "Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson\u2013Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (with low and high activity) and \u201cbroken symmetry\u201d phases. Symmetric phases are characterized by the same low or high activity in all the modules, while the broken symmetry phases are characterized by a high activity in a subset of the modules and low activity in the remaining ones. There are two lines of critical points, the first between the low activity symmetric phase and the high activity symmetric phase, and the second between the low activity symmetric phase and a broken symmetry phase with one active module. At those lines the system shows a critical behavior, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Avalanche shapes differ systematically along the two lines: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the transition with the symmetric phase, but become left-skewed over intermediate durations along critical line with the broken symmetry phase. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.",

      "title": "AI-driven audience clustering in sport media: a human\u2013computer interaction approach using \u2018CoPE-DEC\u2019",
      "content": "This study investigates the characteristics and underlying patterns of sports media audiences from a human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) perspective using artificial intelligence\u2013based deep learning analysis, with the aim of providing foundational data for the sports media industry. To this end, a novel unsupervised clustering framework, the Column-conditioned Prototype-Enhanced Deep Embedded Clustering (CoPE-DEC) technique, was employed to model and analyze multidimensional viewer experience data derived from sports media consumption contexts. The analysis identified three distinct audience clusters with differentiated behavioral, attitudinal, and value-oriented characteristics. The first cluster, labeled \u201cSports Value Orientation,\u201d was characterized by enhanced concentration during sports viewing, promotion of cooperative skills, motivation for health and exercise, vicarious satisfaction, aesthetic appreciation of sports movements, and admiration for athletes\u2019 professional and economic success. The second cluster, termed \u201cSports Consumption Culture Orientation,\u201d exhibited a strong preference for sports broadcasts over entertainment content, frequent consumption of online sports media, active engagement with preferred sports, participation in sports-related tourism and activities, acquisition of sports skills through media, and consumption of sports-related products. The third cluster, identified as \u201cSports Attitude Orientation,\u201d reflected predominantly social and emotional dimensions of sports viewing, including improved social adaptation, relationship formation, group cohesion, stress relief, psychological stabilization, healthy competitive attitudes, and enhanced overall wellbeing. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven deep learning approaches, particularly the CoPE-DEC framework, are effective in uncovering latent audience typologies and preference structures in sports media consumption environments. By integrating HCI principles with advanced clustering techniques, this study offers a methodological contribution to audience analysis research and provides practical implications for audience segmentation, personalized content design, and strategic decision-making in the sports media industry. Future research is encouraged to extend this approach by incorporating diverse AI methodologies and multimodal data sources to further advance interdisciplinary insights at the intersection of HCI, artificial intelligence, and sports media studies.",

      "content": "IntroductionPrevious corpus-based study first established an annotated dataset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) discourse, and subsequent modeling of lexicogrammatical patterns distinguished ASD from non-ASD discourse with high performance (accuracy 80%, precision 82%, sensitivity 73%, specificity 87%). That line of research further identified 46 statistically significant discriminators, of which 20 were analyzed in detail. The present study examines 18 additional discriminators and situates them within cognitive-functional domains to clarify their diagnostic relevance. Findings refine the language\u2013cognition interface in ASD and extend the utility of lexicogrammatical profiling for assessment.MethodsThe Tag Linear Model was employed to identify lexicogrammatical features that distinguish ASD and non-ASD discourse. Logistic regression with 10,000 bootstrap iterations was applied to establish statistical significance. Although DNN models yielded higher predictive accuracy, the linear model provided transparent identification of discriminators.ResultsOf the 135 items analyzed, 46 were confirmed as statistically significant discriminators (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Eighteen of these, not previously examined, were analyzed in the present study. The discriminators were mapped onto 12 cognitive-functional domains, including working memory, executive functioning, joint attention, predictive processing, and weak central coherence. The results reveal distinctive patterns across multiple domains, including reduced use of benefactive auxiliaries, relational attributive clauses, obligation modality, evaluative and gradational resources, and mimetic onomatopoeia, reflecting systematic constraints in abstraction, perspective-taking, and pragmatic orientation.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that choice patterns of lexicogrammar in ASD reflect domain-specific cognitive constraints. Interpreting the 18 discriminators within 12 cognitive-functional domains provides a linguistically grounded perspective on the neurocognitive profile of ASD and offers implications for future diagnostic and intervention research.",

      "title": "Motion feature extraction based on semi-supervised learning and long short-term memory network in digital dance",
      "content": "Digital-image technology has broadened the creative space of dance, yet accurately capturing the semantic correspondence between low-level motion data and high-level dance key-points remains challenging, especially when labeled data are scarce. We aim to establish a lightweight, semi-supervised pipeline that can extract discriminative motion features from depth sequences and map them to 3-D key-points of dancers in real time. To achieve pixel-level alignment between dance movement targets and high-dimensional sensory data, we propose a novel LSTM-CNN (Long Short Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network) framework. Temporal-context features are first extracted by LSTM, after which multi-dimensional spatial features are captured by three convolutional layers and one max-pooling layer; the fused representation is finally regressed to 3-D body key-points. To relieve class imbalance caused by complex postures, an online hard-example mining (OHEM) strategy together with a Dice-cross-entropy weighted loss (3:1) is embedded into semi-supervised learning, enabling the network to converge with only 20% labeled samples. Experiments on the public MSR-Action3D dataset (567 sequences, 20 actions) yielded an average recognition rate of 96.9%, surpassing the best comparison method (MSST) by 1.1%. On our self-established dataset (99 sequences, 11 actions) the accuracy reached 97.99% while training time was reduced by 35% compared with the previous best Multi_perspective_MHPCs approach. Both datasets show low RMSE (\u2264 0.032) between predicted and ground-truth key-points, confirming spatial precision. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reliably track subtle dance gestures under limited annotation, offering an efficient, low-cost solution for digital choreography, motion-style transfer and interactive stage performance.",

      "content": "The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, known for its governance of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, has attracted newfound interest due to its role in maintaining bodily homeostasis in various tissue types. Sympathetic activity in the skin is often perturbed in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, aberrant changes in the sympathetic skin response can be detected before clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy. Furthermore, sympathetic signaling at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle has now been demonstrated to be critical for synapse integrity and proper functioning. Insufficient sympathetic signaling in skeletal muscle underlies the pathogenesis of muscle weakness in several disease states, such as myasthenia syndromes and sarcopenia. Additionally, surgical sympathectomies, a treatment method for conditions that involve heightened sympathetic activity, can give rise to other unwanted side effects, prompting the need for sympathetic trunk reconstruction. Therefore, the sympathetic nervous system, with renewed appreciation of its known functions and developing excitement for its recently discovered functions, remains a source for a wealth of potential discoveries that can further enable us to improve human health.",

      "title": "Sleep regulation in Drosophila: a review of neural circuits and genetics",
      "content": "Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a complex and distributed network of neural circuits that are influenced by factors such as internal state, circadian timing, and prior experiences. While no single \u201csleep center\u201d has been identified, key brain regions\u2014including the central complex, the mushroom bodies, and other associative structures\u2014such as ventral nerve cord (VNC) contribute to the modulation of sleep and wakefulness. The roles of these regions appear to be dynamic, context-dependent, and often overlapping, reflecting the multifaceted nature of sleep regulation. At the circuit level, mechanisms such as changes in neuronal firing patterns, neurotransmitter systems (e.g., octopamine, dopamine, GABA), and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity have been shown to regulate sleep-wake cycles. On a molecular scale, a variety of genes\u2014including shaker, fruitless, and GAT\u2014influence sleep regulation through distinct pathways, with perturbations in these genes resulting in significant alterations in sleep duration, architecture, and homeostatic regulation. Recent studies, particularly those utilizing Drosophila sleep mutants, have provided valuable insights into the genetic and circuit-level interactions that govern sleep homeostasis and its coordination with the circadian system. These findings underscore sleep as an emergent property of interacting neural and genetic networks, providing a robust model for understanding the mechanisms of sleep in more complex organisms. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in Drosophila sleep research, with a focus on neural structures and the genetic basis of sleep regulation.",

      "content": "IntroductionSubthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a standard-of-care (SoC) treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD); however, how therapeutic DBS influences motor output is incompletely understood. Specifically, the extent of electromyographic (EMG) modulation during DBS at therapeutic (or SoC) amplitude and its relationship to activity state could be better characterized.MethodsWe studied the effects of DBS on muscle activity in sixteen participants receiving STN-DBS (in 17 stimulated hemispheres) by recording EMG activity in bilateral biceps, triceps, flexor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum communis muscles. Data was acquired in the resting state and while participants alternated between isometric contraction and brief relaxation. We recorded EMG activity during low-frequency stimulation at participant-specific therapeutic amplitude and during stimulation using pulse amplitudes slightly above (125%) and below (75%) this level. Stimulus-locked responses from each condition were evaluated for the presence of a myogenic evoked potential.ResultsDBS at therapeutic amplitude elicited a myogenic response almost exclusively in the contralateral upper extremity (CUE), with at least one response occurring in 16 out of 17 hemispheres. Myogenic responses, which typically started between 10-30 milliseconds and often lasted until ~70-150 milliseconds post-stimulation, were more common in biceps/triceps. Responses were more prevalent during active contraction compared to relax/rest states as stimulation amplitude increased.DiscussionThese findings support that STN-DBS-induced myogenic activity is commonplace at therapeutic stimulation amplitudes used clinically; thus, studies evaluating the degree to which myogenic effects during SoC STN DBS are associated with the clinical and side effects of STN DBS therapy are warranted.",

Among its subtypes, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the most common, affecting around 1\u20132 individuals per million inhabitants yearly. In 2005, Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Health (MH) initiated a surveillance program for CJD, creating a protocol to report the cases. Despite advances, the MH still struggles to make a reliable database to determine PrD profile in Brazil. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the Brazilian PrD surveillance system.MethodsThis is a retrospective and descriptive study based on the epidemiological records of CJD surveillance from 2005 to 2021 in the Ministry of Health\u2019s Epidemiological Bulletin published in 2022.Results1,576 suspected cases of CJD were reported, concentrated in the Southeast, South and Northeast regions of Brazil. Among the notifications, the following age groups predominated: 55\u201374 years (60.2%), 45\u201354 years (15%), and 75\u201385 years (11.8%). Suspected cases were mainly represented by women (53.6%), white individuals (61.4%), and residents of urban areas (90%). 547 cases (34.7%) were confirmed based on the following confirmation criteria: laboratory (65.6%), clinical-epidemiological (29.4%), and not informed (4.9%).ConclusionIn this period, the expected number of cases for the Brazilian population would be 3,200. Additionally to underreporting, the data shared by MH is limited due to the use of a database destined to mainly observe epidemic outbreaks and mismatches between official documents. Despite some progress since 2005, PrD surveillance in Brazil faces significant problems, due to the inaccurate treatment of these data and the lack of a specific database for CJD.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
