      "title": "Domain-specific decoupling of co-chaperone and ligase functions in STUB1 underlies biochemical and clinical heterogeneity in SCA48",
      "content": "The carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP, encoded by STUB1) integrates co-chaperone and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities to maintain proteostasis. Heterozygous STUB1 mutations cause the dominant cerebellar ataxia SCA48 through incompletely understood mechanisms. We characterized 13 SCA48-associated variants in the TPR and U-box domains using recombinant protein and cellular assays. TPR mutations retained intrinsic ligase activity but lost HSC70 binding, substrate ubiquitination efficiency, and protein stability. Conversely, U-box mutations abolished ligase function, induced aberrant high-molecular-weight oligomerization, and frequently elevated steady-state CHIP levels while only partially impairing co-chaperone activity. Many variants exhibited temperature-sensitive defects and stress-induced nuclear mislocalization. Principal component analysis revealed robust domain-specific biochemical clustering. RNA-seq following STUB1 knockdown demonstrated preserved HSF1-dependent transactivation but a loss of CHIP-dependent amplification of ubiquitination, chaperone, and transcriptional pathways under heat stress. Meta-analysis of 87 SCA48 patients linked TPR-like biochemical profiles to upper motor neuron involvement and U-box profiles to prominent dysarthria. Collectively, SCA48 mutations decouple CHIPs dual functions in a domain-dependent manner, exerting dominant-negative or gain-of-toxic effects that drive the observed clinical heterogeneity. These findings establish a direct biochemical-clinical correlation in SCA48 and provide a framework for domain-targeted therapeutic strategies exploiting residual ligase or chaperone activity.",

      "title": "Interleaving cortex-analog mixing improves deep non-negative matrix factorization networks",
      "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

      "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",
