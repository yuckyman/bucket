      "title": "KF/parabrachial complex PACAP - glutamate pathway to the extended amygdala couples rapid autonomic and delayed endocrine responses to acute hypotension",
      "content": "The calyx of Held is a giant axo-somatic synapse classically confined to the auditory brainstem. We recently identified morphologically similar calyx-like terminals in the extended amygdala (EA) that arise from the ventrolateral parabrachial complex and co-express PACAP, CGRP, VAChT, VGluT1, and VGluT2, targeting PKCdelta+/GluD1+ EA neurons. Here we asked whether this parabrachial - EA pathway participates in compensation during acute hypotension. In rats given hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we quantified Fos protein during an early phase (60 min) and a late phase (120 min). Early after hypotension, Fos surged in a discrete subpopulation of the parabrachial Kolliker - Fuse (KF) region and in the EA, whereas magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON/PVN) remained largely silent. By 120 min, magnocellular SON/PVN neurons were robustly Fos-positive. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed that most Fos+ PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons were encircled by PACAP+ perisomatic terminals (80.8%), of which the majority co-expressed VGluT1 (88.1%). RNAscope in situ hybridization further identified a selective KF population co-expressing Adcyap1 (PACAP) and Slc17a7 (VGluT1) that became Fos-positive during the early phase. Together these data indicate that a KFPACAP/VGluT1 projection forms calyceal terminals around PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons, providing a high-fidelity route for rapid autonomic rebound to falling blood pressure, while slower endocrine support is subsequently recruited via vasopressinergic magnocellular activation. This work links multimodal parabrachial output to temporally layered autonomic - neuroendocrine control.",

      "title": "Brain-Wide Subnetworks within and between Naturally Socializing Typical and Autism Model Mice",
      "content": "Social interaction is inherently asymmetric, requiring coordinated activity between non-homologous brain regions across individuals. However, the brain-wide dynamics underlying such inter-brain coordination remain poorly understood. We used multi-fiber photometry to simultaneously record from 24 brain regions in pairs of freely interacting mice, including a model of autism. Social interactions evoked widespread, dynamic activity across brains, with inter-brain synchrony, especially between non-homologous areas, exceeding intra-brain synchrony, particularly in dominant mice. Network analysis revealed three subnetworks: (1) Emotional, intra-brain enhanced in subordinates; (2) Sensory, spanning both mice; (3) Decision/consolidation, linking dominant prefrontal cortex to subordinate hippocampus. These subnetworks encoded dominance, identity, and interaction roles, and followed a clear temporal sequence around social events. In an autism model, socially evoked activity was hyperactive displaying mostly within brain synchrony but lacked inter-brain synchrony. Our results uncover dynamic inter-brain circuits as a hallmark of social behavior and reveal their disruption in autism.",

      "title": "Sustained alpha oscillations serve attentional prioritization in working memory, not maintenance",
      "content": "Recent theory on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has attributed an important role to \"activity-silent\" mechanisms, suggesting that sustained neural activity might not be essential in the retention of information. This idea has been challenged by reports of ongoing neural activity in the alpha band during WM maintenance, however. The precise role of these alpha oscillations is unclear: Do they reflect attentional prioritization of stored information, or do they serve as a general maintenance mechanism, for instance to periodically refresh synaptic traces? To address this, we designed a visual WM task involving two memory items, one of which was prioritized for recall. The task included both a short (1 s) and a long (3 s) delay intervals between encoding and retrieval. The long delay was implemented to provide a more decisive test of WM maintenance, providing a point in time when any initially silent synaptic traces would likely need to be refreshed as well. Time-resolved decoding analyses revealed that both prioritized and deprioritized items were initially decodable following stimulus presentation. However, only the prioritized item exhibited sustained decodability throughout the delay, particularly in the long delay condition, where it transitioned into a stable coding scheme. This prolonged representation was selectively supported by induced alpha power, which reliably tracked the prioritized item, but not the deprioritized one. Impulse-based decoding further confirmed this asymmetry, highlighting a selective reactivation of the deprioritized item only upon contextual relevance. Together, these findings suggest that sustained alpha-band activity reflects attentional prioritization, rather than general memory maintenance. Unattended, non-prioritized items appear to transition into an activity-silent state, consistent with models of synaptic storage in WM.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Assessment of Fluorescence Stability Shows Fluorescence Intensity Decreases Over Time: Implications for Fluorescence Microscopy Studies",
      "content": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most widely used techniques across basic, translational, and clinical sciences. Key considerations need to be made to achieve reliable and robust IHC staining, however what has been understudied is the stability of IHC signal intensity over time. Changes in signal intensity over time have significant implications for data analysis and interpretation and ultimately impact scientific conclusions. In order to explore changes in IHC signal, the stability of fluorescence intensity was assessed over the course of six weeks using widefield or confocal microscopy. Results indicate that fluorescence intensity can decrease over this time course and that whether this decrease occurs and to what extent is influenced by the selection of the primary antibody as well as that of the secondary antibody, primary-secondary antibody combination, and utilization of chemical staining versus IHC staining. This investigation reinforces best practices for imaging fluorescent staining to ensure accurate and reliable data collection, be it for cell counting, assessing protein expression levels, or marker colocalization.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

      "title": "Functional evidence for early origin of tactile acuity in the vertebrate somatosensory system",
      "content": "Mammals and reptiles possess a sophisticated somatosensory system for precise tactile discrimination via mechanosensory end-organs, such as Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles and others. These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",
