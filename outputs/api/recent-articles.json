      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

      "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

      "content": "BackgroundMultifocal transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) has emerged as an innovative approach for modulating cognitive functions by concurrently targeting multiple brain regions. Despite its potential, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of this technique remain unclear.ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of multifocal tES in enhancing cognitive function by examining targeted brain regions, stimulation protocols, and behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted up to February 10, 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The inclusion criteria encompassed human studies utilizing concurrent dual-site or multifocal tES with pre- and post-intervention behavioral assessments. Studies on deep brain stimulation, corticocortical paired associative stimulation, sequential stimulation, case reports, and reviews were excluded.ResultsOf the 1,453 initial records, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The studies predominantly employed transcranial direct current stimulation/transcranial alternating current stimulation, targeting the frontoparietal network. Neurophysiological data from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed network-level modulations. Behavioral outcomes were inconsistent, with some studies reporting improvements in executive function, working memory, and response inhibition, whereas others showed no significant advantages over sham stimulation.ConclusionAlthough multifocal tES is a promising modality, clearly determining its efficacy is currently limited by heterogeneous study designs, small sample sizes, and conflicting findings. Future research should prioritize multi-arm trials, incorporate neurophysiological biomarkers, and develop personalized stimulation protocols to optimize the effectiveness of this technique.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration # CRD420250646196.",

      "title": "Perceptual learning improves spatial contrast sensitivity in older adults",
      "content": "IntroductionWidespread visual deficits accompany normal aging, with most attributed to functional degradation of the visual cortex. Although perceptual learning can improve many visual functions in older adults, it remains unclear whether it can enhance spatial contrast sensitivity, a fundamental visual function known to decline significantly from around age forty.MethodsTo address this, we trained 29 older adults and 18 young controls using contrast perceptual learning. Training was conducted at seven spatial frequencies (from low to high) and/or at the individual cut-off spatial frequency. Spatial contrast sensitivity function (SCSF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured before and after training.ResultsTraining induced substantial improvements in both SCSF and VA in older adults, which were retained for at least several months. Analysis of transfer effects revealed that, compared to young controls, older adults exhibited a characteristic low-frequency shift in peak improvement and a slightly broader bandwidth.DiscussionThese results may be associated with age-related alterations in neuronal response properties within the primary visual cortex. Our findings demonstrate substantial neural plasticity in the aging visual system and support the potential of perceptual learning as a clinically viable intervention for mitigating age-related visual decline.",

      "title": "Contribution of binocular visual function and its impairment by Bangerter foils to the performance of a precision reaching, grasping and placing task in healthy adults",
      "content": "BackgroundUpper limb movement execution is affected in patients with vision impairments resulting from ocular pathologies or binocular anomalies. Deficits in motor performance have been correlated with reduced contrast sensitivity, phoria, and stereoacuity.AimTo evaluate the effects of increased straylight induced by Bangerter foils on binocular visual function and examine the corresponding impact on eye-hand kinematics during a high precision reaching, grasping and placement task (i.e., bead threading).MethodsTwenty-one healthy participants, aged 21\u201341\u202fyears, participated in this experimental study. Visual function assessment included visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), stereoacuity (SA), phoria, and fusional vergences (FV). Vision was impaired experimentally using Bangerter foils 0.4. Participants performed a bead threading task under three randomized viewing conditions: binocular baseline (BB; normal vision), binocular viewing with a foil over the dominant eye (FDE), and foils over both eyes (FBE). Eye and hand movements were recorded using an eye tracker and a motion capture camera.ResultsVisual functions (VA, CS, and stereoacuity) were impaired when viewing with the Bangerter foils. Pairwise comparison between viewing conditions confirmed statistically significant differences between BB, FDE and FBE for mid to high spatial frequencies (6, 12 and 18\u202fcycles per degree; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Break points for positive and negative fusional reserves were impaired when interocular differences increased (i.e., FDE condition). The impairment did not have any impact on phoria. Results from the kinematic analysis revealed threading duration was prolonged using Bangerter foils on both eyes (FBE condition). In contrast to the hypothesis, visual deficit due to foils did not affect any other kinematic measures. However, results from mixed model analyses revealed that individual differences in phoria and fusional vergence had the most significant influence on reaching performance. Specifically, a larger exophoria magnitude was associated with longer reach duration, lower peak velocity and prolonged total time to complete the task (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionInducing short-term deterioration through the alteration of contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies without a clinical deterioration in stereopsis does not have a significant impact on precision grasping and placing movements, in a repetitive manual task. Notably, this study demonstrated that phoria impacts the execution of reaching movements.",

      "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
      "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

      "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant mental and physical burden on patients, markedly diminishing their quality of life. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive functions, mood state, sleep function, and overal quality of life in individuals with PD.MethodsRelevant literature was sourced from multiple databases, ultimately including 22 studies with a total of 1324 individuals. Data analysis was conducted using meta-analysis software. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024599943).ResultsThe findings indicated that tDCS significantly enhanced cognitive function, alleviated anxiety and depression, increased sleep duration, improved sleep efficiency, reduced arousal index, and ameliorated daytime sleepiness, while also enhancing activities of daily living. However, discrepancies were noted across various assessment scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Cognitive Rating Scale, delayed recall metrics, sleep scales, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire. Additionally, individuals with PD displayed good tolerance to tDCS.ConclusionOverall, tDCS shows promise in improving non-motor symptoms and enhancing quality of life for individuals with PD.

      "title": "Regional abnormalities in the hippocampus and verbal memory impairment in craniofacial dystonia",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with craniofacial dystonia (CFD) often present with verbal memory deficits, but their neuroanatomical basis is not yet clear. This study aims to determine whether verbal memory deficits in CFD are associated with structural atrophy of specific hippocampal subfields, and to isolate dystonia-specific pathological changes through comparison with patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS).MethodsWe recruited 50 patients with CFD, 48 patients with HFS, and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Verbal memory and global cognitive function were assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Volumes of hippocampal subfields were quantified from high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using FreeSurfer. Group comparisons were performed after controlling for relevant covariates.ResultsWhile global cognition (MMSE) scores did not differ significantly among groups, patients with CFD demonstrated significant verbal memory deficits. Compared with HCs, they performed worse across immediate, short-, and long-delay recall trials, with medium-to-large effect sizes (all P-FDR \u2264 0.002; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.70 to \u22120.82). Similar deficits of medium effect sizes were observed when compared with patients with HFS (all P-FDR \u2264 0.027; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.49 to \u22120.52). Crucially, patients with HFS were unimpaired relative to HCs, establishing this memory deficit as specific to the dystonia pathophysiology. The imaging analysis revealed that patients with CFD were associated with significant atrophy in the left granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) (P-FDR = 0.014; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.58) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.010; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.60) compared with HCs, and with significant atrophy in the right GC-DG (P-FDR = 0.032; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.52) and CA4 (P-FDR = 0.041; Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.50) compared with HCs. However, the magnitude of the atrophy showed no significant correlation with verbal memory scores, disease duration, or motor severity, revealing a critical structure-function dissociation.ConclusionOur findings reveal a structure-function dissociation in CFD. We propose its verbal memory deficits, despite hippocampal atrophy, may stem from broader network dysfunction or microstructural pathology not seen on conventional MRI. This challenges models assuming a direct link between macrostructural atrophy and cognitive symptoms.",

      "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
      "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

      "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
      "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",
