      "title": "Evidence for separate processes underlying movement and decision vigor in a reward-oriented task",
      "content": "The vigor of movement and decision-making is fundamental to many reward-oriented behaviors. While some theories propose that movement and decision are jointly invigorated to maximize a global utility (e.g., mixing reward, effort, and time), alternative perspectives suggest that the brain can separately invigorate them when advantageous. We tested these competing hypotheses using a foraging-like task that allowed experimentally assessing the vigor of movement (reaching to reward location) and that of decision-making (harvesting reward). By using a block-wise design, we measured the effects of independent manipulations of time and effort on reach and harvest durations. Decoupled effects were found on reach and harvest durations, with no inter-individual consistency between them. A model that separately optimized movement and decision vigor predicted these results better than a global utility model. These findings support the separate control hypothesis, indicating that distinct time-cost signals (sensitive to recent temporal history) may invigorate movement and decision. We conclude that movement and decision vigor is only indirectly linked, with any apparent co-regulation arising when both are governed by a shared temporal signal reflecting a common cost of time.",

      "title": "Encoding without generation in the medial prefrontal cortex during cautious goal-directed actions",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires flexibly initiating or withholding actions in response to threat-predictive cues, often balancing urgency with cautious delay. Although dorsomedial, including prelimbic, prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been widely implicated in this control, the specific role of GABAergic neurons remains unclear. We combined fiber photometry and single-cell calcium imaging in mice performing cued tasks of increasing complexity to examine how PFC GABAergic neurons encode task variables, including relative to a comparison region, visual cortex (VI). Mixed-effects modeling showed that movement and baseline activity were dominant predictors of neural activity in both regions, but PFC neurons additionally encoded punished outcomes broadly and correct action generation or deferment only under challenging contexts. Single-cell analyses revealed subsets selectively modulated at cue onset or action generation. Yet broad optogenetic inhibition of PFC or VI produced similarly minimal effects on learning or performance across tasks, indicating that PFC encoding does not reflect behavioral control.",

      "title": "Hippocampal network activity changes during early epileptogenesis predict subsequent epilepsy",
      "content": "The circuit mechanisms underlying focal epileptogenesis are, despite of decades of epilepsy research, still incompletely understood. In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes in hippocampal network activity induced by a potentially epileptogenic insult. In rats, long-lasting electrical perforant pathway stimulation leads in a high percentage of animals to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, a subset of animals remains resilient against the stimulation. We monitored alterations of neuronal activity by chronically recording the local field potential (LFP) from the hippocampal dentate gyrus before, during and after the potentially epileptogenic insult. Intriguingly, epilepsy animals identified by subsequent spontaneous epileptic seizures were characterized by a transient increase in the aperiodic exponent suggesting a shift towards a reduced local excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio during the first days after the perforant path stimulation. Furthermore, these animals developed a strong impairment of theta oscillation prevalence and regularity during early epileptogenesis. In contrast, resilient non-epilepsy animals without spontaneous seizures neither showed this modulation in E/I ratio nor a corruption of hippocampal theta activity. In fact, the increase in the aperiodic exponent on the first day after completion of the electrical stimulation paradigm could predict epileptogenesis with very high fidelity (AUC 0.92) and correlated significantly with later seizure rate. This finding opens the opportunity to dissect mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to test the effectiveness of anti-epileptogenesis treatment in very early disease stages by allowing identification of individuals at high risk. Furthermore, it might offer a potential explanation for the frequently observed failure of anti-epileptogenesis drugs boosting GABAergic inhibition.",

      "title": "A developmentally inspired computational model of face recognition that learns continuously through generative memory replay",
      "content": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have emerged as powerful models for human face recognition, capturing several hallmark behavioral phenomena such as the face inversion effect and the other-race effect. Yet, key differences remain between how DCNNs and humans, particularly infants, learn to recognize faces. In this study, we present a developmentally-inspired model that addresses three critical gaps between humans and standard DCNNs: (1) DCNNs are trained via one-time batch learning, whereas infants encounter faces gradually over time; (2) DCNNs are trained on thousands of face images with high variability of static images for each identity, while infants are initially exposed to a small number of identities, often limited to close caregivers, through a continuous, dynamic stream of visual input with lower within-identity variability; (3) The goal of DCNNs is to recognize untrained (unfamiliar) faces, while the goal of human face system is to recognize familiar faces. To better approximate developmental face learning, we introduce a model comprising three interacting modules: an Embedder - a DCNN trained to encode face identity continually on up to 10 identities, based on images taken from videos of a TV series; an Autoencoder used for generative memory-replay, to construct images of missing identities in each training phase; and a Memory module - stores identity-specific latent codes. Results show that this model achieves recognition performance comparable to batch-trained DCNNs. We propose this new model as a framework for studying the developmental and mature mechanisms of human face recognition.",

      "title": "Modulatory Effects of the Motor Imagery and Jendrassik Maneuver upon the Forearm H-Reflex and Electroencephalographic Activity",
      "content": "While the Jendrassik maneuver (JM) is commonly used in neurology to enhance monosynaptic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reflex, its interaction with cognitive processes like motor imagery (MI) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of JM, MI, and their combination on the left flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex and cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Twenty healthy participants completed four tasks: resting, MI (imagining squeezing a tennis ball with the left hand), JM (squeezing a tennis ball with the right hand), and JM combined with MI (JM&amp;MI). The FCR H-reflex was elicited with median nerve stimulation, and EEG changes were analyzed through event-related potentials and modulations of the mu rhythm. Surprisingly, JM performed with the right hand did not affect the contralateral H-reflex. MI of the left hand decreased the H-reflex in the right FCR. JM and MI significantly modulated cortical activity. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu-rhythm occurred during both JM and MI, and it was contralateral to the physical contraction or imagery. Bilateral ERD was observed during JM&amp;MI. Cortical responses to nerve stimulation (P100, N100 and P300 components) varied by task, and during JM the P100 and P300 components correlated with strength of mu-rhythm ERD.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "Balancing Efficiency and Compensation: Age-related Theta and Alpha Dynamics in High-load Working Memory",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) declines with age, yet older adults often preserve performance through compensatory mechanisms. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta and alpha bands are central to these adaptations, but their distinct roles across maintenance, manipulation, and recall remain unclear. We examined behavioural and neural differences in WM using electroencephalography (EEG) during verbal (Letter Span) and visuospatial (Corsi Block) tasks under retention and manipulation conditions. Behaviourally, older adults preserved performance in the Letter Span but showed deficits in the Corsi Test, suggesting domain-specific declines, while higher task demands reduced accuracy across both groups. At the neural level, younger adults exhibited stronger mid-frontal and temporal theta activity, supporting more efficient recruitment of WM processes and stronger performance associations. Older adults showed attenuated theta power, indicative of neural saturation, and appeared to compensate through alpha-mediated mechanisms during the delay period (maintenance/manipulation): reduced alpha suppression in the Letter Span facilitated rehearsal and updating, whereas increased upper alpha in the Corsi Test protected stored visuospatial information. These findings suggest theta oscillations underpin core WM functions, whereas alpha oscillations flexibly support compensatory strategies in ageing.",
