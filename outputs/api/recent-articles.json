      "title": "From movement to cognitive maps: recurrent neural networks reveal how locomotor development shapes hippocampal spatial coding",
      "content": "The hippocampus contains neurons whose firing correlates with an animal's location and orientation in space. Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.",

      "title": "Type 2 diabetes Reprograms Bone Marrow Hematopoiesis and Dysregulates Immune Signaling in Response to Stroke",
      "content": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.",

      "title": "Kilohertz-rate two-photon voltage imaging of population dynamics in vivo",
      "content": "Understanding how neural circuits compute requires capturing voltage dynamics across large neuronal populations with millisecond resolution in vivo. However, two-photon voltage imaging remains fundamentally limited by a trade-off among imaging speed, field of view, and excitation efficiency. We introduce HS2PM, a hybrid scanning two-photon microscope that overcomes this bottleneck, enabling kilohertz-rate imaging over a 650x524 m2 field of view at single-cell resolution while preserving the photon efficiency of single-point excitation. HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. It resolves both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in vivo, revealing how these jointly shape sensory adaptation and population coding. Beyond voltage imaging, HS2PM supports high-speed fluorescence lifetime and vascular flow imaging, establishing a multimodal platform for dissecting fast circuit dynamics with precision previously inaccessible to optical methods.",

      "title": "Decoding medial entorhinal cortical dynamics produces planning-like alternations in hippocampal theta sequences",
      "content": "The hippocampus plays a central role in memory and spatial planning. In rodents, theta oscillations (7-12Hz) are associated with active navigation and appear necessary for planning and spatial memory. A key neural mechanism held to support navigational decision making are theta sequences - brief (~120ms) sequential activations of hippocampal place cells representing trajectories ahead of the animal. Evidence for their role in planning includes their tendency to sample potential future paths at decision points, particularly the left-right sequences observed along the T-maze arms during alternation tasks. However, a recent study challenges this interpretation, proposing that the natural tendency of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) theta sequences to alternate between leftward and rightward directions might account for the apparent sampling of arms on the T-maze. Given that MEC inputs drive hippocampal activity, this raises the possibility that hippocampal alternations in T-mazes simply reflect intrinsic MEC dynamics rather than active planning. Here, we test this hypothesis by modelling MEC theta sequences in a T-shaped maze and demonstrate that standard Bayesian decoding produces hippocampal theta sequences alternating between maze arms, consistent with experimental observations. Analysis of simultaneous MEC-hippocampal recordings reveals that MEC alternation consistently precedes hippocampus by ~50ms, suggesting a feedforward, state-independent mechanism. This coordinated MEC-hippocampal left-right alternation occurs not only at choice points but also during inbound trials (where no deliberate choice is required) and at forced-turn corners (where only one path exists). These findings suggest that left-right alternation in hippocampal theta sequences is a ubiquitous phenomenon driven by MEC dynamics, challenging the interpretation that these specifically reflect intentional decision-making or planning processes.",
