      "title": "Data-driven identification of functional networks in artificial and biological neural networks",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain represents information is a central challenge in neuroscience and a practical bottleneck for brain-computer interfaces. Existing analytical tools cannot identify neural representations directly from neural activity data. We introduce MultiPEC, a data-driven method that discovers neural representations by quantifying how sets of signals jointly reduce context prediction error. Applied to artificial neural networks, MultiPEC uncovered class-specific subnetworks whose targeted ablation disproportionately impaired performance, demonstrating their causal role in feature recognition. Applied to EEG recordings from 24 participants, MultiPEC revealed functional signatures of auditory and visual processing. Classification analyses showed that MultiPEC captured fine-grained stimulus submodalities (levels of stimulus meaningfulness) more effectively than broad stimulus domains, highlighting the context-sensitive nature of neural representations. Together, these results establish MultiPEC as a scalable approach for identifying data driven (natural) representations in both biological and artificial systems, with potential applications in adaptive neurotechnology, clinical diagnostics and cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "Brain vasculature is essential for central nervous system function, but its specific roles in synaptic development and motor function regulation are poorly understood. In this study, we identify a cerebrovascular signaling axis wherein endothelial PRMT5 critically regulates inhibitory synaptogenesis and motor coordination. Cerebrovascular-speci[fi]c deletion of Prmt5 gene leads to excessive inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and progressive motor deficits in mice. Mechanistically, PRMT5 deficiency epigenetically upregulates the expression of the secreted factor ANGPTL4 through reduced symmetric dimethylation of H3R8 and H4R3, along with increased H3K9 acetylation at the Angptl4 promoter, thereby driving excessive inhibitory synaptogenesis onto Purkinje cells. Importantly, Angptl4 deletion in brain endothelium normalizes inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and restores motor coordination in PRMT5-deficient mice. Together, these findings define the endothelial PRMT5-ANGPTL4 axis as a key regulator of cerebellar inhibitory circuitry and motor function, highlighting cerebrovascular mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets for motor coordination disorders.",

      "title": "Prenatal valproic acid-exposed autism marmosets increase mutual gaze and reduce inter-individual distance during dyadic social interactions",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social interaction. While most assessments of ASD remain individual-centric, dyad-level evaluation may reveal features not apparent in individual profiling. We examined dyadic coordination in a non-human primate ASD model under experimentally controlled yet naturalistic conditions. Markerless pose estimation was used to quantify frame-by-frame gaze behavior and inter-individual distance during first encounters between unfamiliar common marmosets. Dyads with a prenatal valproic acid-exposed animal and an unexposed partner (VPA-UE) were compared with unexposed controls (UE-UE). VPA-UE pairs showed a higher proportion and greater number of mutual gaze episodes, whereas overall gaze shift was similar across groups. VPA marmosets made fewer unreciprocated looks; however, when the partner looked at them, they more often returned the look within 1 s, indicating heightened gaze reactivity. VPA-UE dyads maintained shorter inter-individual distances, and the closer proximity destabilized mutual gaze more strongly than in UE-UE dyads. These findings indicate a distinct dyadic-coordination pattern in VPA-UE pairs: rapid responsiveness combined with reduced tolerance for close spacing, consistent with distance-dependent differences rather than a global deficit in social motivation. This dyad-centric markerless framework provides scalable, ecologically grounded measures and intervention targets that leverage intact responsiveness while accommodating altered spatial coordination.",

      "title": "Show HN: RowboatX \u2013 open-source Claude Code for everyday automations",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN!<p>Claude Code is great, but it\u2019s focused on coding. The missing piece is a native way to build and run custom background agents for non-code tasks. We built RowboatX as a CLI tool modeled after Claude Code that lets you do that. It uses the file system and unix tools to create and monitor background agents for everyday tasks, connect them to any MCP server for tools, and reason over their outputs.<p>Because RowboatX runs locally with shell access, the agents can install tools, execute code, and automate anything you could do in a terminal with your explicit permission. It works with any compatible LLM, including open-source ones.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a>, and there\u2019s a demo video here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cyPBinQzicY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/cyPBinQzicY</a><p>For example, you can connect RowboatX to the ElevenLabs MCP server and create a background workflow that produces a NotebookLM-style podcast every day from recent AI-agent papers on arXiv. Or you can connect it to Google Calendar and Exa Search to research meeting attendees and generate briefs before each event.<p>You can try these with: `npx @rowboatlabs/rowboatx`<p>We combined three simple ideas:<p>1. File system as state: Each agent\u2019s instruction, memory, logs, and data are just files on disk, grepable, diffable, and local. For instance, you can just run: grep -rl '\"agent\":\"\"' ~/.rowboat/runs to list every run for a particular workflow.<p>2. The supervisor agent: A Claude Code style agent that can create and run background agents. It predominantly uses Unix commands to monitor, update, and schedule agents. LLMs handle Unix tools better than backend APIs [1][2], so we leaned into that. It can also probe any MCP server and attach the tools to the agents.<p>3. Human-in-the-loop: Each background agent can emit a human_request message when needed (e.g. drafting a tricky email or installing a tool) that pauses execution and waits for input before continuing. The supervisor coordinates this.<p>I started my career over a decade ago building spam detection models at Twitter, spending a lot of my time in the terminal with Unix commands for data analysis [0] and Vowpal Wabbit for modeling. When Claude Code came along, it felt familiar and amazing to work with. But trying to use it beyond code always felt a bit forced. We built RowboatX to bring that same workflow to everyday tasks. It is Apache-2.0 licensed and easily extendable.<p>While there are many agent builders, running on the user's terminal enables unique use cases like computer and browser automation that cloud-based tools can't match. This power requires careful safety design. We implemented command-level allow/deny lists, with containerization coming next. We\u2019ve tried to design for safety from day one, but we\u2019d love to hear the community\u2019s perspective on what additional safeguards or approaches you\u2019d consider important here.<p>We\u2019re excited to share RowboatX with everyone here. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!<p>\u2014<p>[0] <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06807\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06807</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10132\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10132</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45970338\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45970338</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Cognitive and brain function enhancement in Gen X group after personalized, AI supervised EEG-neurofeedback training",
      "content": "Background: Interventions supporting medical care and enhancing quality of life in neurodegenerative or age-related cognitive decline are strongly needed. Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback can enable users to modulate their brain activity through real-time feedback. However, evidence for its clinical effectiveness remains inconclusive, partly due to limited personalization and insufficient task relevance in existing protocols. Objective: We tested whether personalized EEG neurofeedback supervised by deep neural networks (DNNs) can enhance cognitive performance in older adults. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults aged 41 to 64 (31 women), including a sham-feedback control group, completed a personalized neurofeedback protocol with DNNs fine-tuned to individual EEG patterns. The procedure included pre- and post-training assessments using a transitive reasoning task, three diagnostic sessions to adapt the DNN to each participant, and 10 neurofeedback sessions based on a gamified delayed-match-to-sample paradigm. Results: The training group showed robust gains across all three variants of the reasoning task (each p < .01), whereas the sham group improved only on the easiest variant. Groups did not differ at pretest; however, at posttest the training group outperformed the sham group on all task conditions (each p < .03), showing also a larger neural effort (lower alpha band power) and increased beta and gamma band connectivity (higher phase lag index). Conclusion: Personalized, task-oriented neurofeedback guided by individually fine-tuned DNNs can produce cognitive enhancement after relatively few sessions. The proposed Task-Pretrained, Subject-Finetuned Neurofeedback (TPSF-NF) framework is scalable to other cognitive domains in future research.",
