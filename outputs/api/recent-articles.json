      "title": "Simultaneous Triple Modes of Cross-Frequency Coupling in Brainstem Nonlinear Oscillator Networks: Cooperative Rhythms of Respiration, Heartbeat, and Brainwaves",
      "content": "Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism mediating communication between neuronal assemblies through rhythmic interactions across multiple frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Recent findings suggest that slow harmonics in the delta and theta ranges within the brainstem underlie cardiorespiratory rhythms through phase-phase CFC (Kawai, 2023). In contrast, higher-frequency gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) convey information-rich signals via phase-amplitude CFC mechanisms. To date, triple CFC modes have not been characterized in any brain region. Notably, simultaneous delta-theta-gamma coupling-encompassing both phase-phase and phase-amplitude interactions-appears to operate cooperatively, suggesting functional integration through emergent synchrony within the brainstem. Multiple recordings from the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) demonstrate that the power and coherence of these synchronized oscillations exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns along the dorsoventral axis, reflecting differentiation among large-scale efferent systems and cytoarchitectural domains (Kawai, 2018a; Negishi and Kawai, 2011). Robust gamma activity, phase-coupled with delta and theta oscillations generated by resilient harmonic oscillators within the NTS and the broader brainstem network, may constitute a cooperative mechanism for large-scale homeostatic regulation. The dynamic balance of signal power between slow (delta/theta) and fast (gamma) components could nonlinearly modulate oscillator network dynamics and widespread projection systems throughout the brain. Such integrative neural dynamics likely support adaptive, whole-body responses to fluctuations in the interoceptive environment.",

      "content": "Stimulus-selective stopping extends the standard stop signal task by occasionally presenting an \"ignore signal\" instead of a stop signal, in which case participants are instructed to continue responding to the go signal. Here we present several model classes that are based on the idea that responses observed under an ignore signal are the result of a probabilistic mixture from the processing distributions of the go and the ignore signal. Earlier work ensures that the mixture hypothesis is statistically testable. We derive quantitative predictions and parameter estimation for model classes that differ in the way the mixture is introduced. The results are illustrated with an application to a published dataset for stimulus-selective stopping.",

      "content": "Spatial biology technologies enable high-dimensional profiling within intact tissues, revealing how molecular and cellular organization drives function and disease. As these platforms gain broader adoption, standardized analytical frameworks are needed to ensure data quality and reproducibility. Here, we present an end-to-end pipeline for the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler that simultaneously generates whole-transcriptome and 637-protein measurements from user-defined regions within the same tissue sections. The workflow integrates morphology-guided region selection, quality control, normalization, and multi-modal data interpretation. Applied to formalin-fixed cortical tissues from Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and controls, the framework resolves spatially distinct molecular domains. Transcript and protein signals diverge across amyloid plaque cores and surrounding glial-rich regions, with RNA-protein concordance varying by disease condition, while single-neuron profiling with and without pathogenic tau deposition illustrates protein assay sensitivity. This dataset provides a rigorously validated resource for spatial multi-omic analyses and establishes broadly applicable guidelines for reliable, reproducible profiling of complex tissues.",

      "content": "During the wake-sleep cycle, consciousness waxes and wanes, and this is thought to be reflected in varying levels of integration between brain areas. Recent studies challenged the notion that consciousness is homogeneously present or absent in a brain state, as exemplified by conscious reports found in otherwise unconscious Non-REM sleep. We tested if functional connectivity between neurons varies within brain states in a way compatible with a fluctuating level of consciousness. We examined directed functional connectivity between neurons across the wake-sleep cycle in rats, at a scale of a few seconds. We analyzed patterns of functional connectivity to determine if Non-REM sleep contains epochs in which inter-areal integration is comparable to that observed in wakefulness and REM sleep, and vice versa. This study will potentially reveal if circuit-level connectivity patterns are observed during sleep stages, in line with the presence of an alternation between levels of consciousness not only between but also within brain states.",

      "title": "Shared neural geometries for bilingual semantic representations",
      "content": "The human brain has the remarkable ability to understand and express similar concepts in multiple languages. To understand how it does so, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons during passive listening, directed speaking, and spontaneous conversation, in both English and Spanish, in a small group of balanced bilinguals. We find putative translation neurons, whose responses to equivalent words (e.g., tierra and earth) are correlated. More broadly, however, neurons semantic tunings differed substantially by language, suggesting language-specific neural implementations. Despite this, distances between words neural responses are preserved between the two languages, creating a shared semantic geometry. That geometry was implemented by the same neurons but along distinct readout axes; this difference in readout may help prevent cross-language interference. Shared semantic geometry with distinct readout axes is also observed in mBERT, a multi-language LLM, suggesting this may be a general computational principle for multilingual representation. Together, these results suggest that hippocampus encodes a language-independent internal model for meaning.",

      "content": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator signaling through broadly expressed G protein-coupled receptors. We found that S1P is regulated by alcohol and that S1P receptor agonists reduce alcohol drinking in rodent models. Specifically, we observed that two S1P receptor agonists FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod and ozanimod, and the more brain penetrant S1P1 receptor agonist CYM5442, reduced binge alcohol drinking in the drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm in mice. CYM5442 also reduced drinking in dependent mice in the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor paradigm of dependence-induced increased drinking paired with 2 bottle-choice (CIE-2BC) as well as in non-dependent mice. CYM5442 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in both non-dependent and dependent rats made dependent by vapor exposure, and reduced motivation for alcohol in dependent rats tested in a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. CYM5442 significantly prevented cue-induced reinstatement in alcohol-dependent rats, a model of relapse to alcohol seeking. CYM5442 also reduced intake of non-drug reinforcers, including sucrose, food, water and, to a lesser extent, saccharine. Notably, CYM5442 was less aversive than naltrexone, an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorder that shares a similar broad reducing action on alcohol intake and consummatory behavior. CYM5442 had no effect on loss of righting reflex, alcohol metabolism, motor coordination or spontaneous locomotor activity in rodents. Lastly, gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq revealed that S1P regulates a complex set of genes in the transition to alcohol dependence. Overall, our results establish S1P signaling as a novel therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.",

      "title": "Neural dynamics in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex underlie learning from feedback",
      "content": "Learning often depends on feedback, yet how positive and negative outcomes reorganize target representations to support later memory retrieval remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) acts as a central hub linking learning and retrieval, raising the possibility that it plays a critical role in this process. Here we analysed spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from vlPFC while monkeys performed a multi-cycle object-learning task. During the initial learning cycle, correct and incorrect feedback elicited distinct neural responses in both spiking and LFPs. In particular, positive feedback produced elevated theta power and enhanced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (TG-PAC), associated with sustained suppression of neural spiking. Incorrect feedback induced stronger beta power. Despite comparable levels of object information under both feedback conditions, decoders trained and tested within the same feedback state outperformed those tested across states, revealing feedback-dependent coding formats. State-space analyses further showed that object representations following positive feedback were geometrically closer to those reinstated during later retrieval, indicating that feedback reshapes neural geometry toward retrieval-compatible states. Moreover, these geometric effects were selectively expressed on electrodes showing stronger TG-PAC or beta power, suggesting that oscillatory coordination may regulate how feedback signals are transformed into stable target codes. Together, our results reveal how vlPFC serve as a critical bridge between learning and memory retrieval, with feedback-driven dynamics reorganizing population geometry through rhythmic coordination and bringing successful outcome states closer to future retrieval representations.",

      "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
      "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",
