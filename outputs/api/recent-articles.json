      "title": "Portable quantum-sensor magnetomyography decodes fine hand movements",
      "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact quantum sensors that can measure the magnetic fields generated by muscle activity (magnetomyography, MMG) without skin contact. This contact-free alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) has remained mostly confined to magnetically shielded rooms and simple tasks, limiting translation. Here, we show that a portable OPM-MMG system operated inside a compact magnetic shield can robustly decode fine finger movements and recover EMG-like muscle activation patterns. Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design. Our results show that OPM-MMG in a portable shielded environment preserves task-relevant neuromuscular information and approaches EMG-level structure without skin contact or a magnetically shielded room. Our findings open a path toward hygienic, rapid-setup assessment and human-machine interfacing in clinics and rehabilitation settings.",

      "title": "Task-irrelevant stimuli boost phasic pupil-linked arousal but not memory formation",
      "content": "Brainstem arousal systems, especially the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond transiently to behaviorally relevant events, which is reflected in pupil dilations. The strength of these pupil-linked arousal responses during encoding of stimulus material predicts the success of its later retrieval. The pupil also dilates in response to task-irrelevant sounds. Here, we evaluated whether the effect of task-irrelevant white noise sounds on pupil-linked arousal can also be used to manipulate memory formation. Task-irrelevant white-noise sounds played before, during or after the presentation of memoranda (images or spoken words) evoked robust pupil dilations. Trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude of pupil responses during word encoding also predicted memory success. Yet, the task-irrelevant sounds did not increase memory success. These sounds may not trigger the same central arousal processes as endogenous variations of arousal that are relevant for memory formation, such as those occurring in states of increased emotionality.",

      "title": "Thalamocortical coupling and cortical E-I balance generate diverse anesthetic \u03b1-spindles for interpretable EEG decoding",
      "content": "Anesthesia is a common clinical procedure, yet its hallmark EEG motifs--spindles oscillating in the broad alpha-range between 4 and 16 Hz--are not enough interpretable from the neuronal circuit perspective and for predictive medicine. To fill this gap, we investigate here the neuronal mechanisms and mathematical principles of brain spindles by recording and modeling large-scale thalamo-cortical neuronal ensembles in mice under anesthesia. We report irregular weakly synchronized firing of thalamic and cortical neurons associated with spindle patterns, indicating an emergent network rather than cellular dynamics. The consecutive loss of balance between the firing of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons and the increased firing fluctuations, together play in favor of larger spindle amplitude. In addition, the continuous range of spindle frequencies observed reflects a tight equilibrium of interactions between the thalamus and cortex. To create a possible numerical twin of this complex dynamics that could be used during clinical anesthesia, we built a computational model that comprises a reciprocally connected excitatory and inhibitory representation of cortical and thalamic networks driven by random fluctuations. The model parsimoniously explains the changes in spindle dynamics when increasing the anesthesia dose. This model thus links in vivo brain sub-network dynamics with EEG for the readout of anesthetized brain states.",

      "title": "Empathy Accelerates Subjective Time Perception, Independent of Physiology but Not of Visual Attention",
      "content": "Recent work suggests that empathic engagement can influence cognitive and perceptual processes, yet its impact on time perception remains unclear. Whereas internal clock models would predict that empathy-induced physiological arousal lengthen perceived duration, other frameworks offer opposite predictions. Specifically, findings that empathy reduces perceived distance, combined with construal level, and motivational dimensional theory, together predict that empathy accelerate the subjective passage of time. Moreover, although eye-movements are crucial in empathy, it remains unclear how visual attention modulates time perception during empathic experiences. Thus, we employed an empathy-for-pain and duration estimation task, while measuring participants heart rate, skin conductance, and eye-movements, to investigate how empathy and physiological arousal influence time perception. Our findings show that empathy leads to a faster perceived passage of time. Despite increases in physiological arousal during empathy, arousal was not associated with changes in time perception. Instead, greater visual attention to the eyes predicted stronger temporal contraction. Furthermore, trait empathy and autism quotient were related to this effect, whereas alexithymia was not. These results provide the first empirical evidence that empathy alters time perception, elucidate the contribution of physiological and visual mechanisms to this phenomenon and extend current theories of time perception and empathy.",

      "title": "Tracking Satb2-positive retinal ganglion cells in zebrafish unveils developmental functional reorganization",
      "content": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) relay visual information to the brain, and their functional properties are crucial for visually guided behavior. However, functional maturation of RGCs across development remains elusive. Here, we investigated the developmental maturation of a genetically defined RGC subtype expressing Satb2 in zebrafish, which allowed single-layer-resolved analysis of the tectal neuropil. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized visual response properties of Satb2-positive RGC axon terminals at two developmental stages. At the early stage, responses segregated into seven functional clusters with diverse tuning profiles. By later stage, these responses reorganized into five clusters, indicating developmental restructuring of functional identities. Longitudinal imaging of individual RGC axons revealed that while some response types remain stable across development, others exhibit pronounced plasticity. In particular, certain RGC cluster acquired additional tuning features and converged into motion-sensitive cluster, coinciding with a marked expansion of motion-responsive cluster and reflecting progressive functional specialization. Visual deprivation experiments revealed that core visual tuning is genetically determined, whereas visual experience is crucial for fine-tuning of the particular functional subtype. Together, our findings provide a single-cell-resolved view of retinal circuit maturation and reveal how stable and flexible responses are integrated during the development of vertebrate vision.",

      "title": "Stimulus sensitivity in noisy neural systems",
      "content": "Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information requires a precise definition of neuronal sensitivity to stimuli. While tuning curves and firing rates offer intuitive insights, theoretical frameworks based on signal-to-noise ratio and decoding efficiency identify Fisher information as the canonical measure of sensitivity, due to its relation with decoding performance. However, this relation holds only under restrictive conditions--when many neurons encode the same stimulus feature or when neural noise is weak. In realistic settings, such as when complex or high-dimensional stimuli are represented by a small ensemble of neurons, Fisher information becomes ill-defined or misleading. To overcome these limitations, we investigate two complementary information-theoretic quantities--the stimulus-specific information (ISSI) and the local information (Iloc)--and propose them as robust alternatives for quantifying sensitivity. We show that ISSI and Iloc converge with Fisher information when signal to noise is large, yet remain meaningful and interpretable beyond that regime. Importantly, these measures capture distinct aspects of sensitivity: ISSI quantifies how observing a response reduces stimulus uncertainty, whereas Iloc reflects how small stimulus perturbations reshape the systems posterior beliefs. Together, they offer a unifying perspective linking information-theoretic and statistical notions of sensitivity, bridging theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of neural coding.",

      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
      "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "content": "The removal of brain waste is thought to be regulated by the circadian clock and sleep-wake cycle. A meningeal scavenger cell population, called mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs), uptake macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are poised to clear soluble brain waste. Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake. Consistently, muLECs are required for normal recovery after the heightened metabolic demand of a seizure, suggesting that muLEC clearance contributes to both normal and disrupted brain homeostasis.",

      "title": "Sex-specific effects of psychoactive drugs on memory performance in an animal model of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "content": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in working memory (WM) and executive control. Dysregulation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 signaling pathway has been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology due to its impact on neuronal connectivity and dopamine regulation. Using p35 knockout (p35KO) mice, a validated model exhibiting ADHD-like phenotypes, we investigated sex-specific WM performance, neuronal activation patterns, and responses to acute treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or fluoxetine (FLX), administered alone or in combination. Under basal conditions, p35KO mice of both sexes exhibited significant WM impairment in the Y-maze test compared with wild type (WT) counterparts, whereas recognition memory remained intact. Analysis of neuronal activation (c-Fos-IR) 90 minutes after testing revealed region- and sex-dependent alterations. p35KO males showed significantly reduced c-Fos-IR expression in prefrontal cortical regions, while both sexes exhibited increased c-Fos-IR in hippocampal regions. Acute MPH or FLX treatment significantly improved WM in p35KO males, but this benefit was lost with the combined treatment (MPH+FLX). In contrast, p35KO females showed no WM improvement with any treatment. Notably, WT females exhibited a pronounced decline in WM after exposure to MPH, FLX, or their combination, indicating sex-specific pharmacological sensitivity in healthy animals. These findings highlight the critical role of Cdk5/p35 signaling in maintaining the functional balance between prefrontal and hippocampal networks.

      "title": "Distinct mechanisms mediate dopamine-octopamine opponency in an insect model of olfaction",
      "content": "Neuromodulators play a key role in determining how an organism processes and responds to sensory cues. Often, different neuromodulators act on the same set of neural circuits to produce diverging behavioral outcomes. In this study, we examined how dopamine and octopamine alter odor-driven neural activity in a peripheral olfactory circuit (the antennal lobe) and thereby alter behavioral responses in an opposing manner. Our results indicate that dopamine suppressed GABAergic local neuron activity during odor stimulation. Releasing the antennal lobe network from inhibition increased the principal neural activity for all odorants and led to nonspecific increases in a behavioral appetitive response. Octopamine, on the other hand, did not alter the GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe but still reduced the odor-evoked principal neural activity and the behavioral responses elicited by all odorants. Thus, both dopamine and octopamine used distinct mechanisms (altering recurrent inhibition vs intrinsic excitability) to mediate opponent changes in odor-evoked neural activity and behavioral outcomes.",

      "title": "Comparative Study of BBB-Targeting AAV Capsids on Central Nervous System Delivery Efficiency",
      "content": "The efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is often limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study systematically evaluated the tissue distribution of three BBB-crossing AAV capsid variants (PHP.eB, CNSRCV300, and BI-hTFR1) following intravenous injection in mice, using either a constitutive promoter (CAG) or a neuron-specific promoter (hSyn) to drive EGFP reporter expression. Compared with AAV9, both PHP.eB and CNSRCV300 demonstrated significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain transduction efficiency. While the use of the hSyn promoter led to reduced transgene expression in the brain compared with the CAG promoter, and substantially decreased visible reporter expression in peripheral organs, viral deposition in the liver could still be detected via immunohistochemistry. Overall, CNSRCV300 exhibited the most favorable balance between brain-targeting efficiency and biosafety, highlighting its potential as a promising delivery vector. In summary, both the capsid and promoter jointly influence AAV-mediated expression in vivo, and although cell type-specific promoters can reduce off-target expression, residual viral deposition in non-target tissues remains a potential safety concern.",

      "title": "Decision revisions modulated by synaptic inhibition in the olfactory bulb facilitate learning",
      "content": "Behavioral responses are preceded by decisions based on perceived sensory evidence. In real life, sensory inputs are often noisy and change incessantly, raising the question of when and how accurate decisions are made. Cognitive flexibility allows us to revise the choices in case of perceptual conflicts, leading to response revisions. This involves switching between available choices or rapidly stopping misconstrued responses. Here, we quantified these erroneous behavioral actions and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. Mice were trained on an olfactory decision-making task wherein they had to distinguish between a rewarded and an unrewarded stimulus by responding with a lick or withholding it. While the animals respond by licking for both rewarded and unrewarded odor stimuli at the initial stages of learning, the responses almost disappear for the unrewarded ones in the learned stage. However, animals tend to initiate lick responses and stop within a few milliseconds for a few unrewarded trials, even when accuracy levels are high. We describe this phenomenon as decision revisions (DR), and observed it in 5-25% of trials among high-performance blocks. These revisions were mostly observed within a few hundred milliseconds of stimulation. We observed a significantly higher number of revision trials for binary odor mixture discriminations compared to monomolecular ones. Further, by enhancing inhibitory synaptic signaling in the olfactory bulb through photoactivation of ChR2-expressing GAD65-positive GABAergic interneurons, we observed faster odor discrimination and fewer revision trials. Thus, our findings confirm decision revisions that are stimulus complexity-dependent and the pre-cortical control over such a complex cognitive activity.",

      "content": "The integration of mobile robots into human environments requires that they behave in trustworthy ways. Trust develops through interaction, and erratic movements can easily break it. Previous research examined motion predictability and smoothness separately, but their combined effect remains unclear. We investigated how predictability (consistent versus random) and smoothness (gradual versus abrupt) influence human trust and emotion during collision avoidance in virtual reality. Twenty-six participants encountered a robot across repeated trials. We measured subjective valence, arousal, and trust, along with skin conductance responses. Predictability dominated the results. Consistent robot behavior led to increased trust and positive feelings over time. Conversely, unpredictable behavior kept trust low. Smoothness acted mainly as a moderator for arousal; smooth paths reduced the stress caused by unpredictable moves. We also found that prolonged proximity in gradual movements raised physiological arousal, even if users reported feeling calm. These findings suggest predictability drives social acceptance more than smoothness. In order to promote trust, robot designers should prioritize consistent, learnable behaviors.",

      "title": "Synergistic Effect of Valproate and Constraint Induced Movement Therapy on Functional Recovery Following Ischemic Stroke in Rats: Neuroplasticity and Corticosterone Associated Mechanisms",
      "content": "Most rehabilitation paradigms primarily rely on physical stimuli, but biological enhancers may play a complementary role in optimizing adaptive outcomes. The HDACi (Histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug valproate has shown neuroprotective properties following cerebral ischemia, but how it interacts with rehabilitative training is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the synergistic effect of Valproate (VPA) and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on functional recovery following stroke. We induced cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. VPA (300 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was administered within 3 hours after reperfusion and continued for 7 days, followed by CIMT for another week (6 hours/day). The study revealed a significant increase in total infarction volume in the stroke rats compared to controls on day 7 post-stroke. The behavioral assessments revealed that combined treatment with VPA and CIMT restored the neurological and motor behavior deficits. VPA treatment reduced plasma corticosterone levels and modulated heart rate variability indices in stroke rats, suggesting involvement of neuroendocrine stress responses in post stroke recovery. The electrophysiological findings reveal improved functional connectivity between the penumbral (left) motor cortex and the uninjured motor cortex following combinational treatment. The present study also examined the effects of chronic CIMT and VPA monotherapies and delayed onset CIMT (one week after stroke) on functional recovery following stroke; however, these approaches showed limited efficacy. Thus, the study concludes that VPA, along with rehabilitative training, may represent a novel strategy to improve stroke induced persistent functional deficits.",

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.
