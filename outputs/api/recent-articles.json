      "content": "Nociceptors are excitatory neurons that express a range of neuropeptides and have the essential role of detecting noxious mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli. Ablating these neurons profoundly reduces responses to pain. Here we investigated how nociceptive information is transmitted by developing genetic approaches to suppress glutamate transmission and neuropeptide signaling, individually and in combination. Remarkably, many pain responses persisted in mice where either nociceptor glutamate or neuropeptide signaling was blocked. By contrast, mice lacking both glutamate and neuropeptide transmission in nociceptors displayed profound pain insensitivity closely matching the effects of cell ablation. Together our results establish a role for neuropeptides as bone fide pain transmitters and demonstrate redundancy in nociceptor signaling, resolving long-standing questions about how pain is communicated to the brain.",

      "content": "Orthopedia (Otp) transcription factor is a critical determinant in the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, and its embryonic deletion results in lethality. Although Otp expression is maintained throughout life, its physiological function in adulthood is not well understood. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific, tamoxifen-inducible, conditional knockout mouse model to investigate the roles of Otp beyond development. Conditional deletion of Otp in two-month-old mice resulted in impaired stress responses, characterized by increased depressive-like behavior and elevated stress-induced cortisol levels. It also led to various metabolic changes, including reduced thyroid hormone levels and body temperature, a higher percentage of fat mass, and diminished responsiveness to ghrelin without affecting food intake, energy expenditure, or body weight. This composite metabolic phenotype was associated with reduced hypothalamic neuropeptides TRH, CRH, AgRP, and NPY expression. Our findings highlight the role of Otp in adult physiological functions as a key neuroendocrine integrator of adaptive stress response and energy balance.",

      "title": "Adaptive Eye Movement Behavior for Actions in Younger and Older Adults",
      "content": "Humans typically combine eye and head movements to visually track and interact with moving objects. If the object's trajectory can be predicted, humans can shift gaze to the anticipated object's future location. For instance, when hitting a moving ball, people predictively look at the ball's bouncing location, allowing them to overcome sensorimotor delays that would otherwise limit visual information uptake from that position. Such delays become pronounced with healthy aging, which might drive a behavioral shift towards stronger reliance on predictive gaze allocation to future positions of interest during visuomotor tasks. To investigate this, we examined gaze and hand movements of older and younger adults who played an iPad-based version of the game 'Pong' against an automated opponent. Participants moved a paddle of two different sizes with their finger to intercept a ball moving in two speeds and bouncing off the side walls. We hypothesized that aging would lead to earlier gaze shifts to positions of interest, such as to the final wall bounce location before the ball moved toward the participants' paddle, and to their own paddle around the moment of interception. As expected, both age groups intercepted fewer balls when using smaller paddles. Contrary to our hypothesis, older participants looked later than younger adults to the final wall bounce. However, they shifted their gaze earlier to their own paddle before interception, especially at the beginning of the experiment. This suggests that aging enhances predictive gaze shifts related to the immediate action. While gaze allocation patterns largely overlap between older and younger adults, aging specifically leads to adaptive eye movements just before interacting with the environment.",

      "title": "Legal but immoral: attitudes toward non-invasive brain stimulation for cognitive enhancement",
      "content": "Cognitive enhancement involves using substances or technologies to improve mental performance in healthy individuals. While methods such as caffeine are widely accepted, others, including prescription stimulants and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS), evoke ethical concern. This study examined how university students evaluate three forms of cognitive enhancement (natural, pharmacological, brain stimulation) across five moral domains: academic fairness, free will, naturalness, self-identity, and safety. We also tested how evaluations were shaped by framing (preservation vs. enhancement) and priming (self-affecting vs. non-self-affecting). A total of 449 students completed an online experiment with a 2 by 2 by 3 mixed design, rating enhancement acceptability after reading intervention-specific scenarios. Natural enhancers were judged most positively, followed by brain stimulation and then pharmacological agents. Importantly, although brain stimulation is legal and marketed as non-invasive, it was evaluated more like pharmacological enhancement than natural methods, indicating that legality does not equate to moral acceptability. Framing effects showed that participants were more accepting of enhancement when it was described as preserving ability rather than augmenting it beyond baseline. Priming participants to consider how others use might affect their own outcomes reduced moral acceptability, particularly for pharmacological and brain stimulation methods in the domain of academic fairness. Overall, public attitudes toward enhancement appeared shaped less by legality or objective safety than by intuitive moral reasoning. These findings highlight the importance of adopting pluralistic, context-sensitive approaches to policy and regulation, as student judgments reflect concerns about fairness, authenticity, and competition in academic life.",

      "title": "A neuronal imaging dataset for deep learning in the reconstruction of single-neuron axons",
      "content": "Neuron reconstruction is a critical step in quantifying neuronal structures from imaging data. Advances in molecular labeling techniques and optical imaging technologies have spurred extensive research into the patterns of long-range neuronal projections. However, mapping these projections incurs significant costs, as large-scale reconstruction of individual axonal arbors remains time-consuming. In this study, we present a dataset comprising axon imaging volumes along with corresponding annotations to facilitate the evaluation and development of axon reconstruction algorithms. This dataset, derived from 11 mouse brain samples imaged using fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography, contains carefully selected 852 volume images sized at 192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192 voxels. These images exhibit substantial variations in terms of axon density, image intensity, and signal-to-noise ratios, even within localized regions. Conventional methods often struggle when processing such complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a distance field-supervised segmentation network designed to enhance image signals effectively. Our results demonstrate significantly improved axon detection rates across both state-of-the-art and traditional methodologies. The released dataset and benchmark algorithm provide a data foundation for advancing novel axon reconstruction methods and are valuable for accelerating the reconstruction of long-range axonal projections.",

      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",
