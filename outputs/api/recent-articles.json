      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "Non-overlapping social and food reward representations in the basolateral amygdala",
      "content": "The ability to consider and appraise positively valenced stimuli in the environment, such as food and social interaction, to guide appropriate action is important for survival of most animals. Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given that the BLA and mPFC play differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.",

      "title": "Typical development of the human fetal subplate: regional heterogeneity, growth, and asymmetry assessed by in vivo T2-weighted MRI",
      "content": "The subplate (SP) is a transient fetal brain compartment supporting neuronal migration, axonal ingrowth, and early cortical activity, yet the dynamics of its regional development remain poorly understood in vivo. Using T2-weighted fetal MRI of 68 typically developing fetuses (22-32 weeks gestational age, GA), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to quantify regional SP morphology (thickness, surface area, and volume). SP characteristics scaled strongly with GA and residual brain volume and showed marked regional differences. After correcting for geometric confounds, regional variation of SP thickness persisted, with highest values in parietal and perisylvian regions, suggesting that SP thickness may serve as a sensitive marker of intrinsic developmental differences. Between late 2nd and early 3rd trimester, mean SP thickness increased by 39.2% with large variation across regions (11.0 SD), whereas surface area growth was more uniform (64.3%, 0.7 SD). Continuous growth trajectories clustered into distinct spatiotemporal profiles: early-developing regions (e.g., pericentral and medial occipital cortices) contrasted with later-developing regions (prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices). These patterns partially recapitulate primary-to-association, medial-to-lateral, and posterior-to-anterior maturational hierarchies, pointing to organized developmental program. SP development also showed region-specific hemispheric asymmetries, including leftward thickness and volume asymmetry in superior temporal and precentral gyri. Some asymmetries amplified, others attenuated or reversed with age, suggesting both transient states and potential precursors of postnatal lateralization. Together, these findings provide a framework for regional SP quantification and position SP morphology, particularly thickness, as a promising early biomarker that might link fetal SP changes to subsequent cortical development and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

      "content": "Circuit based studies of aggression often focus on the output of a small group of regions referred to as the core aggression circuit, yet a whole brain map of activity has yet to be produced. Using resident intruder assays in male and female Swiss Webster mice, we combined iDISCO+ cFos imaging with a weighted co-expression network analyses to identify mesoscale co-activation modules in aggressive (AGG) vs. non-aggressive (NON) animals. We performed a module preservation analysis between each phenotype within each sex followed by differential correlation to localize edge-level changes. Behaviorally, AGG mice spent more time attacking, while females showed greater social investigation. Network analyses revealed that NON networks often preserved density of AGG modules, but connectivity reorganized with aggression. In male AGGs there was large spread reorganization of numerous modules: a large sensorimotor subcortical blue module, a pallidal/hypothalamic/brainstem yellow module, and a brainstem-heavy green module. Surprisingly the brown module, enriched for classic social-behavior regions was moderately preserved in male NONs. In females, the turquoise module spanning somatosensory/interoceptive cortex and midbrain regions and the brown sensory cortex/amygdala module were the least preserved. These results indicate that aggression recruits distributed mesoscale communities via edge-specific gain, with males displaying broad strengthening along a cortex/basal ganglia/ hypothalamus/brainstem axis and females showing more targeted potentiation within sensory/arousal modules. This framework nominates candidate hubs and edges for causal manipulation.",

      "title": "Astrocytes and neurons encode natural stimuli with partially shared but distinct composite receptive fields",
      "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active participants in sensory processing, but whether they show selective responses to stimulus features, analogous to neuronal receptive fields, is not yet established. To address this, we used two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of anesthetized mice during presentation of natural ultrasonic vocalizations. Our aim was to compare astrocytic responses with those of neighboring neurons and to determine whether astrocytes exhibit feature-selective receptive fields. Event detection showed that astrocytic calcium activity is highly heterogeneous, but only a minority of events were consistently stimulus-linked. To examine this stimulus-driven subset, we estimated receptive field features using maximum noise entropy modeling and compared them with those of concurrently recorded neurons. Despite qualitative similarities in receptive-field features, analysis of modulation spectra and principal angles showed that astrocytic and neuronal receptive fields overlap but occupy distinct regions of feature space. This indicates that astrocytes and neurons encode partially shared, but not identical, dimensions of the sensory stimulus. Our findings indicate that astrocytes encode diverse sensory features, providing an additional contribution to neuronal encoding. This suggests that astrocytic calcium activity is not simply a reflection of neuronal firing, but instead represents a distinct component of cortical sensory processing.",

      "title": "Investigating the effect of channel pruning on functional near-infrared spectroscopy data collected from children aged 5-24 months",
      "content": "Significance Infant functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data are particularly vulnerable to noise; participant behaviour can result in motion artefacts and reduced set-up times can cause poor optode coupling. Accurate channel pruning is therefore essential but approaches vary and often use adult-derived thresholds, risking unnecessary data loss. Aim This work systematically compared pruning approaches and parameter choices to evaluate their effects on data quality and retention in infant fNIRS. Approach Data from 5-24 month-old infants were collected across two cohorts, using two paradigms. Channel pruning was performed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Quality Testing of Near Infrared Scans (QT-NIRS) tool, varying key thresholds. Multilevel models assessed effects of pruning method, parameter choice, age, motion, and testing site on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channels retained. Results QT-NIRS produced significantly higher SNR than CV pruning across nearly all age, task, and cohort combinations, when matched for data retention. Higher QT-NIRS thresholds improved quality but reduced retention. Motion prevalence strongly reduced both SNR and retention; testing site and age had smaller but notable effects. Conclusions QT-NIRS offers a better balance of data quality and retention than CV pruning. Lower QT-NIRS thresholds than adult defaults are recommended for infant data. These findings provide practical guidance for preprocessing pipelines in developmental fNIRS research.",

      "title": "Evidence for age-related vulnerability in dopamine-glutamate projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex",
      "content": "The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is selectively vulnerable to age-related decline and is essential for novelty detection and episodic memory. While dopaminergic (DAergic) input is known to modulate LEC function, how aging impacts this circuitry remains unclear. Here, we used two viral labeling strategies to investigate projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LEC. First, we employed an INTRSECT dual-recombinase approach in TH-Flp::VGLUT2-Cre mice to selectively label dopamine-only (DA-only) and dopamine-glutamate co-releasing (DA-GLU) neurons. Next, we used a DAT-Cre-driven ChR2-YFP strategy to broadly label all DA axons. We found that both DA-only and DA-GLU populations innervate the LEC. With age, we observed a selective reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signal within DA axons in the LEC, despite preserved axonal structure as revealed by YFP labeling. VGLUT2 signal within DA-GLU terminals appeared less affected. In the VTA, TH+ neuron density declined with age, with distinct spatial patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. These findings reveal an age-related vulnerability of DAergic projections to the LEC and suggest a circuit-level mechanism may contribute to memory impairments in aging.",

      "title": "CORTICAL AUDITORY PROCESSING FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD: ASSOCIATIONS WITH SPEECH UNDERSTANDING",
      "content": "The maturation of the auditory system is critical for the development of speech perception from childhood through early adulthood. However, the developmental trajectories and behavioral significance of cortical responses to speech sounds, particularly in relation to frequency specificity, remain poorly understood. Here, we presented low-frequency (/m/) and high-frequency (/s/) speech sounds to 60 typically developing individuals aged 5-24 years and recorded early cortical responses (P1 and N1) using electroencephalography. We also examined associations between these neural responses and speech understanding in quiet and in the presence of speech interferers. The developmental trajectories of P1 and N1 revealed distinct age- and stimulus-dependent patterns, including both linear and non-linear changes across development. These findings delineate frequency-specific maturational profiles within the cortical auditory system and identify potential neurophysiological markers of speech perception, providing a normative benchmark for assessing atypical auditory development.",

      "title": "Selective innervation of subpopulations of striatal neurons by distinct sets of neurons of the external globus pallidus",
      "content": "The striatum, the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, contains diverse populations of projection neurons and interneurons, each with distinct roles in motor processing. The external globus pallidus contains distinct populations of inhibitory neurons that are highly interconnected with other regions of the basal ganglia. How pallidal neurons innervate different populations of striatal neurons is critical for our understanding of their role in motor processing. Here we use monosynaptic viral tracing in transgenic mice to quantitively define the organization of pallidostriatal connectivity. We show that FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons provide the greatest input to the striatum, primarily targeting indirect pathway spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, prototypic pallidal neurons, defined by Nkx2-1 expression, preferentially innervate parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. These data reveal a structured and selective organization of pallidostriatal projections, suggesting that distinct classes of pallidal neurons modulate striatal circuits through complementary pathways. Mapping these connections is key to understanding how basal ganglia networks coordinate motor control.",

      "title": "Measured and modelled transitions between self-paced walking and synchronization with rhythmic auditory cues",
      "content": "Constraining gait rhythm with a metronome has been shown to influence gait pattern in many different ways. While rhythmic cues can improve several parameters in some clinical populations, they do alter the long-range autocorrelations naturally exhibited in series of stride durations. However, transitions between walking with and without a metronome (and vice versa) have not been measured; it is therefore unclear how people adapt to such a change in task. To address this gap, a total of 21 healthy volunteers were asked to walk overground under three conditions: one unconstrained control condition, followed by two conditions in which a metronome was activated during either the first or second half of the trial to test both transitions. The long-range autocorrelations were assessed over a sliding window on the stride series to measure their evolution. Our observations were reproduced with a computational model allowing us to relate sudden changes in movement parameters to the long-range autocorrelations, which are typically measured over longer timescales. The results showed a clear transition in both conditions involving a metronome, with long-range autocorrelations of the series of stride durations gradually reduced when the metronome was turned on and recovered when it was turned off. In these two conditions, the change in long-range autocorrelations could be reproduced in the model by an instantaneous switching of the control policy associated with the presence or not of the metronome, suggesting that long-range autocorrelations emerge from a flexible control strategy that rapidly regulates timing and amplitude parameters according to task requirements.",
