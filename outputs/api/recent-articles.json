      "title": "Macroscopic quantum effects in the brain: new insights into the fundamental principle underlying conscious processes",
      "content": "Empirical findings indicate that conscious states are inextricably linked to long-range synchronized activity patterns that result from phase transitions and exhibit the key features of self-organized criticality. This article builds a bridge between these neurophysiological characteristics of consciousness and the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which provides the appropriate methodological resources for explaining the origin of phase transitions and critical dynamics. An essential ingredient of QED is a fluctuating ocean of energy, the ubiquitous electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF), consisting of a spectrum of normal modes. It can be deduced from QED-based model calculations that the resonant interaction of the ZPF with the glutamate pool of cortical microcolumns is an important prerequisite for the initiation of phase transitions, giving rise to macroscopic quantum effects that play a crucial role in modulating the activity of ion channels and regulating the neuronal firing rate. The firing rate of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons determines the excitatory-inhibitory balance, which has been identified as the essential control parameter for establishing and maintaining the critical regime. Thus, taking all available pieces of evidence into account, profound new insights take shape, namely, that self-organized criticality arises from a bottom-up orchestration process involving the ZPF and that the fundamental principle behind the formation of conscious states is the resonant coupling of the brain to the ZPF. This coupling causes an amplification of the dynamically relevant ZPF modes, suggesting that the ZPF holds the key to the understanding of consciousness and that the necessary condition for the formation of a conscious state is the selective excitation of ZPF modes. These insights pave the way for novel experimental paradigms designed to systematically manipulate conditions in the brain, thereby collecting new data that can be used to empirically substantiate the significance of resonant brain-ZPF interaction for the formation of conscious states.",

      "title": "Effects of rTMS on swallowing function and neuroimaging features in post-stroke dysphagia",
      "content": "IntroductionDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is common after stroke and can lead to complications like malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and increased mortality. Recovery is driven by neural reorganization, yet traditional interventions focus on managing swallowing difficulties rather than restoring brain function. Neuromodulatory approaches like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show potential for promoting brain plasticity and recovery. While rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing after stroke, few studies have explored its neural mechanisms at the brain level, as opposed to focusing on motor-evoked potentials recorded from peripheral muscles.MethodsThis study examined the effects of 5\u202fHz rTMS on post-stroke dysphagia by targeting the contralesional mylohyoid cortical area. Resting-state fMRI was employed to investigate the neural correlates of rTMS effects. Local brain activity was measured using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and percentage amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), while network connectivity was assessed with graph theory analysis.ResultsrTMS reduced spontaneous activity in the contralesional middle frontal gyrus and putamen, and in the ipsilesional insula and middle frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), regions that were hyperactive at baseline in dysphagic patients. Altered network topology in the left medial superior frontal gyrus suggested connectivity reorganization.ConclusionThese preliminary findings support rTMS as a promising adjunct therapy for post-stroke dysphagia by inducing cortical plasticity, as demonstrated by changes in both regional activity and network topology. Further validation in studies with larger samples is needed.",

      "title": "GEMReg: a spatio-temporal grayordinate ensemble modelling framework for predicting task activation maps from resting-state fMRI",
      "content": "ObjectiveRecent advances in neuroimaging have highlighted the growing utility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) as an alternative to task-based fMRI. In addition to being simpler, cost-effective, and time-efficient, rs-fMRI is particularly advantageous for non-compliant populations such as infants, elderly individuals, and patients with physical or cognitive impairments.MethodsMotivated by this, the present study introduces a novel Grayordinate Ensemble Modeling for Regression (GEMReg) framework for predicting task activation maps solely from rs-fMRI data, which, for the first time, leverages the rich temporal information of rs-fMRI for the task activation maps prediction. Specifically, the proposed approach uniquely formulates the task-activation map prediction as time series regression and exploits different temporal features and representations of the rs-fMRI for the same, including the proposed novel histogram-based features. Focusing on the individual characteristics of the grayordinates, 59412 individualized models (one per grayordinate) were trained by employing multiple univariate time series regressors. To optimize the prediction performance, a novel GEMReg framework is developed that selects the optimal feature-regressor combination for each grayordinate, exploiting the subtle variances in the individual grayordinate mapping. Furthermore, the temporal feature-based GEMReg is integrated with conventional functional connectivity maps-based spatial features, resulting in the spatio-temporal GEMReg, uniquely benefiting from both temporal and spatial features.Results and conclusionComparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed spatio-temporal GEMReg consistently outperforms existing methods across standard evaluation metrics, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art for task activation map prediction using rs-fMRI.",

      "title": "Relationship between impaired cerebral lymphatic function and iron deposition, blood flow in VaD: a clinical MRI study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms induced by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in the vascular dementia (VaD) is extremely complex. Recent studies have identified altered lymphatic function as a key factor contributing to the development of cognitive deficits, whether they linked to iron deposition and reduced cerebral blood flow remains unclear.MethodsThe study involved 59 participants, comprising 30 healthy controls and 29 patients with VaD. Each participant underwent QSM, ASL, and DTI imaging scans and clinical measurements. The ALPS index based on DTI, QSM, and ASL for the left and right hemispheres, as well as for the whole brain were calculated and compared between groups. Regional mean susceptibility and mean CBF based on AAL template were calculated and compared between groups. Correlation analyses were performed between altered indexes and clinical measurements. Finally, mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether the mean susceptibility rate and mean CBF were involved in the modulation process of the ALPS.ResultsDTI-ALPS based analysis demonstrated a significantly lower ALPS index for the left, right, and whole brain in the VaD as compared to healthy controls. Mean susceptibility in the bilateral superior occipital gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus was significantly higher, whereas mean CBF in the eft inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, right rolandic operculum, right insula, and right heschl gyrus was significantly lower in the VaD. Further correlation analyses revealed associations between elevated mean susceptibility, reduced ALPS index, and cognitive impairments. Additionally, the results of correlation and mediation analyses suggested that CBF may be involved in the regulatory process of DTI-ALPS.ConclusionOur results demonstrated that altered lymphatic function is a key pathological factor in VaD, and reduced cerebral blood flow may play a role in this process. These findings provide a theoretical basis for identifying new targets in the treatment of VaD.",

      "title": "Quantitative assessment of signal quality and usability of EEG and EMG recordings with PEDOT:PSS-coated microneedle electrodes",
      "content": "IntroductionBioelectrical signals are vital indicators of physiological function, psychological status, and clinical conditions. However, traditional wet electrodes using conductive gel are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and degrade over time due to gel drying. Recently, microneedle (MN) electrodes coated with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have been developed for high-quality signal acquisition. Although low electrode\u2013skin impedance has been demonstrated on hairless regions, their use in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings on hairy scalp areas and quantitative comparisons with conventional electrodes in both EEG and electromyography (EMG) remain limited.MethodsWe fabricated two MN electrode types of different lengths\u2014one for EMG on hairless skin and one for EEG on the hairy scalp\u2014and compared them with conventional wet and dry electrodes. EMG was recorded during a force-matching task; EEG was assessed via somatosensory evoked potentials. We also evaluated setup/cleanup time, comfort, and pain during EEG measurement.ResultsFor EMG, MN electrodes achieved significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios than conventional electrodes. For EEG, they outperformed dry electrodes and matched wet electrodes in signal quality\u2014without using conductive gel. Although additional time was required to part hair, cleanup was faster due to the absence of gel. Pain was comparable to dry electrodes.DiscussionPEDOT:PSS-coated MN electrodes provided superior EMG signal quality and high-quality EEG signals comparable to wet electrodes even without gel. These findings suggest that PEDOT:PSS-coated MN electrodes offer a compelling balance of signal quality and user convenience, making them especially advantageous for real-world and clinical applications where time efficiency, minimal discomfort, and gel-free operation are critical.",

      "title": "Morphological evidence suggestive of a hierarchical mode of glial cell diversification and intrinsic developmental plasticity within the murine enteric nervous system",
      "content": "Enteric glial cells represent a highly heterogeneous cell population residing both within and outside the ganglia and inter-ganglionic fiber bundles that form the core networks of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Despite the availability of several relevant single-cell transcriptomic datasets, the classification of enteric glia in various subtypes is still mainly based on their particular location and associated morphological attributes. We recently reported that these \u201ctopo-morphological\u201d enteric glia subtypes gradually appear during early postnatal development in healthy wildtype mice, under the influence of structural tissue changes that occur during this period. This process is also influenced by the source of ENS progenitors, with notable biased contributions by Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). This prior work further suggested the existence of a hierarchical program of spatiotemporal differentiation, whereby intra-network enteric glia (i.e., within ganglia and fiber bundles) of the myenteric plexus sequentially give rise to nearby extra-network enteric glia as well as to more distant intra- and extra-network enteric glia of the submucosal plexus. To learn more about enteric glia diversification, we reasoned that the Nr2f1Spt/Spt mouse model of Waardenburg syndrome type IV could be particularly informative, as the absence of ENS in the colon of these mice is specifically due to premature glial differentiation of ENS progenitors before birth. Our new analyses of the ENS-containing ileum from these mice now also reveal abnormal acquisition of enteric glia diversity after birth. These alterations of enteric glia diversification are in agreement with the previously proposed hierarchical differentiation model in wildtype mice. This work also uncovered an intriguing neuronal phenotype in Nr2f1Spt/Spt mice in which a reduction in the number of neurons is associated with an increase in their size. Many of these larger neurons also co-express the glia marker S100\u03b2, which together with the noted increased contribution of SCPs to the overall pool of enteric glia further highlight the remarkable plasticity of the developing ENS.",

      "title": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of neurofeedback training efficacy and neural mechanisms in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder",
      "content": "IntroductionNeurofeedback in the treatment of psychological disorders has gained increasingly widespread interest in recent years. As the use of neurofeedback training expands, it is important to elucidate its treatment efficacy, especially for prevalent and debilitating psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Likewise, furthering our understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms by which neurofeedback acts is also necessary.MethodsHere, we present the results of a PROSPERO registered (protocol number: CRD42020184659) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of neurofeedback training for treatment of PTSD in adults. We evaluate the efficacy of different neurofeedback modalities used to treat PTSD, including functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) and electroencephalogram neurofeedback (EEG-NF). We also differentiate active control (sham or yoked sham) studies from passive control (waitlist, treatment as usual, no treatment, and any non-neurofeedback based intervention) studies.ResultsOur results show that EEG-NF has a moderate to large effect in reducing PTSD symptoms pre- to post-treatment compared to passive controls (k = 5). Two fMRI-NF RCTs, both using sham controls, showed no improvement in PTSD symptoms, pre- to post-treatment. However, our confidence in these findings is very low to low due to concerns regarding risk of bias, imprecision, and conflicts of interest. Neurofeedback in passive control studies outperformed neurofeedback in active control studies relative to their respective control treatment arms. We also synthesized the neural results from these studies and found that between-group neural effects were generally inconclusive.DiscussionThese findings highlight the need for improved controls in studies examining neurofeedback for PTSD to reliably determine whether neurofeedback training, or other factors, are the basis for improvements in PTSD symptoms. We elaborate on some of the underlying neural mechanisms by which neurofeedback training shows potential in improving PTSD symptoms to guide future developments and provide recommendations for future neurofeedback interventions in treating PTSD.",

      "title": "Humans incorrectly reject confident accusatory AI judgments",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.02848v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated verbal deception detection using methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been shown to outperform humans in disentangling lies from truths. Research suggests that transparency and interpretability of computational methods tend to increase human acceptance of using AI to support decisions. However, the extent to which humans accept AI judgments for deception detection remains unclear. We experimentally examined how an AI model's accuracy (i.e., its overall performance in deception detection) and confidence (i.e., the model's uncertainty in single-statements predictions) influence human adoption of the model's judgments. Participants (n=373) were presented with veracity judgments of an AI model with high or low overall accuracy and various degrees of prediction confidence. The results showed that humans followed predictions from a highly accurate model more than from a less accurate one. Interestingly, the more confident the model, the more people deviated from it, especially if the model predicted deception. We also found that human interaction with algorithmic predictions either worsened the machine's performance or was ineffective. While this human aversion to accept highly confident algorithmic predictions was partly explained by participants' tendency to overestimate humans' deception detection abilities, we also discuss how truth-default theory and the social costs of accusing someone of lying help explain the findings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.02785v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid rise of AI-generated art has sparked debate about potential biases in how audiences perceive and evaluate such works. This study investigates how composer information and listener characteristics shape the perception of AI-generated music, adopting a mixed-method approach. Using a diverse set of stimuli across various genres from two AI music models, we examine effects of perceived authorship on liking and emotional responses, and explore how attitudes toward AI, personality traits, and music-related variables influence evaluations. We further assess the influence of perceived humanness and analyze open-ended responses to uncover listener criteria for judging AI-generated music. Attitudes toward AI proved to be the best predictor of both liking and emotional intensity of AI-generated music. This quantitative finding was complemented by qualitative themes from our thematic analysis, which identified ethical, cultural, and contextual considerations as important criteria in listeners' evaluations of AI-generated music. Our results offer a nuanced view of how people experience music created by AI tools and point to key factors and methodological considerations for future research on music perception in human-AI interaction.",

      "title": "Real-Time Multimodal Data Collection Using Smartwatches and Its Visualization in Education",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.02651v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Wearable sensors, such as smartwatches, have become increasingly prevalent across domains like healthcare, sports, and education, enabling continuous monitoring of physiological and behavioral data. In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.",
