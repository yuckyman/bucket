      "title": "Rehabilitation drives functional reorganization of intact corticospinal-supraspinal projections following partial spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity and impairs skilled voluntary movement, yet most human SCIs are anatomically incomplete, allowing spared CST pathways to engage in rehabilitation-mediated plasticity to promote functional recovery. How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery. These findings identify a set of spinally-projecting medullary nuclei as key substrates for rehabilitation-induced CST plasticity and highlight the MdV as a potential mediator of restored motor function. This work defines how voluntary rehabilitation reorganizes spared corticospinal pathways and provides targets for optimizing activity-based interventions after SCI.",

      "title": "Mechanical Ventilation Suppresses Glymphatic Function in Parallel with Delirium-Like Symptoms in Mice",
      "content": "Delirium is a frequent and serious complication in intensive care patients, arising from overlapping vulnerabilities that obscure its primary causes. Using healthy mice, we tested whether mechanical ventilation combined with inhalation anesthetics and opioid sedation is sufficient to induce delirium-like behavior through disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glymphatic dynamics. We found that ventilation acutely increased intracranial pressure and induced a long-lasting suppression of glymphatic transport, thereby re-routing and impairing brain waste clearance and promoting cytokine accumulation. These observations establish a mechanistic link between ventilator-associated alterations in brain fluid dynamics and delirium. Our findings identify glymphatic dysfunction and disturbed CSF flow as contributors to acute brain dysfunction following mechanical ventilation and suggest that therapies enhancing glymphatic flux or stabilizing intracranial pressure could reduce delirium incidence and severity in critically ill patients.",

      "title": "Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure differentially alters acute ethanol sensitivity of GABAergic transmission in CRFR1- and CRFR1+ CeM neurons",
      "content": "Prenatal exposure to alcohol (PAE) increases the risk for misusing alcohol and/or developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) by adulthood. The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system is a major target of pre- and post-natal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. CRF and its receptor (CRFR1), in part, mediate EtOH potentiated GABA release in the medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) of adult male rodents. Interestingly, our lab has shown a disruption in the function and expression of CeM CRFR1 and acute EtOH's effects on GABA transmission in PAE adolescent animals, but it is unknown whether these alterations to the CRF system persist into adulthood or alter the actions of acute EtOH on GABAergic transmission in the CeM. Using CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats, this study examined how moderate PAE alters acute EtOH modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- CeM neurons in adult offspring (P80-105). Pregnant dams were exposed to vaporized ethanol or room air (control) on gestational day 12 (G12) for 6 hours and whole-cell electrophysiology was performed in the CeM to assess the actions of acute EtOH (44, 66, & 88 mM) on GABAergic transmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- neurons. We found unique effects of PAE that were cell type- and concentration-dependent in males and females, suggesting PAE dysregulates acute EtOH's modulation of GABA transmission within the CeM in a sex-specific manner. This study contributes to the expanding body of research exploring the effects of PAE and how a single exposure can impact neurophysiological mechanisms in brain regions associated with AUD.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Andrew, Founder of Zencoder.<p>While building our IDE extensions and cloud agents, we ran into the same issue many of you likely face when using coding agents in complex repos: agents getting stuck in loops, apologizing, and wasting time.<p>We tried to manage this with scripts, but juggling terminal windows and copy-paste prompting was painful. So we built Zenflow, a free desktop tool to orchestrate AI coding workflows.<p>It handles the things we were missing in standard chat interfaces:<p>Cross-Model Verification: You can have Codex review Claude\u2019s code, or run them in parallel to see which model handles the specific context better.<p>Parallel Execution: Run five different approaches on a backlog item simultaneously\u2014mix \"Human-in-the-Loop\" for hard problems with \"YOLO\" runs for simple tasks.<p>Dynamic Workflows: Configured via simple .md files. Agents can actually \"rewire\" the next steps of the workflow dynamically based on the problem at hand.<p>Project list/kanban views across all workload<p>What we learned building this<p>To tune Zenflow, we ran 100+ experiments across public benchmarks (SWE-Bench-*, T-Bench) and private datasets. Two major takeaways that might interest this community:<p>Benchmark Saturation: Models are becoming progressively overtrained on all versions of SWE-Bench (even Pro). We found public results are diverging significantly from performance on private datasets. If you are building workflows, you can't rely on public benches.<p>The \"Goldilocks\" Workflow: In autonomous mode, heavy multi-step processes often multiply errors rather than fix them. Massive, complex prompt templates look good on paper but fail in practice. The most reliable setups landed in a narrow \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone of just enough structure without over-orchestration.<p>The app is free to use and supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Zencoder.<p>We\u2019ve been dogfooding this heavily, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the default workflows and if they fit your mental model for agentic coding.<p>Download: <a href=\"https://zencoder.ai/zenflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zencoder.ai/zenflow</a>\nYT flyby: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "To some extent, humans can re-experience the sensations of past events and pre-experience the future. These capacities are inter-related. But there are substantial individual differences. At the extremes, small minorities of people report that they either cannot have imagined experiences at all, or that their imagined sensations are as real to them as their actual experiences of the physical world. We wanted to know if such individual differences are uniform across different types of imagined experience (e.g. vision, audio, taste and smell), or if people generally have idiosyncratic patterns of different types (vision, audio, taste and smell) of imagined experiences. We find that people report having idiosyncratic diets of different types of imagined sensation, characterised by differences in salience. One person might have more salient imagined visual than taste experiences, while another reports the reverse. Moreover, these propensities are consistent across peoples attempts to re-experience the past, and to pre-experience the future, and they predict peoples experience and usage of different types of imagined sensation in their everyday lives.",

      "title": "An Interactive Brain Atlas of Knowledge",
      "content": "Biomedical knowledge about the brain increases every day, with a rapidly growing number of scientific publications, datasets, and software tools. While this informational plethora is not merely comprehensible by human beings, recent developments in information science and computational linguistics aim to make this knowledge programmatically accessible by literature mining. However, integrating these semantic methods into neuroimaging standards remains insufficient, hindering researchers from unraveling their full potential. Therefore, we developed the semantic meta-analysis platform The Virtual Brain adapter of semantics (TVBase) that projects biomedical knowledge preserved in over 36 million scientific articles onto a 3D standardized brain. The literature-mining platform SCAIView was used to extract ontologically defined biomedical entities and their associations with brain anatomy from the PubMed database. By querying a specific concept, the association strength with each anatomical term was calculated using entropy. To project the data onto a standardized brain, we created a unique transformation matrix that links over 800 anatomical terms to voxel coordinates of a parcellated standard brain. This novel method of knowledge projection extracts region-specific information about biomedical concepts from the literature to support translational multi-scale approaches to computational neuroscience. The multi-purpose software framework TVBase is openly available as a Python library. It aims for hypothesis-free neuroimaging pattern interpretation, hypothesis generation, and applications in personalized medicine.",

      "content": "Sensory processing in the mammalian cortex relies on extensive feedforward and feedback connections, yet how information is routed along these pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the functional properties of feedback and feedforward neurons in the mouse olfactory (piriform) cortex. We selectively labeled neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB, feedback) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, feedforward) and recorded their activity during passive odor exposure and learning of an odor discrimination task. We found that odor identity and reward associations were encoded by OB-projecting ensembles early during odor exposure, whereas mPFC-projecting neurons encoded this information later, aligned with behavioral responses. Moreover, mPFC-projecting neurons maintained a stable representation of valence across days, while OB-projecting neurons exhibited pronounced plasticity. Together, these findings reveal that odor information is selectively routed through feedforward and feedback pathways and suggest that the functional properties of piriform neurons mirror the computational demands of their downstream targets.",

      "title": "DfE-DB: A systematic database of 3.8 million human decisions across multiple experience-based tasks",
      "content": "Learning from experience is central to human decision making, yet research on experience-based choice remains fragmented across paradigms and disciplines. We present the Decision-from-Experience Database (DfE-DB), a standardized, openly accessible resource comprising 3.8 million trial-level decisions from 11,921 participants across 168 studies and 13 paradigms. By harmonizing raw behavioral data and classifying studies along 13 key design features, the database enables quantitative comparisons previously obscured by heterogeneous task and data structures. Using this resource, we show that choice tendencies--toward higher risk, expected value, or experienced mean--vary substantially across paradigms and are strongly shaped by core design features such as feedback type, outcome structure, stationarity, and sampling. These features explain substantial cross-study variability and reveal underexplored paradigm variants. DfE-DB provides the empirical infrastructure necessary to test the generality of behavioral phenomena and computational models, fostering a more integrated science of decisions from experience.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Pyrefly's Pydantic integration aims to provide a seamless, out-of-the-box experience, allowing you to statically validate your Pydantic code as you type, rather than solely at runtime. No plugins or manual configuration required!</p> <p>Supporting third-party packages like Pydantic in a language server or type checker is a non-trivial challenge. Unlike the Python standard library, third-party packages may introduce their own conventions, dynamic behaviors, and runtime logic that can be difficult to analyze statically. Many type checkers either require plugins (like Mypy\u2019s Pydantic plugin) or offer only limited support for these types of projects. At the time of writing, Mypy is currently the only other major typechecker that provides robust support for Pydantic.</p> <p>Full blog post: <a href=\"https://pyrefly.org/blog/pyrefly-pydantic/\">https://pyrefly.org/blog/pyrefly-pydantic/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeamMeUpBiscotti\"> /u/BeamMeUpBiscotti </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po3kbe/fly_through_data_validation_with_pyreflys_new/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po3kbe/fly_through_data_validation_with_pyreflys_new/\">[comments]</a></span>",
