      "title": "fMRI-Based Prediction of Eye Gaze During Naturalistic Movie Viewing Reveals Eye-Movement-Related Brain Activity",
      "content": "Eye gaze and eye movements provide important indices of perceptual and cognitive processes, particularly under naturalistic conditions such as movie viewing. However, concurrent eye tracking is often unavailable in functional MRI (fMRI) studies due to technical and logistical constraints. Recent deep learning approaches have made it possible to estimate eye gaze directly from eyeball signals in fMRI data, offering a potential alternative to camera-based eye tracking. Here, we applied a pre-trained fMRI-based deep neural network model (DeepMReye) to estimate eye gaze during movie watching across three independent fMRI datasets. Model performance was evaluated by comparison with camera-based eye-tracking data when available, as well as by assessing inter-individual correlations, a commonly used benchmark in naturalistic fMRI research. At the individual level, predicted gaze showed modest correspondence with measured data (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.67). In contrast, group-averaged gaze predictions exhibited substantially higher correlations (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.8), indicating improved reliability at the group level. We further derived eye-movement-related time series from the predicted gaze signals and examined their associated brain activity. Consistent with differences in prediction accuracy, individual-level analyses yielded activation patterns largely restricted to visual cortex, whereas group-averaged predictions revealed more widespread activation, including established oculomotor control regions such as frontal and parietal eye fields. Exploratory analyses indicated age-related effects on gaze prediction accuracy and eye-movement-related brain activity, although these effects were not consistent across datasets. Together, these findings demonstrate that group-averaged fMRI-based gaze estimation can support the investigation of eye-movement-related brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, while highlighting current limitations for individual-level inference. The results provide a methodological assessment of fMRI-based gaze prediction and inform its appropriate use in future neuroimaging studies.",

      "title": "Semaglutide Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Mice",
      "content": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with emerging evidence suggesting these effects may be driven by modulation of neuroinflammation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying GLP-1 RA effects on neuroinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, we investigated how semaglutide coordinates cellular responses to resolve neuroinflammation. We find that semaglutide prevents brain infiltration of neutrophils, excessive cytokine release, and suppresses neuroinflammation-associated transcriptional signatures specifically in microglia, endothelial cells, and a subset of pericytes. Mechanistically, we identify a subset of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the dorsal vagal complex that, upon semaglutide treatment, regulate genes involved in anti-inflammatory signaling. Semaglutide-modulated pathways overlap with inflammatory signatures found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, suggesting broad relevance for conditions involving neuroinflammation. Together, these findings reveal how GLP-1R signaling orchestrates resolution of neuroinflammation through coordinated multi-cellular programs.",

      "title": "Glial vesicular transmitter release is not critical for courtship conditioning memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Glial cell function is believed to be critical for the regulation of cognitive processes such as learning and memory but the mechanisms by which glia regulate memory are still poorly elucidated. There is evidence that glial metabolic support and neurotransmitter synaptic clearance are essential for memory processes. But glial cells can also influence neuronal activity by the vesicular release of gliotransmitters in a calcium-dependent manner. Whether gliotransmission also is critical for memory process remains controversial. Here, we explored the role of gliotransmission in Drosophila courtship memory using the thermo-sensitive Shibirets mutant in combination with the UAS/Gal4 expression system, in which glial vesicular transmitter release can be rapid and reversibly impaired. We found that the formation, maintenance and decline of courtship memory were unaffected by the blockade of vesicular release of gliotransmitters. Therefore, our data support the view that the release of gliotransmitters is not an ubiquitously necessary regulatory mechanism of memory and forgetting processes.",

      "title": "Regular parental exercise before mating influences offspring lower adiposity associated to hypothalamic neurodevelopmental changes",
      "content": "Physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide and affects not only individual health but also the health of future generations. However, the impact of parental physical activity, limited to the pre-mating period, on offspring body weight and composition remains poorly understood. Using a voluntary wheel running approach in mice, we uncovered that post-weaning offspring body weight and composition changes are modulated by the combined effects of pre-mating parental exercise and parental age. Notably, during lactation, pre-mating parental exercise reduced offspring visceral and subcutaneous adiposity, shortened tibia length in female offspring, and influenced offspring transcriptomic profiles of the hypothalamus, the central region regulating body weight and energy balance. These results highlight that regular pre-mating parental exercise may induce offspring neurodevelopmental changes. Although pre-mating exercise minimally impacted the expression of lactation-related genes in maternal subcutaneous fat, as well as breastmilk nutritional composition and miRNA content, these modest miRNA changes may nonetheless influence offspring hypothalamic regulation. Together, these data provide a comprehensive understanding of how parental age and pre-mating exercise impact post-weaning offspring body weight and composition and offer deeper insights into how regular pre-mating parental exercise influences offspring physiology during lactation.",
