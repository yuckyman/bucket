      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Visuomotor adaptation enhances representational acuity without altering spatial bias",
      "content": "IntroductionPrism adaptation is a well-established paradigm for studying sensorimotor plasticity, known to produce not only motor after-effects but also changes in spatial cognition. Whether visuomotor rotation\u2014a similar form of sensorimotor adaptation\u2014elicits comparable cognitive transfer remains unclear.MethodsParticipants performed visuomotor rotation tasks involving either leftward or rightward 15\u00b0 rotations. The perturbation was introduced either abruptly (within one trial) or gradually (over 34 trials). To assess potential cognitive transfer, participants completed a perceptual line bisection task before and after adaptation.ResultsNo condition (leftward/rightward or abrupt/gradual) induced measurable cognitive after-effects in line bisection performance, indicating an absence of transfer from sensorimotor to spatial-cognitive domains. However, a novel finding emerged: visuomotor rotation enhanced participants\u2019 representational acuity, reflected in improved sensitivity when judging the midpoint of a line. This effect was most pronounced following gradual perturbations and persisted beyond the adaptation phase.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate a clear dissociation between the cognitive and perceptual consequences of visuomotor adaptation. Visuomotor rotation thus provides a reliable means to study sensorimotor plasticity without altering spatial representation\u2014a methodological advantage for investigating populations with atypical spatial biases. The enhancement of representational acuity further suggests that sensorimotor learning can refine spatial discrimination independently of cognitive recalibration.",

      "content": "Exposure to microgravity induces significant physiological, cognitive, and psychomotor changes in the human body. While countermeasures such as resistance exercise and cardiovascular conditioning have been developed to address musculoskeletal and circulatory issues, there remains a critical gap in mitigating neurophysiological and cognitive deficits caused by microgravity. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that promises to enhance psychomotor function, and cognitive performance in microgravity as well as on Earth. This article examines the challenges of spaceflight, particularly cognitive impairments and related psychomotor dysfunction, and explores the potential application of taVNS in space. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying microgravity-related decline and the proposed mechanism of action of taVNS are discussed, focusing on its effects on neuroplasticity, autonomic regulation, and sensorimotor integration. taVNS emerges as a promising countermeasure to mitigate neuropsychological impairments associated with exposure to microgravity.",

      "content": "BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing catheter ablation (CA) frequently present with cardiac structural and functional alterations and persistent memory impairment. This study aimed to investigate how cardiac structure and function impacts memory-related brain structure and function, whether CA reverses impaired memory networks, and to delineate the dual-pathway regulatory mechanism of the heart-brain axis underlying AF-associated memory deficits.MethodsThirty-eight AF patients underwent longitudinal assessments [memory function tests, clinical evaluations including blood biomarkers and cardiac function, structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] before CA and on postoperative day 7. Forty-five healthy controls (CN) were included for comparison. Hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) and voxel-based morphometry were used to quantify memory-related brain networks and gray matter (GM) volume. Bivariate correlations explored relationships between GM alterations, hippocampal FC, memory performance, and clinical features (cardiac structural parameters and blood-borne inflammatory markers).ResultsFirst, compared with CN, AF patients showed memory impairment, reduced GM volume in the bilateral calcarine cortex, cuneus, lingual gyrus, inferior/middle temporal gyri, and left fusiform gyrus, and increased hippocampal FC with the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, insula, Rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus (opercular/orbital/triangular parts), and right postcentral/supramarginal/superior temporal gyri. Second, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd) was positively associated with GM volume in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L, p = 0.016), right inferior temporal gyrus (p = 0.006), and left cuneus (p = 0.026); MTG.L GM volume correlated positively with Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)-Recall scores (p = 0.044), while hippocampal FC with the right postcentral gyrus correlated negatively with both inflammatory markers (PCT, p = 0.010) and AVLT-Delayed Recall (20 min) scores (p = 0.013). Third, post catheter ablation (post-CA), AF patients exhibited increased hippocampal FC with the right middle frontal gyrus, right midcingulate cortex, and left superior frontal gyrus, and decreased FC with the right lingual gyrus and calcarine cortex.ConclusionCardiac structural parameters (LVDd) associate with memory-related brain atrophy, whereas blood-borne inflammatory markers link to hippocampal memory network dysregulation\u2014two distinct pathways driving AF-related memory impairment. These findings clarify the dual-pathway regulatory mechanism of the heart-brain axis, offering novel insights into AF-associated cognitive dysfunction and potential CA-mediated memory recovery.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) and Vertical electrooculography (VEOG) were recorded concurrently, while subjective questionnaires were administered to assess visual fatigue and alertness.ResultsCompared with linearly polarized displays, circularly polarized displays were associated with significantly smaller increases in subjective visual fatigue and smaller declines in alertness (ps < 0.05). Blink rate remained stable under circular polarization but increased significantly under linear polarization and higher than in circular polarization (p < 0.05). EEG analyses revealed that circular polarization preserved stable neural activity, whereas linear polarization elicited a significant increase in the (\u03b8 + \u03b1)/\u03b2 ratio and a significant decrease in alpha centroid frequency (ps < 0.05), indicating reduced cortical activation and slowed neural processing.ConclusionCircularly polarized displays, by more closely resembling the optical properties of natural light, can effectively mitigate visual fatigue induced by prolonged screen viewing. These findings provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to inform the development of healthier display technologies and ergonomics-related standards.",

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",
