      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "Prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized by facial distortions. This report presents the first thorough study of a case of PMO that emerged early in life. Zed, age 15 at the time of testing, has experienced lifelong, dynamic facial distortions in which features move, droop, disappear, expand, shrink, and rotate. He also experiences identity misrecognitions, in which he perceives familiar faces as strangers and vice versa (e.g., seeing his grandfather when viewing a young woman). Behavioral assessments indicate that Zed's distortions occur across viewpoints, visual field positions, picture-plane orientations, and visual angles. Neuropsychological testing revealed face identity recognition deficits, yet, despite his facial distortions, Zed can make accurate fine-grained perceptual judgments about facial age and sex. Structural MRI showed no lesions, but face-selectivity in two right posterior face-selective areas was reduced, and diffusion tensor imaging revealed lower white matter integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Zed's case offers new insights into early-emerging PMO, its manifestations, co-occurrence with other face-processing disorders, and underlying neural correlates.",

      "title": "Reverberation exacerbates effects of interruption on auditory spatial selective attention",
      "content": "Everyday listening requires focusing on one talker while ignoring competing sounds, a process challenged by reverberation and unexpected distractions. Here, we asked whether reverberation decreases effects of distractions by reducing the salience of new onsets, or compounds disruption by increasing task difficulty. Across five online experiments, participants recalled spatialized syllable streams presented with or without interrupters under pseudo-anechoic and reverberant conditions. Interrupters consistently impaired recall, especially the syllables following the interrupter. For the syllable immediately after the interruption, this effect was larger in reverberation than in anechoic conditions. These results demonstrate that distractions are especially disruptive in reverberant settings.",

      "title": "Multi-timescale Rhythmic Dynamics in Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Neurons",
      "content": "Neural circuits involved in sensory control must integrate fast, reflexive responses with slower, state-dependent modulation. This coordination is especially critical in the pain system, where rapid withdrawal must be balanced against slower adjustments in nociceptive sensitivity that reflect arousal, physiology, and internal state. We hypothesized that neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), the principal brainstem node for descending pain control, operate across multiple temporal scales, combining fast stimulus-evoked responses with slower intrinsic dynamics. Using single-unit recordings from identified RVM ON-, OFF-, and NEUTRAL-cells and probabilistic modeling, we find that ON- and OFF-cells exhibit multi-phase population responses characterized by rapid activation and prolonged recovery dynamics lasting tens of seconds. In the absence of stimulation, the same neurons display coherent, quasi-periodic oscillations on the order of minutes, captured by Gaussian process models as predictable, low-frequency fluctuations. These rhythmic dynamics were specific to ON- and OFF-cells and occasionally coherent with autonomic parameters, suggesting coupling between nociceptive and homeostatic control loops. Together, these results identify a multi-timescale organizational principle within descending brainstem circuits, in which fast, reflex-related and slow, rhythmic processes jointly structure sensory modulation and internal state control.",

      "title": "Sleep-modulated disinhibition enables replay for memory consolidation, accelerated by ripples",
      "content": "Memory consolidation involves elusive neural mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysically detailed model of the entorhinal-hippocampal-cortical network to reveal that disinhibition drives synaptic and systems consolidation. Transitioning to slow-wave sleep via neuromodulatory dampening of inhibition generates up-down states and spontaneous, time-compressed replays of spatial sequences encoded with theta-phase precession. Lateral inhibition levels unify physiological and pathological ripple diversity. Cortical disinhibition enables memory transfer from hippocampus. Weakened afferent CA1 synapses eliminate ripples but spare replays, proposing strategies to mitigate ripple disruptions. Replays sustain systems consolidation even without ripples, albeit slower; excessive weakening halts it, rescuable by enhanced hippocampal-to-cortical connectivity. Inducing disinhibition during wakefulness--mimicking medial-entorhinal-cortex-input-dependent quiet wakefulness replay--activates these processes, underscoring disinhibition's state-agnostic role. These insights elucidate disinhibition's centrality in engraining memories and fostering hippocampal independence, reconciling empirical observations, yielding testable predictions, and identifying therapeutic avenues for memory disorders.",

      "title": "Temporal contrast enhancement generalizes across pain and auditory modalities",
      "content": "The human brain continuously processes sensory inputs whose perceptual impact depends on stimulus intensity, salience, and context. Temporal filtering shapes this processing by dynamically modulating neural responses according to stimulus repetition, temporal structure, and predictive contingencies. Higher-order percepts such as pain are likewise a subject to temporal filtering, as exemplified by temporal contrast enhancement (TCE), a stimulation paradigm eliciting pain inhibition. However, given the prevalence of filtering mechanisms across sensory domains, it remains unclear whether TCE is specific to pain or represents a supramodal filtering mechanism. Here, we contrasted behavioral and neurophysiological responses, including electroencephalography and pupillometry, in a TCE paradigm for painful heat versus uncomfortable auditory stimulation. We sought to establish whether TCE generalizes across modalities and bases on similar or distinct underlying neurophysiological processes. Human participants took part in either a purely behavioral investigation (n = 33) or in a neurophysiological and behavioral investigation (n = 29). Both painful heat and loud sounds induced TCE effects, suggesting a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific temporal dynamics. Increasing pupil size and decreasing power of neural alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) with higher painful heat indicate bottom-up modulation of the autonomic nervous system and a release of neural inhibition, respectively. Critically, expectation of pain - but not loud sound - induced an alpha power increase, demonstrating to-down contributions to temporal filtering of pain. However, no direct neurophysiological correlates of subjectively experienced TCE effects were found. Findings suggests that a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific neurophysiological dynamics shapes the processing of aversive stimulation.",
