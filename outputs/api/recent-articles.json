      "content": "arXiv:2601.08652v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Every day life tasks can present significant challenges for neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) who are characterized by specific sensitivities. This contribution describes a virtual reality system that allows neurodivergent individuals to experience everyday situations in order to practice and implement strategies for overcoming their daily challenges. The key strength of the proposed system is the automatic personalization of the virtual environment, based on both the individual's abilities and their specific training needs. The proposed method has been evaluated on four synthetic user profiles, also proposing a metric able to evaluate the variance of the features within the same difficulty level. The results show that the method can produce a significant number of scenarios for the various difficulty levels. Furthermore, within the same difficulty, there is a wide variance of the non-constrained features for the specific profile.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08565v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Video is a powerful medium for communication and storytelling, yet reauthoring existing footage remains challenging. Even simple edits often demand expertise, time, and careful planning, constraining how creators envision and shape their narratives. Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm. Our work contributes empirical insights into the opportunities and challenges of text-driven video reauthoring, offering design implications for future co-creative video tools.",

      "title": "Characterizing Personality from Eye-Tracking: The Role of Gaze and Its Absence in Interactive Search Environments",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.08287v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Personality traits influence how individuals engage, behave, and make decisions during the information-seeking process. However, few studies have linked personality to observable search behaviors. This study aims to characterize personality traits through a multimodal time-series model that integrates eye-tracking data and gaze missingness-periods when the user's gaze is not captured. This approach is based on the idea that people often look away when they think, signaling disengagement or reflection. We conducted a user study with 25 participants, who used an interactive application on an iPad, allowing them to engage with digital artifacts from a museum. We rely on raw gaze data from an eye tracker, minimizing preprocessing so that behavioral patterns can be preserved without substantial data cleaning. From this perspective, we trained models to predict personality traits using gaze signals. Our results from a five-fold cross-validation study demonstrate strong predictive performance across all five dimensions: Neuroticism (Macro F1 = 77.69%), Conscientiousness (74.52%), Openness (77.52%), Agreeableness (73.09%), and Extraversion (76.69%). The ablation study examines whether the absence of gaze information affects the model performance, demonstrating that incorporating missingness improves multimodal time-series modeling. The full model, which integrates both time-series signals and missingness information, achieves 10-15% higher accuracy and macro F1 scores across all Big Five traits compared to the model without time-series signals and missingness. These findings provide evidence that personality can be inferred from search-related gaze behavior and demonstrate the value of incorporating missing gaze data into time-series multimodal modeling.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08256v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Making sense of a visualization requires the reader to consider both the visualization design and the underlying data values. Existing work in the visualization community has largely considered affordances driven by visualization design elements, such as color or chart type, but how visual design interacts with data values to impact interpretation and reasoning has remained under-explored. Dot plots and bar graphs are commonly used to help users identify groups of points that form trends and clusters, but are liable to manifest groupings that are artifacts of spatial arrangement rather than inherent patterns in the data itself. These ``Data-induced Groups'' can drive suboptimal data comparisons and potentially lead the user to incorrect conclusions. We conduct two user studies using dot plots as a case study to understand the prevalence of data-induced groupings. We find that users rely on data-induced groupings in both conditions despite the fact that trend-based groupings are irrelevant in nominal data. Based on the study results, we build a model to predict whether users are likely to perceive a given set of dot plot points as a group. We discuss two use cases illustrating how the model can assist visualization designers by both diagnosing potential user-perceived groupings in dot plots and offering redesigns that better accentuate desired groupings through data rearrangement.",

However, the sensitive use case of mental health demands thoughtful integration with mental health concepts and a comprehensive understanding of prior literature. This paper presents a scoping literature review of the ISMAR, IEEEVR, and TVCG communities to assess the contributions of the XR community to the mental health serious game domain and explore potential weaknesses and strengths for future work by XR researchers. To this end, this review identified 204 possibly relevant articles in the XR community and fully evaluated 6 XR serious games for mental health. This relatively small number of articles for final inclusion suggests that XR mental health serious games are largely underexplored by the XR community (or not reported within the XR community). There is value in exploring the existing literature space as it is. Thus, this paper evaluates these six papers in terms of game elements and underlying psychological foundations, and discuss future directions for XR researchers in this wide-open research space within our community.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational agents are increasingly expected to adapt across contexts and evolve their personalities through interactions, yet most remain static once configured. We present an exploratory study of how user expectations form and evolve when agent personality is made dynamically adjustable. To investigate this, we designed a prototype conversational interface that enabled users to adjust an agent's personality along eight research-grounded dimensions across three task contexts: informational, emotional, and appraisal. We conducted an online mixed-methods study with 60 participants, employing latent profile analysis to characterize personality classes and trajectory analysis to trace evolving patterns of personality adjustment. These approaches revealed distinct personality profiles at initial and final configuration stages, and adjustment trajectories, shaped by context-sensitivity. Participants also valued the autonomy, perceived the agent as more anthropomorphic, and reported greater trust. Our findings highlight the importance of designing conversational agents that adapt alongside their users, advancing more responsive and human-centred AI.",

Augmented reality has shown promise as an assistive tool for high-stress work domains and MCI triage both in the field and for pre-field training. However, the vulnerability of MCIs makes it challenging to evaluate new tools designed to enhance MCI response. In other words, profound evolutions like the integration of augmented reality into field response require thorough proof-of-concept evaluations before being launched into real-world response. This paper describes two progressive simulation strategies for augmented reality that bridge the gap between computer-based simulation and actual field response.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08178v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modelling users' online decision-making and opinion change is a complex issue that needs to consider users' personal determinants, the nature of the topic and the information retrieval activities. Furthermore, generative-AIbased products like ChatGPT gradually become an essential element for the retrieval of online information. However, the interaction between domainspecific knowledge and AI-generated content during online decision-making is unclear. We conducted a lab-based explanatory sequential study with university students to overcome this research gap. In the experiment, we surveyed participants about a set of general domain topics that are easy to grasp and another set of domain-specific topics that require adequate levels of chemical science knowledge to fully comprehend. We provided participants with decision-supporting information that was either produced using generative AI or collected from selected expert human-written sources to explore the role of AI-generated content compared to ordinary information during decision-making. Our result revealed that participants are less likely to change opinions on domain-specific topics. Since participants without professional knowledge had difficulty performing in-depth and independent reasoning based on the information, they favoured relying on conclusions presented in the provided materials and tended to stick to their initial opinion. Besides, information that is labelled as AI-generated is equivalently helpful as information labelled as dedicatedly human-written for participants in this experiment, indicating the vast potential as well as concerns for AI replacing human experts to help users tackle professional topics or issues.",

Yet most systems are designed to optimise retrieval rather than to help users develop better search strategies or critical awareness. This paper introduces a pedagogical perspective on information access, conceptualising search and conversational systems as instructive interfaces that can teach, guide, and scaffold users' learning. We draw on seven didactic frameworks from education and behavioural science to analyse how existing and emerging system features, including query suggestions, source labels, and conversational or agentic AI, support or limit user learning. Using two illustrative search tasks, we demonstrate how different design choices promote skills such as critical evaluation, metacognitive reflection, and strategy transfer. The paper contributes a conceptual lens for evaluating the instructional value of information access systems and outlines design implications for technologies that foster more effective, reflective, and resilient information seekers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals into physiological activity, pathological (epileptic) activity, power-line noise, and other non-cerebral artifacts. Traditional methods for iEEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of iEEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,231 samples using a 70/20/10 split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous non-specialized CNN- and LSTM-based approaches and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model achieves high discrimination of noise and artifact classes, with precisions of 0.98 and approximately 1, respectively. Classification between physiological and pathological signals exhibits a modest but clinically interpretable overlap, with F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.90 and 175 and 272 cross-class false positives, respectively, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well-suited for iEEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling the capture of both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The study also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning, the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, and normalization steps that support high model performance. While the results demonstrate strong in-distribution performance, generalizability across datasets and clinical settings has yet to be established.",

      "content": "arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

      "title": "Modulating task outcome value to mitigate real-world procrastination via noninvasive brain stimulation",
      "content": "arXiv:2506.21000v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a 6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not by simply reducing negative feelings about the task.

      "title": "Stable Filtering for Efficient Dimensionality Reduction of Streaming Manifold Data",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.08685v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08478v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the \"two-hit vascular hypothesis\" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08818v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08285v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Selective attention can momentarily alter visual appearance, but can such effects be learned? We tested whether training attention under sensory competition produces lasting changes in perceived contrast. Across seven days, participants trained on an orientation task with a fixed target location, with or without a salient distractor. Before and after training, we measured the point of subjective equality (PSE). Training under competition produced a reliable push-pull shift. Stimuli at the trained location appeared higher in contrast, whereas stimuli at the untrained location appeared lower. Conversely, training without distractors improved performance but did not alter appearance. Crucially, these opponent shifts were robust to task variations, persisting even in equality judgments designed to minimize response bias. Furthermore, the effect generalized to stimuli with novel orientation and contrast levels. These findings demonstrate that resolving sensory competition does not merely improve discrimination, but durably recalibrates the subjective appearance of the visual world.",

Therefore, biomechanics and environmental context must be considered to dissect algorithms for behavioral control. This is enabled by leveraging neuromechanical digital twins: computational models that embed artificial neural controllers within realistic body models in simulated environments. Here we review advances in the creation and use of neuromechanical digital twins while also highlighting emerging opportunities for the future. First, we illustrate how neuromechanical models allow researchers to infer hidden biophysical variables that may be difficult to measure experimentally. Additionally, by perturbing these models, one can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses. Next, we explore how neuromechanical twins have been used to foster a deeper exchange between neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Finally, we show how neuromechanical twins can advance healthcare. We envision that coupling studies on animals with active probing of their neuromechanical twins will greatly accelerate neuroscientific discovery.",

      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",
