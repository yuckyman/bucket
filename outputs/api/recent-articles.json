      "title": "The intersection of near-death experiences (NDEs) and traumatic brain injury (TBI): neurobiological, phenomenological, and creative implications",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and near-death experiences (NDEs) represent profound disruptions in brain function, often associated with dramatic changes in consciousness, self-perception, and behavior. While these events are typically studied for their pathological consequences, a growing body of evidence suggests they may also trigger unexpected cognitive and creative enhancements in a subset of individuals. We explore the intersection between TBI, NDEs, and the emergence of heightened artistic expression, integrating findings from neuroanatomy, neuropathology, genetics, and phenomenology. We examine how alterations in key brain networks - such as the default mode network, frontoparietal circuits, and limbic regions - may underpin shifts in self-awareness, emotion processing, and symbolic thinking, which are frequently reported after NDEs or severe brain trauma. Additionally, we discuss the potential role of neuroplasticity, diaschisis, and compensatory reorganization in facilitating novel patterns of cognition and creative output following injury. Genetic factors potentially influencing susceptibility to such transformations are considered, alongside evolutionary perspectives on why these rare post-injury enhancements may occur. By synthesizing clinical cases, neuroscientific studies, and first-person accounts, we argue that certain brain injuries and altered states of consciousness can function as catalysts for reconfiguration of cognitive and emotional systems, leading to emergent artistic abilities or intensified creative insight. These phenomena challenge traditional dichotomies between damage and function, pathology and creativity, and invite new frameworks for understanding the plastic potential of the human brain. This overview-hypothesis driven article aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how the mind and brain interact under extreme conditions and how these interactions may unlock hidden reservoirs of human potential. The paper highlights the need for systematic research into post-traumatic and NDE-related cognitive changes, not only to improve clinical outcomes but also to broaden our knowledge of human consciousness and creativity.",

      "title": "Energy Landscape Analysis Reveals Thalamic Modulation of Brain State Transitions During Movie Watching",
      "content": "Understanding how large-scale brain networks dynamically coordinate during complex, real-world experiences remains a crucial topic in contemporary neuroscience. Leveraging naturalistic paradigm, this study employed energy landscape modeling to characterize the temporal dynamics of brain state transitions and their functional significance. Using the Sherlock fMRI dataset, we identified two dominant brain states: a perception- and attention-oriented state, and an introspective, integrative state, each associated with distinct canonical brain networks. State transitions were differentially associated with the recruitment of these networks and manifested as either the \"easy\" or \"hard\" route, depending on the energy required for the transition. Notably, we demonstrated that the probability of specific state transitions robustly predicted inter-subject correlation within three clusters: subcortical-rich, salience/attention-rich, and DMN-rich regions. This indicates that flexible reorganization of cortical networks underlies shared neural engagement during ecologically valid experiences. Critically, the thalamus emerged as a central modulator, displaying activity changes and dynamic nucleus-specific thalamocortical connectivity changes tied to distinct transition profiles. Together, our findings shed light on the energetic and network mechanisms that orchestrate brain dynamics during naturalistic cognition and underscore the pivotal role of cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in governing flexible, collective neural responses to richly structured real-life stimuli.",

      "title": "Micronuclear collapse under oxidative stress drives amphisome-mediated export of DNA in Parkinson disease",
      "content": "The diversity of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations and their impact on intercellular communication are increasingly recognized, but how organelle dysfunction shapes EV content in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Mitochondrial and lysosomal functional defects are hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD). Here we uncover a novel pathway linking this dysfunctional axis to EV remodeling and immune activation. We show that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce genomic instability and micronuclei formation in PD fibroblasts, with ruptured micronuclei being sequestered into amphisomes and exported through small EVs. These EVs are enriched in oxidized mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which potently stimulate microglial inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, this work identifies micronuclei not as passive byproducts of genome instability but as active intermediates in EV cargo loading. Importantly, treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant AntiOxCIN4 elicited a mitohormetic response, enhancing ATM - mediated DNA damage repair, restoring mitochondrial dynamics, and improving lysosomal function. This reduced the incorporation of oxidized DNA into EVs and blunted their pro- inflammatory activity. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction drives the release of DNA-enriched EVs that fuel neuroinflammation in a neurodegenerative context. Targeting mitochondrial quality control to limit oxidized cargo in EVs emerges as a potential strategy to mitigate early inflammatory events in PD.",

      "title": "Behavioural and Physiological Signatures of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Models in Mice",
      "content": "The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm is one of the most widely used preclinical models to investigate the role of stress in the neurobiology of depression and to evaluate potential antidepressant therapies, owing to its strong translational relevance. However, despite its extensive use, substantial discrepancies and concerns regarding the reproducibility of CUMS outcomes persist in the literature, with many studies reporting inconsistent or unreliable results. In the present comparative study, we implemented several CUMS protocols in mice that differed in the intensity and duration of stress exposure, and systematically evaluated the resulting pathophysiological and behavioural alterations associated with depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes. We found that progressive escalation in stress intensity and frequency, as well as prolonged exposure, induced increasingly robust disease-related behavioural and physiological changes, including depression- and anxiety-like behaviours, adrenal hypertrophy, and reduced body weight gain.. Moreover, social isolation emerged as a major contributing factor exacerbating stress-induced deficits. Altogether, data suggest that a multidimensional assessment of the behavioural impairments is critical to reinforce the physiological changes indicative of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Differences in individual stress susceptibility, stressor intensity, frequency, and housing conditions are key determinants of CUMS outcomes. Therefore, precise, detailed, and transparent reporting of protocol parameters is critical to enhance reproducibility and enable meaningful comparisons across studies.",

      "title": "Therapeutic Potential of Neural Rosette Stem Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles in the Management of Brain Edema",
      "content": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) represent an interesting option for developing in vitro disease models and drug screening assays due to their differentiation capacity into neurons and glial cells. Additionally, NSCs are under investigation in on-going clinical trials for treatment of various human neurological disorders. NSCs can be isolated from the central nervous system or derived in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the current methods for generating NSCs typically include a phase of neural rosette formation and subsequent manual isolation of these tiny structures. As this is a laborious process characterized by operator-dependent variability and scalability challenges, there is a pressing need to develop optimized and scalable protocols to obtain pure NSC populations. In this study, we present a new method for generating highly pure and expandable dorsal forebrain FOXG1+OTX2+TLE4+SOX5+ neural rosette stem cell (NRSC) lines without the necessity for manual isolation of rosette structures. Our findings demonstrate the reproducibility of this protocol through the characterization of different NRSC lines over multiple passages, highlighting the robustness of the process. These NRSCs can be expanded for at least 12 passages without compromising their rosette-formation capacity or their initial dorsal forebrain identity. Furthermore, we show the differentiation capacity of these NRSCs to generate pure populations of TUBB3+ neurons, and under specific conditions, their ability to differentiate into early glial progenitor cells including GFAP+ astrocytes and O4+ oligodendrocytes. Collectively, these results show the capabilities of our protocol to generate an expandable NRSC population suitable for in vitro disease modeling and drug screening, while also suggesting a viable strategy for scalable NRSC production for clinical application.",

      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with severe motor, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. There is a recent impetus to develop treatments that slow progression before clinical signs emerge. Such early interventions require biomarkers sensitive to the very earliest HD progression. Here we applied cutting-edge fMRI analysis on data collected in the Track-On HD study to evaluate whether functional and effective connectivity obtained from model-free and model-based approaches can produce useful biomarkers of HD progression. We analyzed data from 231 participants with up to three annual visits each and created five groups comprising normative controls and four HD groups according to the Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS). We found significant differences across the HD-ISS stages but not in their longitudinal change. Specifically, we found attenuated functional and effective connectivity in the caudate nucleus in HD-ISS-2, and this effect extended to other corticostriatal connections in HD-ISS-3. Overall, most of the alterations were only evident in advanced HD stages, and we did not observe widespread alterations in cortical connectivity and graph topography. Although HD-ISS groups did not differ in the amount of in-scanner motion, we did find measures of functional and effective connectivity to be sensitive to motion. We conclude that fMRI can indeed capture attenuation of cortico-striatal functional and effective connectivity across HD progression. This is the first study to investigate fMRI alterations across the recently created HD-ISS stages within a novel framework of signal flow across the whole brain.",

      "title": "The atypical antidepressant tianeptine causes opioid-receptor-dependent beta oscillations in the rat hippocampus",
      "content": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer. Previous research indicates that its antidepressant-like efficacy in animals depends on the phosphorylation of GluA1-subunit-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and the activation of mu-opioid receptors on hippocampal interneurons. Both actions might alter synaptic strength and network activity; we therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on evoked synaptic responses and local-field-potential (LFP) oscillations in area CA1 of male urethane-anaesthetised rats. Electrodes were implanted to record CA1 LFP and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) elicited by stimulation of CA3. A temperature probe was implanted in the contralateral hippocampus. Subcutaneous injection of tianeptine (10 & 30 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in hippocampal beta-frequency activity and a modest increase in fEPSP slope that were blocked by the opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone. Injection of the opioid buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) had similar effects, but ketamine (10 mg/kg), another atypical antidepressant, caused a distinct pattern of LFP changes characterised by a naloxone-insensitive increase in slow-gamma activity. Injection of 30 mg/kg tianeptine and buprenorphine was associated with an increase in brain temperature of ~0.6 degrees C, sufficient to fully explain the increase in fEPSP slope, but not the increase in LFP activity. Injection of tianeptine also caused a reduction in the amplitude of the inhibitory tail of the fEPSP, consistent with a blockade of feedforward inhibition. These results indicate that tianeptine, like several other atypical antidepressant drugs, enhances hippocampal beta/gamma-frequency LFP activity. This action is dependent on opioid-receptor activation and may depend on the disinhibition of principal neurons, a possibility that we are exploring.",

      "title": "High-Fat Diet Induces Epigenetic and Metabolic Changes in Kisspeptin Neurons in Association with Obesity and Male Secondary Hypogonadism",
      "content": "Background: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major risk factors for male hypogonadism, a disorder with multi-system impacts on health. However, the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated male secondary hypogonadism remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to dissect dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis and elucidate the underlying epigenetic mechanisms using a high-fat diet mouse model. Methods: Male C57BL6 mice were fed standard chow or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) for 16 weeks starting from 6-week of age. Plasma testosterone levels, sperm counts, and gonadotropin responses to senktide and kisspeptin peptide stimulation were assessed. HFD-induced transcription changes in the ARC were evaluted using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. Genome-wide changes in 5hmC were analzyed by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq). Functional relevance of 5hmC changes was evaluated by ectopic TET expression in an immortalized ARC Kiss1 neuron cell line and qRT-PCR. Results: HFD-fed mice induced obesity, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance, indicative of the development of type 2 diabetes-like metabolic disorder. This was accompanied by low testosterone, reduced sperm counts, and unchanged basal LH, consistent with obesity/T2D-associated male secondary hypogonadism observed clinically. Impaired LH responses to senktide, a Kisspeptin neuron activator, but not to kisspeptin peptide, identified suppressed Kiss1 neuron function as a key mechanism underlying secondary hypogonadism. RNA-seq revealed dysregulation of metabolic and neural pathways in Kiss1 neurons. hMeDIP-seq revealed widespread 5hmC alterations in the ARC of HFD-induced obese/diabetic mice correlated with the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism, neuronal activity, and synapse function pathways. Ectopic TET expression ex vivo in Kiss1 neuronal cell lines restored 5hmC levels and upregulated key metabolic and neuronal genes that were repressed in the ARC of DIO mice. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that Kiss1 neurons are highly sensitive to diet and metabolic changes, and that obesity/diabetes-induced 5hmC modifications play a key role in dysregulating the metabolic and neuronal pathways in Kiss1 neurons. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking metabolic disturbances to reproductive dysfunction through direct effects on Kiss1 neurons.",

      "title": "Disentangling Superpositions: Interpretable Brain Encoding Model with Sparse Concept Atoms",
      "content": "Encoding models based on word embeddings or artificial neural network (ANN) features reliably predict brain responses to naturalistic stimuli but remain difficult to interpret. A central limitation is superposition - the entanglement of distinct semantic features along correlated directions in dense embeddings, which arises when latent features outnumber the embedding dimensions. This entanglement renders regression weights non-identifiable: different combinations of semantic directions can produce identical predicted brain activity, preventing principled interpretation of voxel selectivity. To overcome this, we introduce the Sparse Concept Encoding Model, which transforms dense embeddings into a higher-dimensional, sparse, and non-negative space of learned concept atoms. This transformation yields an axis-aligned semantic basis where each dimension corresponds to an interpretable concept, enabling direct readout of conceptual selectivity from voxel weights. When applied to fMRI data collected during story listening, our model matches the prediction performance of conventional dense models while substantially enhancing interpretability. It enables novel neuroscientific analyses such as disentangling overlapping cortical representations of time, space, and number, and revealing structured similarity among distributed conceptual maps. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable bridge between ANN-derived features and human conceptual representations in the brain.",

      "content": "Imbalances in gut microbiota composition and microbiota-associated metabolites have been linked with several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, a comprehensive multi-biofluid approach remains lacking. Most studies on MS include patients already receiving treatment and often neglect to account for sex-related differences, which could serve as potential confounding factors. Moreover, they mostly investigate only stools or plasma metabolomics. In this study, we recruited 18 treatment-naive neuroinflammatory patients at diagnosis and compared them with 20 healthy controls, matched for sex and age. We conducted multi-biofluids metabolomic analysis of urine, stool, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, complemented by taxonomical and functional profiling of the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results show that MS patients exhibit distinct microbiome composition and urinary metabolomic profiles compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, neuroinflammation is associated with dysregulation of microbially-produced short-chain fatty acids, their intestinal absorption and systemic bioavailability, as illustrated by the altered plasma levels.",

      "title": "Transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value update for meta-learning",
      "content": "Value computation is fundamental to the survival of animals. Classical models suggest value is stored in synaptic weight through plasticity whereas more recent theories propose that recurrent network dynamics can encode and update value independently of synaptic change. Although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, the condition under which each dominates remain unclear. Here we show that environmental stability determines the neural mechanism underlying value updating. In stable environments, mice rely on synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), supporting value memory that persists for over a week. In contrast, in dynamic environments, mice gradually transition to a recurrent dynamics-based value update, with value memory degrading after ~2 minutes. A recurrent neural network (RNN) endowed with online weight updating recapitulates experimental data, exhibiting a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation. Synaptic plasticity blockade in the BLA impaired initial value updating in the stable environment but not expert value updating in the dynamic environment, consistent with the RNN model. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic inactivation reveal that BLA encodes both stable and dynamic value and is required for performing in both environments. Lastly, the transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation allowed both RNNs and mice to use task knowledge to infer value, allowing value update without direct experience. Overall, our work provides a new framework to understand value computation in the brain and suggests that meta-learning may emerge via a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation.",
