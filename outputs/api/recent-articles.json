      "title": "CTSSP: A temporal\u2013spectral-spatial joint optimization algorithm for motor imagery EEG decoding",
      "content": "Objective. Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for neurorehabilitation, yet their performance is often compromised by electroencephalography (EEG) non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe cross-session variability. Current decoding methods typically suffer from fragmented optimization, treating temporal, spectral, and spatial features in isolation. Approach. We propose common temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns (CTSSP), a unified framework that jointly optimizes filters across all three domains. The algorithm integrates: (1) multi-scale temporal segmentation to capture dynamic neural evolution, (2) channel-adaptive finite impulse response filters to enhance task-relevant rhythms, and (3) low-rank regularization to improve generalization. Main results. Evaluated across five public datasets, CTSSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. It yielded mean accuracies of 76.9% (within-subject), 68.8% (cross-session), and 69.8% (cross-subject). In within-subject and cross-session scenarios, CTSSP significantly outperformed competing baselines by margins of 2.6%\u201314.6% (p < 0.001) and 2.3%\u201313.8% (p < 0.05), respectively. In cross-subject tasks, it achieved the highest average accuracy, proving competitive against deep learning models. Neurophysiological visualization confirms that the learned filters align closely with motor cortex activation mechanisms. Significance. CTSSP effectively overcomes the limitations of decoupled feature extraction by extracting robust, interpretable, and coupled temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns. It offers a powerful, data-efficient solution for decoding MI EEG in noisy, non-stationary environments. The code is available at https://github.com/PLC-TJU/CTSSP.",

      "title": "Automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from micro-computed tomography images using anatomy-aware neural networks",
      "content": "Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT volumes (11.4 \u03bcm isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net\u2019s performance against a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to a 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle instance detection. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors (topological and morphological implausibility) by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
