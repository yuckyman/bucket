      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Inhibitory GABAergic neuron loss due to oxidative damage during ex vivo acute brain slice preparation influences genesis and dynamics of epileptiform activity",
      "content": "Ex vivo acute brain slice is a popular technique in neuroscience research. Since its inception five decades ago, many variations of the brain slice preparation method have emerged. While all variations are currently used by many labs throughout the world, no study has comprehensively examined the impact of these variation on the quality of the acute brain slice preparation. In this study, we comprehensively examined the effect of animal sacrifice methods (decapitation or transcardial perfusion) and cutting solution (normal or sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid) on brain slice preparation. Neuronal population was quantified by immunohistochemistry against various neuronal markers. Neuronal dynamics was evaluated by in vitro electrophysiology using two acute epilepsy models-zero-magnesium and 4-aminopyridine. To modulate the stress incurred in acute brain slice preparation, we administered antioxidants or HIF-1 inhibitor, chrysin, to the cutting solution. The method of brain slice preparation significantly affected the quality of the brain slice preparation. In general, the combination of transcardial perfusion and sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid produces the optimal brain slice preparation. This is evidenced by a preservation of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in slices prepared with this combination. We subsequently found that this loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons significantly influenced the genesis and dynamics of induced acute epileptiform activity. The slices with preserved inhibition had less successful induction of acute epileptiform activity and a seizure-like event that is typical of those induced in brain with preserved inhibition. Finally, we found that loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons during brain slice preparation is primarily due to oxidative damage. Limiting oxidative stress is an effective neuroprotection strategy to prevent loss of inhibition in brain slice preparation. In conclusion, consideration of brain slice preparation method is crucial in preserving inhibitory GABAergic neurons and the degree of inhibition in ex vivo acute brain slice preparation.",

      "title": "WSB.APP/PS1 mice develop age-dependent cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebrovascular deficits, and white matter damage, which are modified by humanized APOE alleles.",
      "content": "Vascular contributions are now widely accepted to play a key role in many cases of dementia, including Alzheimers disease (AD), that commonly manifest as cerebral small vessel diseases, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the mechanisms by which vascular contributions such as CAA contribute dementias such as AD are not well understood. This is due in part to the lack mouse models that develop robust CAA, hampering our ability to develop therapies that target vascular deficits. To address this, we have explored the use of distinct genetic contexts to enhance the face validity of mouse models for AD. We have previously identified the WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain as a model that shows increased susceptibility to CAA in the presence of the APP/PS1 amyloid driver, compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Here, we now perform an in-depth characterization of WSB.APP/PS1 and its WSB wild type (WT) counterpart, assessing male and female mice, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age (M). We show that WSB.APP/PS1 mice show mild CAA at 8M, with robust CAA being apparent at 14M. Transcriptional profiling showed strong correlation to AMP-AD gene expression modules highlighting the human relevance of WSB.APP/PS1 mice and predicted white matter deficits at 14M that was confirmed by immunofluorescence. PET/CT showed blood flow and metabolic deficits, and modifications in small vessel morphology in 8M WSB.APP/PS1 compared to WSB WT mice. We tested whether cerebrovascular reactivity deficits in WSB WT mice may underly the susceptibility to CAA, but interestingly, they did not show age-dependent decline in reactivity that was observed in B6 mice. Finally, using an allelic series of humanized apolipoprotein E (APOE), we show that APOE4 increased the extent of CAA in WSB.APP/PS1 mice, compared to APOE2 and APOE3, but in a sex-dependent manner. Collectively, these data show the utility of the WSB strain to uncover mechanisms of vascular contributions to Alzheimers disease and related dementias.",

      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",
