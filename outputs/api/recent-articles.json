      "title": "A System for Live Sorting of Neuronal Spiking Activity from Large-scale Recordings",
      "content": "Online monitoring and quantification of neural signals has tremendous value both for neurofeedback experiments and for brain-computer interfaces. Unfortunately, established methods of online monitoring primarily involve the use of thresholded neural activity rather than sorted single-neuron spikes. The recent introduction of large-scale, high-density electrophysiology has enabled the recording of activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in both model organisms and human participants. This development highlights the need for a robust and easily implementable system for sorting spikes during data collection for live analyses of neuronal signals. Here, we describe a system for live sorting of neuronal activity (LSS) based on the widely used Kilosort platform. The LSS workflow utilizes an initial period of recorded neural data to identify waveform templates using Kilosort. LSS then interfaces with the SpikeGLX API to retrieve small batches (e.g. 50 ms) of data and for processing online. We measured the similarity of single-neuron activity sorted live by LSS to that sorted offline in neurophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex using Neuropixels probes. We show that LSS closely replicates the post-stimulus time histograms and visual response tuning curves of single-neurons obtained using offline sorting. Furthermore, we show that decoding neural signals online with LSS consistently outperforms online decoding of thresholded activity, and that LSS can achieve the same performance as that obtained with offline sorting.",

      "title": "The Role of Synchronization of Neural Modules in Pattern Processing inthe Visual System",
      "content": "Key operations in modeling visual processing in living systems are those that process a pattern as a holistic object, for example, in pattern recognition to ensure invariance to translation and rotation. In this article, we describe a neural module we synthesized for moving a pattern along a cortical layer without losing its shape. The module has the form of a three-layer neural network with two types of inhibitory neurons, one of which is a universal prohibition logic element. Modeling showed that such operations can be implemented using the proposed neural module by additionally synchronizing its operation using endogenous pacemakers with a gamma rhythm frequency. The mechanism of such synchronization is similar to the clock sweep mechanism in electronics. We believe we have clearly demonstrated the possible role of gamma-based brain activity as a mechanism for synchronizing computations in living neural networks for the first time. This opens up new possibilities for constructing neuromorphic architectures for real-time visual recognition.",

Dealta replaces reputation with a Nash Equilibrium-based mechanism. We use staked, pseudo-randomly selected \"Brokers\" to physically verify goods. The protocol ensures that honesty is the dominant strategy for all actors via strict payoff matrices. It intended use is preferably trading of mid to high value goods. Nobody expecting a computer, want a box full of stones.<p>What we are releasing: a custom Layer-1 blockchain stack.<p>Full Node: Implements Hybrid Consensus (PoW + PBFT) for instant finality.<p>Integrated Wallet: Native key management and transaction construction for the custom trade opcodes.<p>DB Management: Custom indexing for trade states and dispute evidence.<p>The system is currently in Alpha. I am looking for feedback on the protocol design, the node architecture and collaborators.<p>Code needs polishing, which i will do if people like the project. \nHowever, the project runs, and a testnet will be launched if people take interest in the project.<p>Readme files will be updated as well. Currently they provide a simple guide on how to build the project.<p>Feel free to send an email. It can be found my in profile or in the paper.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464133\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464133</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Show HN: I built a clipboard tool to strip/keep specific formatting like Italics",
      "content": "<p>Hello HN,<p>I\u2019m Joseph, a solo developer. I built CustomPaste because I was frustrated by the binary choice standard clipboard tools give us: either keep all the messy formatting (background colors, huge fonts) or strip everything down to plain text.<p>We all know Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text), but that is often too destructive, it kills hyperlinks, bolding, and lists when I usually just want to normalize the font family (e.g., force Arial 11pt) or remove background colors.<p>I wanted a tool that let me \"strip exactly what I want, and keep exactly what I want.\"<p>The Solution: Instead of a single \"paste\" behavior, the app lets you create reusable \"Recipes\" to define exactly how your text should land in your editor. It intercepts the clipboard, processes the structure locally, and transforms it based on your rules.<p>It offers granular control over:<p><pre><code>    Smart Preservation: You can strip or set specific font families and sizes but specifically preserve bold, italics, and hyperlinks.\n</code></pre>\nStructure: You can preserve tables while stripping the images inside them.<p>Data Cleanup: It can instantly purge duplicate lines, sort lists alphabetically, or flatten extra blank lines.<p>Text Fixes: It cleans up AI-generated artifacts (like \"smart quotes\" or em-dashes) and enforces casing (Title Case, Sentence Case).<p>Privacy & Pricing: The app runs 100% locally on your machine, no cloud processing and no data harvesting. It is a one-time purchase (lifetime license), not a subscription. There is a free trial (first 100 pastes) so you can test if it fits your workflow.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the \"Recipe\" approach or any other edge cases you struggle with when pasting text!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
