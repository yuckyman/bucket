The first pillar that we blogged about\npreviously is the development of <a href=\"https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2025/06/introducing-papercheck.html\"><i>P</i><i>apercheck</i></a>, a collection of software applications\nthat assess the transparency and methodological quality of research (DeBruine\n&amp; Lakens, 2025). Our approach is modular: for each defined aspect of transparency\nand methodological quality we develop a dedicated module and integrate it in\nthe <i>Papercheck </i>package. The module assesses the presence, the level of\ndetail and \u2013 if possible \u2013 the accuracy of information. Complete and accurate\ninformation for a large number of transparency indicators signals the\ntrustworthiness of a research report (Jamieson et al., 2019; Nosek et al., 2024).\nOn the dashboard a transparency indicator lights up in bright green when a research\nreport passed a specific check. An orange light indicates that some information\nis provided, but more detail is needed. <i>Papercheck</i> gives actionable feedback,\nsuggesting ways to provide more detailed information and correct inaccurate reporting.\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Respecting epistemic diversity</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">How do we decide for which indicators we\nwill develop a module that assesses research reports? Choosing these which\nindicators is not easy. This is where the second pillar comes in. It requires a\nseries of deliberative conversations with researchers from different\ndisciplines. In the social and behavioral sciences, there is much epistemic\ndiversity (Leonelli, 2022). Researchers working with different data and methods\nin different disciplines have very different ideas about what constitutes good\nresearch. They may even disagree which aspects of research should count in the\nevaluation of quality. We designed <i>Research Transparency Check</i> to\nrespect these differences. This means that we do not impose a set of good\npractices on researchers. We should not determine standards for good scientific\npractice. Instead, the trustworthiness of research should be evaluated with\nrespect to \u201cthe prevailing methodological standards in their field\u201d (De Ridder,\n2022, p.18). Therefore we start with a series of conversation between\nresearchers who all work with the same types of data. In the social and\nbehavioral sciences, we see researchers regularly use different types of data,\ncollected from seven different sources: from self-reports in surveys, from personal\ninterviews of individuals and (focus) groups, from observations by researchers\nof behavior through equipment, from participant observation by researchers, from\nofficial registers, news and social media, and from synthetic data. We expect that\nstructured conversations with researchers using the same category of data will produce\nconsensus about a core set of indicators that should be transparent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">The quality of surveys as an example</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Think about surveys for example. Surveys\nare a ubiquitous source of data in the social and behavioral sciences:\nresearchers in almost all disciplines use them. Regardless of their discipline,\nsurvey researchers have agreed for decades that it is important to know how the\nsample of participants was determined, what the researchers did to take\nselectivity in response rates and dropout into account, and how researchers\nmade sure that the reliability and validity of the survey questions posed to\nrespondents was high (Deming, 1944; Groves &amp; Lyberg, 2010). Without\ninformation about the sampling frame, the sampling method, the response rate, and\nthe reliability and validity of measures in the questionnaire, it is impossible\nto evaluate the quality of data from a survey. Still, a large proportion of\nresearch reports relying on surveys published in \u2018top journals\u2019 in the social\nsciences do not provide information on these transparency indicators\n(Stefkovics et al., 2024). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Despite consensus about these indicators,\nthere may still be differences in opinions about the importance of other indicators.\nPolitical scientists for instance tend to care a lot about weighting the data,\nfor instance with respect to voter registration, or voting behavior in the\nprevious election. Personality psychologists do not value weights as much,\nbecause there are e.g. no objective standards for the true distribution of\nintelligence or neuroticism in the population. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">When researchers agree on the importance of\na certain indicator, there may still be disciplinary specific standards of good\npractice. Researchers in different disciplines value different practices for\nthe same methodological quality indicator as good practices. For instance, standards\nfor the number of items to compose reliable measures in surveys vary between\ndisciplines. Surveys about intergenerational mobility in sociology typically\nask just one or a few question about educational attainment (Connelly et al.,\n2016); measuring implicit attitudes in social psychology requires dozens of repeated\nmeasures (Nosek et al., 2010). These differences may be understandable given\nthat researchers in different fields study different phenomena that are\ninherently more variable and more difficult to measure with high levels of\nprecision in some fields than in others. Another example is the norm for\np-values, which is .05 in most fields but much lower in others, such as 0.00000005\n(5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) in behavioral genetics (Benjamin et al., 2018). The point\nis that different fields set different standards for the same quality indicators,\neven when they are working with similar data sources. Thus, it is important to use\nfield-specific norms when evaluating the methodological quality of a study.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Toward reporting standards</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Transparency is a necessary condition to\nevaluate research quality (Vazire, 2017; Hardwicke &amp; Vazire, 2023):\n\u201ctransparency doesn\u2019t guarantee credibility, transparency and scrutiny together\nguarantee that research gets the credibility it deserves\u201d (Vazire, 2019). Only\nwhen research reports include information about indicators of methodological\nquality in sufficient detail and clear language, can the quality of the\nresearch be evaluated. In some fields, scholars, publishers, associations and\nfunders have come together to define reporting standards. Authors who wish to publish\na paper in a journal of the American Psychological Association are requested to\nconform to the APA Journal Article Reporting Standards. Funders and regulators\nin biomedicine impose reporting standards, for example CONSORT guidelines on the\nreporting of randomized control trials, or SPIRIT guidelines for their\nprotocols. Automated checks such as in <i>Papercheck</i> should not replace peer\nreview, but help relieve the burden on human reviewers to determine the degree\nof compliance with such reporting guidelines (Schulz et al., 2022). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In other fields, however, it\u2019s almost as if\nanything goes. In most areas of the social sciences, journals do not impose reporting\nstandards (Mali\u010dki, Aalbersberg, Bouter &amp; Ter Riet, 2019). They may have\nrules on the cosmetics of submitted journal articles, such as on language,\nstyle, and formatting of tables and figures, which editorial assistants enforce.\nBut the way sampling frames, sampling methods, response rates and information\nabout the reliability and validity of study measures are typically not subject\nto reporting standards. That should change, if we want a more reliable and\nvalid evaluation of research quality. It is also possible since journals can\nsimply mandate reporting standards (Mali\u010dki &amp; Mehmani, 2024).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The identification of transparency\nindicators and the collection of examples of good and poor practices in data\ncommunities will guide researchers in the social and behavioral sciences toward\nprecise and valid reporting standards. The field of biomedicine is ahead of the\nsocial sciences, with more than 675 reporting guidelines developed for very\nspecific study types (Equator Network, 2025). As we develop modules to automate\nchecks of methodological quality in research reports, we benefit from the experiences\nof toolmakers in biomedicine (Eckmann et al., 2025). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">A multidimensional measure of research\nquality</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">With multiple modules assessing the methodological\nquality of research reports for various transparency indicators, we obtain a\nmultidimensional and more refined measure of research quality. The modular\napproach helps solve a difficult problem in the Recognition and Rewards\nmovement: the lack of consensus about valid and reliable measurement of the\nquality of science. In the absence of such a measurement, universities have\nused \u201cone size fits all\u201d metrics of the volume and prestige of science publications.\n<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Universities incentivized researchers to\nproduce as many publications in peer reviewed journals as possible, generally\nregarding them as proxy measurements of \u2018high quality\u2019 science. Furthermore, the\nnumber of citations to the work of scholars became the standard measure of\nscholarly \u2018impact\u2019. Universities and science funders rewarded scholars who\npublished proficiently and were cited more frequently in international\npeer-reviewed journals by promoting them, giving them more research time, and\ngrants for research. Institutions ranked journals into tiers, and rewarded\nemployees more for publishing in \u2018top journals\u2019 than in \u2018B-journals\u2019.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As a result, these incentives reshaped scholarly\nbehavior. Scholars created networks of co-authors, each producing an article in\nturn, inviting colleagues to read along and pretend they helped produce the\npaper. In practice, the contributions were typically uneven, but the advantage\nwas large: the number of co-authors on publications increased (Henriksen, 2016;\nChapman et al., 2019), as did overall publication and citation counts. Scholars\nalso sought to publish in journals that on average receive higher numbers of\ncitations, so called \u2018high-impact journals\u2019. However, both journal rank and\ncitation counts are not correlated with higher methodological quality of\nresearch; in some cases the reverse is true, with worse science in the higher\nranked journals (Brembs, Button &amp; Munaf\u00f2, 2013; Dougherty &amp; Horne, 2022).\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Scholars behaved according to Campbell\u2019s\nLaw (Campbell, 1979): \u201cThe more any quantitative social indicator is used for\nsocial decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and\nthe more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is\nintended to monitor\u201d, with a result in line with Goodheart\u2019s Law (Goodheart,\n1975): \u201cwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\u201d (Varela,\nBenedetto, &amp; Sanchez-Santos, 2014). Over time, citations have become a less\ninformative indicator of research quality (Brembs, Button &amp; Munaf\u00f2, 2013;\nKoltun &amp; Hafner, 2021).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we\u2019ve learned from the hyper focus on peer\nreviewed journal articles is that one size doesn\u2019t fit all. It is not only\nmisguided to evaluate the quality of research by the number of articles\npublished or the number of citations and derivatives such as the H-index or the\njournal impact factor, it can lead to creation of perverse incentives and\nquestionable research practices (Higginson &amp; Munaf\u00f2, 2016; Smaldino &amp;\nMcElreath, 2016; Edwards &amp; Roy, 2017). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Recognition and rewards for transparent\nand good science</span></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Once the perverse effects of these\nincentives became clear, the resistance against quantitative output driven\nrewards grew. More than 3,500 organizations including the Association of\nUniversities in the Netherlands (VSNU), the Netherlands Federation of\nUniversity Medical Centers (NFU), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific\nResearch (NWO), the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and\nDevelopment (ZonMW), and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(KNAW) signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2025),\npromising not to measure the performance with quantitative indicators. In the\neffort to recognize and reward good science rather than a high volume of\npublications in peer reviewed journals, universities around the world \u2013 and\nparticularly those in the Netherlands \u2013 have diversified the criteria for\ntenure and promotion guidelines, in line with the Agreement on Reforming\nResearch Assessment of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (COARA,\n2022). </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The problem that has remained unsolved is\nthe measurement of research quality. In due course, <i>Research Transparency\nCheck</i> may help to address this problem. For transparency indicators that\ndata communities agree upon as relevant, we will have an automated screening\ntool, that provides good examples for best practices. Because the assessments\ncan be updated with every revision, institutions can not only measure the eventual\nquality of a publication, but also the quality of an initial preprint, and the change\nfrom the first draft to the published version. The added value of going through\npeer review can also be measured, incentivizing journals to provide better\nvalue for money. Journals could use <i>Papercheck </i>to ensure that authors adhere\nto journal reporting guidelines. On their end, authors can use <i>Papercheck </i>before\nthey submit their manuscript to ensure that it passes. At the same time, they\nare directed to the best practices in their field.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">References</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Bekkers, R., Lakens, D., DeBruine, L., Mesquida\nCaldenty, C. &amp; Littel, M.

      "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
      "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
      "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",
