      "title": "A Functional Resting-State Network Atlas Based on 420 Older Adults with Hypertension",
      "content": "The Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease (rrAD) trial included 513 cognitively normal, sedentary, hypertensive older adults (aged 60 to 85 years) with dementia risk factors. We utilized 420 high-quality baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans from this cohort to develop a functional atlas tailored for aging populations. Typical rs-fMRI atlases derived from healthy young adults do not account for age-related changes, such as cortical atrophy, enlarged ventricles, and altered connectivity. To address this gap, we created a cohort-specific MNI-adjacent anatomical template, rrAD420, using SPM12's DARTEL registration. In this space, we derived a comprehensive functional atlas using both group independent component analysis (GICA) and probabilistic functional mode decomposition (PROFUMO). The rrAD420 atlas offers detailed representations of Resting-State Network (RSN) connectivity, encompassing unique configurations and overlapping interactions. It features two Default-Mode Network (DMN)-specific seed-based maps (DMN24 with cerebellum, DMN18 without) and data-driven components resembling the major RSNs. Furthermore, PROFUMO allowed for the identification of multimodal and combinatory networks, capturing connections within and between RSNs. While optimized for hypertensive older adults, the rrAD420 atlas serves as a versatile tool for broader aging populations, aiding in the study of neurodegenerative processes and biomarker discovery.",

      "title": "GPR34 regulation of disease-associated microglial states and responses to physiological stimuli",
      "content": "GPR34 is a microglia-enriched GPCR whose expression is downregulated under several disease conditions, including Alzheimers disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite this, its function is poorly understood in normal or disease conditions, as is its contribution to disease-related microglia states. Using RNA-sequencing, we find that microglia from global Gpr34 knockout (KO) mouse brains exhibited transcriptional shifts toward disease-associated microglia (DAM) and inflammatory profiles, partially mirroring the microglial phenotype seen in 5xFAD AD model mice. Notably, when Gpr34 KO mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice, DAM transcriptional profiles and glial pathology were further exacerbated despite the already robust DAM signature driven by amyloidosis. This occurred without affecting amyloid plaque burden. In human stem cell-derived microglia (iMGLs), GPR34 KO strongly reduced calcium and phosphorylated ERK signaling in response to known GPR34 agonists, including lyso-phosphatidylserine (lysoPS) and myelin, and caused transcriptional alterations linked to immune regulation and cell proliferation. Interestingly, GPR34 loss selectively impaired phagocytosis of myelin but not amyloid-beta; or E. coli. Furthermore, GRP34 KO diminished, but did not abolish, the transcriptional response elicited by myelin. Together, these findings suggest that GPR34 is important for maintaining microglia homeostasis, mediating phagocytosis of and transcriptional response to myelin, and restraining microglial response to neurodegenerative disease conditions.",

      "title": "The Hidden Benefits of Noise: Low-Frequency tRNS and Dynamic Visual Noise Enhance Visual Processing",
      "content": "<p>Sensory and perceptual processing are inherently shaped by both internal and external noise sources. While noise is typically seen as disruptive, it can, under certain conditions, enhance the detection of weak sensory signals&mdash;a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). Research on SR has primarily focused on dissimilar noise sources such as static visual noise or high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS), leaving it unclear whether different noise types produce similar enhancements or operate through shared mechanisms. Here, we investigated how three external noise sources&mdash;hf-tRNS, low-frequency tRNS (lf-tRNS), and dynamic visual noise (DVN)&mdash;affect visual contrast detection, adopting an individualized analytical approach to account for variability in internal noise across participants. DVN was specifically designed to mirror the spatiotemporal characteristics of tRNS, enabling systematic evaluation of cortical- and sensory-level noise within a unified framework. Across three experiments (<i>n</i> = 149 of either sex), all noise types improved detection performance at participant-specific optimal intensities, with the most pronounced effects observed for subthreshold stimuli and in participants with lower baseline sensitivity, consistent with a compensatory role of external noise when perceptual encoding is weak. Notably, these results provide the first evidence of SR-like benefits from lf-tRNS, challenging frequency-dependent assumptions about the efficacy of electrical noise stimulation. Comparable enhancements with DVN further establish it as a promising noninvasive tool for perceptual modulation. Together, these findings expand the SR framework by demonstrating that both electrical and sensory noise can facilitate vision and highlight the importance of individualized approaches in neuromodulation and sensory enhancement.</p>",

      "title": "Selective Attention Shapes Neural Representations of Complex Auditory Scenes: The Roles of Object Identity and Scene Composition",
      "content": "<p>Everyday auditory scenes contain overlapping sound objects, requiring attention to isolate relevant objects from irrelevant background objects. This study examined how selective attention shapes neural representations of complex sound scenes in the auditory cortex (AC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activity from participants (12 males, 8 females) as they attended to a designated object in scenes comprising three overlapping sounds. Scenes were constructed in two manners: one where each object belonged to a different category (speech, animal, instrument) and another where all objects were from the same category. Attending to speech enhanced activations in lateral AC subfields, while attention to animal and instrument sounds preferentially modulated medial AC subfields, supporting models where attention modulates feature-selective neural gain in AC. Remarkably, however, spatial pattern analysis revealed that the attended object dominated the AC activation patterns of the entire scene in a manner depending on both object type and scene composition: When scene objects belonged to different categories, attention effects were dominated by category-level processing. In contrast, when all scene objects shared the same category, dominance shifted to exemplar-level processing in fields processing acoustic features. Thus, attention seems to dynamically prioritize the features offering maximal contrast within a given context, emphasizing object-specific patterns in feature-similar scenes and category-level patterns in feature-diverse scenes. Our results support models where top-down signals not only modulate gain but also affect scene decomposition and analysis&mdash;influencing stream segregation and gating of higher-level processing in a contextual manner, adapting to specific auditory environments.</p>",

      "title": "Trigeminal Motor Nucleus Regulates Microstructure of Feeding Behavior without Affecting Total Food Intake",
      "content": "<p>Feeding is critical for animal survival and is tightly regulated by designated neural circuits. Several brain regions have been implicated in feeding regulation, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, parabrachial nucleus, and others. However, how these feeding regulation neurons communicate with the executors of feeding behavior, the trigeminal motor (MoV) neurons that directly control mastication muscles, is unclear. Despite its clear involvement in feeding, MoV is rarely considered as a part of the feeding neural network in literature reviews, indicating an incomplete conceptual framework of feeding regulation. Here, by using Isl1 and ChAT as neuronal markers, we genetically targeted MoV neurons to reveal its connections with other brain regions and investigated their function in feeding in mice of either sex. Notably, we identified direct connection of MoV neurons with forebrain regions including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, while hypothalamic feeding regulation neurons do not represent as a major direct regulator of MoV neurons. Functionally, although complete silencing of MoV neurons renders the mice incapable of eating, acute inhibition or activation of MoV neurons only changed microstructure of feeding behavior without influencing total food intake, suggesting that MoV neurons mainly function as the executor of feeding but are not involved in appetite regulation. Moreover, activating the GABAergic input neurons of MoV neurons generated similar effect as activating the MoV neurons, because MoV neurons are depolarized by GABA transmission. Together, we established the role of MoV neurons in feeding regulation and advanced the understanding of hindbrain feeding regulation network.</p>",

      "title": "Improved Estimation of Correlation Accuracy for Machine Learning Brain-Phenotype Associations",
      "content": "Machine learning is used in neuroscience to examine brain-phenotype associations and facilitate individual prediction from high-dimensional brain imaging. For continuous phenotypes, Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted phenotype is used to quantify model accuracy in testing data. However, recent research suggests millions of samples may be needed to reliably estimate the maximum achievable predictive accuracy (MAPA). We formally define the MAPA and show that the Pearson estimator is biased for this quantity and its confidence intervals fail to capture the target. We develop a semiparametric (double machine learning) one-step estimator that more accurately estimates the MAPA and yields valid confidence intervals across flexible machine learning settings. Analyzing data from the Reproducible Brain Charts dataset, we show that this estimator has smaller bias when estimating brain-phenotype associations of neuroimaging data with age and psychopathology phenotypes. We show that MAPA for psychopathology factor scores using machine learning models built on structural and functional imaging measures is not better than using demographic and nuisance covariates alone.",

      "title": "ACSS2 mediates prenatal alcohol exposure-related morphological and behavioral phenotypes",
      "content": "The metabolic enzyme Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 (ACSS2) recently emerged as an unexpected regulator of molecular and behavioral changes associated with alcohol use. Its role during prenatal exposure, however, remains unknown. Here, we use a combination of proteomic, genomic and behavioral approaches to establish ACSS2 as a key mediator of prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes. We define the developmental window during which ACSS2 translocates to nuclei in the mouse brain, and show that alcohol-derived acetate is incorporated into fetal brain histone acetylation in utero. Using genetically engineered mice not expressing ACSS2, we demonstrate that loss of this enzyme attenuates chronic prenatal alcohol exposure-induced craniofacial abnormalities, motor function deficits, cognitive impairments as well as associated chromatin and gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus and the cerebellar vermis. Our results outline a previously unknown mechanism underlying prenatal alcohol exposure-related phenotypes regulated by ACSS2, which will inform the development of future therapeutic interventions.",
