      "title": "A systematic review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation",
      "content": "Precision in assessing neurological function after stroke is key to optimizing the efficacy of rehabilitation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a highly ecologically valid assessment of cortical activation and functional reorganization after stroke by monitoring cortical hemodynamic changes during different tasks. However, the current fNIRS task paradigm lacks systematic integration for standardized design and clinical translation strategies, and fragmented evidence is difficult to converge into actionable practice guidelines. To fill this gap, this paper systematically reviews the application of fNIRS in motor, cognitive, language, and dual-task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation research. It reveals the clinical value of different paradigms for neurological function assessment and proposes adaptive task designs that fit the functional characteristics of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of personalized and ecological paradigms, providing a theoretical basis and practical reference for subsequent standardized research on fNIRS task paradigms and developing clinical application standards.",

      "title": "Predictive coding in psychopathology: mechanistic model or metaphorical re-description?",
      "content": "Predictive coding (PC) has become a central framework in contemporary cognitive neuroscience, proposing that the brain operates as a hierarchical inference system that continuously minimizes the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory input. Its extension into clinical neuroscience has been accompanied by considerable enthusiasm, yet attempts to translate its computational principles into explanations of psychiatric and neurological disorders have yielded uneven results. The present review critically examines the clinical applicability of PC across three diagnostic domains: schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and mood and anxiety disorders. Drawing on findings from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling, the discussion evaluates how disturbances in prediction error signaling, the precision weighting of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs, and hierarchical inference have been proposed to relate to core clinical phenomena such as hallucinations, sensory hypersensitivity, and affective dysregulation. Particular attention is given to persistent theoretical tensions, including debates surrounding prior precision, the mapping between neural proxies and behavior, and the inconsistent use of PC terminology across diagnostic contexts. By adopting a structured and comparative approach, this review aims to clarify where predictive coding offers testable mechanistic insight into psychopathology, and where its explanatory scope remains limited or provisional.",

The patient\u2019s clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, treatment course, and outcomes were summarized alongside a comprehensive literature review.ResultsThe patient underwent resection of bilateral frontal lobe cysts followed later by resection of a parietal lobe cyst. Postoperative pathology confirmed LCC with calcification and cystic changes. No severe postoperative complications occurred. Follow-up imaging demonstrated gradual cyst regression and symptom resolution. Genetic testing identified heterozygous SNORD118 variants (n.3C>T and n.74G>A).ConclusionSurgical resection is an effective treatment for LCC cysts causing significant mass effect or neurological deficits, requiring regular follow-up. For smaller, asymptomatic cysts without mass effect, treatment with VEGF inhibitors (e.g., bevacizumab) may be beneficial. Management should be individualized.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo examine prefrontal hemodynamic changes in patients with post-stroke anxiety (PSA), both at rest and during cognitive task engagement, with the aim of elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of PSA and identifying potential neural correlates for clinical application.MethodsFifty patients with PSA and 45 post-stroke patients without anxiety symptoms were recruited. PSA was diagnosed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA \u2265 7), and comorbid depression was screened using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17 \u2265 8). Patients with significant cognitive impairment were excluded. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure resting-state functional connectivity in the frontopolar cortex (FPC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as well as task-evoked activation during the verbal fluency task (VFT). Demographic and clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between groups except for stroke type. Between-group comparisons were conducted to identify PSA-related differences in prefrontal network characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the influence of comorbid depression on neural alterations.ResultsThere were no significant differences between the PSA and non-PSA groups in demographic or clinical characteristics, including age, sex, and disease duration (P > 0.05). Compared to the non-PSA group, patients with PSA exhibited significantly reduced activation in the bilateral FPC during the VFT (P < 0.05). Within the PSA group, those with comorbid depression showed further reductions in activation in the bilateral FPC and the left DLPFC (P < 0.05). No significant differences in resting-state functional connectivity were observed between groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionReduced activation in the bilateral FPC may represent a key neural substrate associated with post-stroke anxiety. In addition, altered activation patterns in the bilateral FPC and left DLPFC may reflect neural correlates related to depressive symptoms in patients with PSA, providing candidate targets for future mechanistic and clinical studies.",

      "title": "Association between post-traumatic stress disorder levels and serum inflammatory factors in patients undergoing digit replantation",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the levels of early postoperative post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their association with serum inflammatory factors in patients undergoing digit replantation, and to analyze the influencing factors.MethodsA total of 96 patients who underwent digit replantation at Rizhao People\u2019s Hospital between March 2022 and December 2024 were enrolled 7\u202fdays postoperatively. PTSD levels were assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Morning fasting blood samples were collected, and serum levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis, Spearman\u2019s correlation, multiple linear regression, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsThe mean PCL-C score for the 96 patients was 38.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.31, with 44 patients (45.83%) presenting PTSD symptoms. Univariate analysis revealed that gender, education level, injury type, complete amputation, involvement of the dominant hand, and number of amputated digits significantly influenced PCL-C scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). PCL-C scores showed positive correlations with both anxiety and depression scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.285 and 0.679, respectively, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Multiple linear regression identified gender, education level, complete amputation, number of injured digits, and levels of anxiety and depression as independent influencing factors for PTSD (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that PCL-C scores were positively correlated with IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels (r\u202f=\u202f0.581, 0.521, 0.552, and 0.507, respectively), and negatively correlated with IL-10 (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.474, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). ROC curve analysis suggested that serum inflammatory factors have good predictive value for PTSD.ConclusionPatients exhibit a certain degree of PTSD in the early stage after digit replantation. Its occurrence is closely associated with female gender, lower education level, severity of the trauma, and co-morbid anxiety and depression, and is significantly correlated with an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory serum factors. Serum inflammatory factors may serve as potential biological markers for the early identification of PTSD risk.",

      "title": "Electrical stimulation in upper limb assistance: opportunities and challenges",
      "content": "The global rise in non-communicable diseases, alongside an aging population, is expected to increase the prevalence of motor impairments and, therefore, the need for assistive care. Upper limb impairments can significantly affect independent living and increase long-term care costs. Wearable assistive devices incorporating electrical stimulation (ES) offer a promising solution to support independence and help alleviate pressures on both formal and informal care provision. The development of hybrid systems, which integrate aspects of robotics and electrical stimulation, aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-modality devices. However, there is limited information on the most appropriate electrical stimulation protocols to use, or on what challenges may be faced in doing so. Correspondingly, this narrative review addresses this gap through assessing the role of electrical stimulation in upper limb assistive technology. By evaluating user requirements and identifying challenges with current stimulation strategies, this review highlights the potential benefits of exploring alternative protocols, beyond conventional functional electrical stimulation (FES) techniques, for upper limb assistance. In particular, addressing practical difficulties of stimulation is likely to be critical for successful user uptake and minimizing device abandonment. The paper subsequently reviews several stimulation strategies which may offer novel research directions and opportunities in the development of upper limb assistive technologies.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Developer Interaction Patterns with Proactive AI: A Five-Day Field Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.",
