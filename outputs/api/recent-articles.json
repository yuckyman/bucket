      "title": "Eye-tracking during free visual exploration of familiar dramatic character faces facilitates rapid and accurate stroke recognition",
      "content": "BackgroundStroke patients often experience significant impairments, making rapid and accurate detection crucial for timely intervention and early warning. However, existing diagnostic methods such as advanced neuroimaging are often time-consuming, highly dependent on operator expertise, or costly and complex to deploy, limiting their scalability in resource-restricted settings. Eye movement patterns in stroke patients present a promising opportunity for efficient detection, given their close ties to underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and potential diagnostic sensitivity. Nevertheless, the lack of a feasible task paradigm and robust detection strategy has hindered the practical application of eye movement-based stroke identification. This study aimed to capture eye movement dysfunction associated with stroke through an ecological paradigm and develop a machine learning model with improved diagnostic accuracy.MethodsWe recorded eye movement signals in stroke patients (N = 16) and healthy controls (N = 23) during free visual exploration of familiar dramatic character faces. A diverse set of eye movement features, encompassing saccadic, fixation, and scanpath features, was extracted and analyzed. These features were subsequently employed to construct machine learning models for the recognition of stroke patients.ResultsWe identified distinctive eye movement patterns in the stroke group, including prolonged fixation duration, restricted saccadic movements, and reduced scanpath length, which reflect underlying visual processing impairments. Furthermore, by integrating these multi-dimensional eye movement features, our machine learning model achieved a high accuracy of 87.18% and an excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 in distinguishing stroke patients.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that ecologically valid eye-tracking, combined with multi-type feature analytics, serves as a practical screening tool with the potential to significantly improve identification accuracy and alleviate logistical burdens in community and primary care settings.",

      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Kai Wang, one of the creators of Yuanzai World.<p>We built a simulation engine (currently on iOS & Android) that allows the community to create and share text adventures populated by multiple LLM-based agents. Unlike standard chatbots, our focus is on community co-creation\u2014users define the worldviews, and our agents (with persistent memory and social relationships) bring them to life.<p>The cool part:<p>We implemented a system we call \"World-Line Divergence\" (inspired by visual novels like Steins;Gate). Usually, AI RPGs feel random or infinite loop. We built a state machine that tracks \"World Deviation.\" If players interact with NPCs in specific ways (e.g., convincing an artist to change their style), it triggers a graph switch, leading to a completely different generated ending, effectively breaking the original script.<p>Tech Stack:<p>- Backend: Python / Java with a custom AI orchestration framework (to handle agent concurrency).<p>- Models: Hybrid routing between Gemini, GPT, and DeepSeek (optimizing for cost/performance based on task).<p>- Vector DB: Milvus (for handling long-term agent memory).<p>We are currently live on App Store and Google Play. Since it's a mobile-first experience, the link leads to our landing page where you can see the demo flow.<p>Would love to hear your feedback on the \"World-Line\" concept: Does this state-machine approach solve the aimlessness of AI RPGs?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
