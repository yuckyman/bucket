      "title": "A GPCR signaling pathway in insect odor detection",
      "content": "Odor detection differs fundamentally in vertebrates, which use G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and insects, which employ ion channels. Here, we report the first evidence for a GPCR defining tuning properties of insect olfactory sensory neurons. Single-cell transcriptomics of the Drosophila melanogaster antenna identified selective expression of the G{gamma}30A subunit in acid-sensing Ir64a-DC4 neurons. G{gamma}30A is essential for broadening responses to long-chain acids, acting with Gs, G{beta}13F, adenylate cyclase Ac13E and the Cngl channel. We further discovered that Cirl, a latrophilin-family GPCR, is broadly-transcribed in the antenna but the protein is localized only in Ir64a-DC4 sensory cilia, dependent upon G{gamma}30A, but not Ir64a. Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components. Our findings reveal unexpected roles for GPCR/metabotropic signaling in olfactory detection and divergence in insects.",

      "title": "Developmental Dysregulation of Synaptic and Myelin-Related Genes in Frontal Cortex and Serum Infrared Spectroscopy Signature in the Valproic Acid Model of Autism",
      "content": "Neural circuits emerge during development through dynamic interactions between genetic instructions and environmental cues that shape cell fate, connectivity, and the timing of myelination. In developmental disorders such as autism, abnormalities in sensory processing, social cognition, and motor behavior are thought to arise from disruptions in these processes. Here, we investigated early-life molecular changes following prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an environmentally induced model of autism. We integrated cortical gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing/qPCR, alternative splicing profiling, in situ myelin quantification, plasma serotonin determination, and machine learning-assisted classification of blood serum molecular profiles using infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) data. Our findings revealed downregulation of myelin-associated genes and upregulation of synapse-related genes in the frontal cortex of young VPA-exposed rats. qPCR confirmed reduced cortical expression of Mobp and PLP1 along with increased Penk and C1ql3 expression. Alternative splicing analysis identified numerous novel transcript variants, enriched in synaptic-related genes, indicating widespread post-transcriptional remodeling in VPA animals. These molecular alterations were accompanied by a significant reduction in myelin content within the cingulate and motor cortex of adult animals. Peripheral molecular profiling showed elevated plasma serotonin in VPA-treated animals and demonstrated that a support vector machine trained on serum FTIR spectra classified VPA-exposed animals with 85% accuracy. Collectively, our findings suggest that prenatal VPA exposure induces early dysregulation of myelin organization, synaptic gene networks, and RNA splicing programs, potentially leading to long-term impairments in neuronal communication and processing efficiency. Furthermore, our results highlight serum spectroscopic signatures as promising peripheral biomarkers for autism, warranting further investigation.",

      "title": "TMS-EEG reveals causal dynamics of the premotor cortex during musical improvisation",
      "content": "Musical improvisation illustrates the brain's capacity for flexible, creative motor control, yet the causal mechanisms underlying this complex behaviour remain poorly understood. We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe state-dependent cortical dynamics in the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of professional jazz pianists (n = 3) during improvisation, sight-reading, and rest. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of combining perturbational neuroscience with ecologically valid musical performance. Multiple convergent analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures during improvisation: reduced local mean field power, decreased phase-locking of evoked responses, and preserved but gain-modulated early components as revealed by Correlated Components Analysis. These findings suggest that improvisation is characterized by attenuated PMd excitability and more variable response timings, while preserving the fundamental architecture of cortical responses. This perturbational signature supports a neural efficiency model of expertise whereby expert musicians achieve creative flexibility through training-induced streamlined, optimized cortical processing. Our results establish TMS-EEG as a powerful approach for investigating the causal dynamics of creative cognition and demonstrate how the brain reconfigures its response properties to support internally driven motor performance.",

      "title": "Neuroinflammatory Stress Preferentially Impacts Synaptic MAPK Signaling and Mitochondria in Excitatory Neurons",
      "content": "Background: Understanding synapse-specific effects of neuroinflammation can provide mechanistic and therapeutically relevant insights across the spectrum of neurological diseases. Methods: We applied neuron-specific proteomic biotinylation in vivo, differential centrifugation of brain for crude synaptosome enrichment (P2 fraction) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of biotinylated proteins to derive native-state proteomes of Camk2a-positive neurons and their corresponding P2 synaptic compartments. Next, in an in vivo model of systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dosing, we examined the effects of neuroinflammation on whole neuron and synaptic compartments using a combination of MS, network analysis, confirmatory biochemical and ultrastructural assays and integrative approaches across our mouse-derived and existing human datasets. Results: Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses of P2 fractions verified enrichment in synaptic elements, including synaptic vesicles and mitochondria. MS of biotinylated proteins from Camk2a-specific bulk brain homogenates (whole neuron) and P2 fractions (synaptosome) showed enrichment of >1000 proteins, consistent with neuron-specific biotinylation, also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Camk2a-specific synaptic proteome revealed molecular signatures related to mitochondrial function, synaptic transmission, protein translation. LPS-treated mice displayed body weight loss and neuroinflammation, characterized by glial activation, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and upregulated expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related microglial genes. LPS-induced neuroinflammation exerted distinct effects on the synaptic proteome, including increased mitochondrial and reduced cytoskeletal-synaptic proteins, while suppressed synaptic MAPK signaling. Importantly, these changes were not observed at the whole neuron level, indicating unique vulnerability of the synapse to neuroinflammation. In line with synapse proteomic and signaling changes, LPS altered the ultrastructure of asymmetric synapses, suggesting dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission. Co-expression network analysis of Camk2a neuronal proteins further resolved mitochondria- and synapse-specific protein modules, some of which were neuroinflammation-dependent. Neuroinflammation increased levels of a mitochondria-enriched module, and decreased levels of a pre-synaptic vesicle module, without impacting a post-synaptic membrane module. LPS-dependent mitochondrial and LPS-independent post-synaptic modules in mouse neurons mapped to post-mortem human AD brain proteomic modules which were decreased in cases with AD dementia and positively correlated to cognitive function, including pro-resilience markers for AD. Conclusion: Our findings using native-state proteomics of Camk2a neurons combined with synaptosome enrichment identify proteome-level mechanisms of early synaptic vulnerability to neuroinflammation relevant to AD.",

      "title": "Multi-stable oscillations in cortical networks with two classes of inhibition",
      "content": "In the classic view of cortical rhythms, the interaction between excitatory pyramidal neurons (E) and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons (I) has been shown to be sufficient to generate gamma and beta band rhythms. However, it is now clear that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.",

      "title": "Comparative transcriptomics reveals shifts in cortical architecture at themetatherian/eutherian transition",
      "content": "The neocortex, a layered structure unique to mammals, supports higher-order functions such as perception, learning, and decision-making. While its overall organization is broadly conserved, it remains unclear whether changes to the cell type-specific organization of the cortical column--the basic unit of cortical processing--occurred at the metatherian/eutherian split. To address this, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to compare gene expression, cell types, and laminar architecture in the primary visual cortex of a metatherian (Monodelphis domestica) and a eutherian mammal (Mus musculus). We find distinctions between supragranular (layer 2/3) and infragranular (layers 5 and 6) intratelencephalic (IT) neurons to be more pronounced in mice, with layer 2/3 neurons enriched for transcripts involved in synaptic transmission, adhesion, and dendritic development. Mouse cortex also exhibits expanded populations of disinhibitory interneurons, redistribution of perineuronal nets, and reduced oligodendrocyte density--features known to enhance cortical plasticity. These findings suggest the metatherian/eutherian split was accompanied by remodeling of the cortical column, highlighting potential substrates of neocortical evolution in early mammals.",

      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

      "content": "ObjectivesNight-shift work is associated with cognitive impairments, but convenient, effective, and acceptable traditional Chinese medicine-based interventions remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure combined with auricular acupoint massage on cognitive function in night-shift nurses, using P300 wave parameters from electroencephalography analysis as objective metrics.MethodsEighty nurses (40 days-shift, 40 night-shift) participated. The intervention included auricular acupressure and massage targeting six points, performed daily for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). P300 amplitude and latency were measured.ResultsNight-shift nurses had significantly higher ISI scores and lower MoCA attention, memory, and total scores compared to day-shift nurses (all p < 0.05). Before the intervention, After FDR correction for multiple comparisons, P300 amplitude was significantly lower at the T4 electrode site (q = 0.020) in the night-shift group. P300 latency remained significantly prolonged at sites Fz (q = 0.020), F3 (q < 0.001), F4 (q = 0.035), and T5 (q = 0.033). Post-intervention, the night-shift group demonstrated significant increases in P300 amplitude at F3, F4, T3, T4, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05) and significant reductions in P300 latency at Fz, F4, F7, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05). Notably, several sites with affected P300 amplitude and latency before the intervention showed significant improvement following intervention.ConclusionAuricular acupressure and massage significantly improved cognitive function in night-shift nurses, evidenced by enhanced P300 parameters. This non-invasive, cost-effective intervention shows promise for alleviating cognitive impairments from shift work.",

      "content": "BackgroundSleep disorders are prevalent, affecting 27% of the population and linked to health issues like cognitive impairments and cardiovascular diseases. Current treatments have limitations, prompting interest in sensory stimulation therapy as an alternative approach.ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to explore the effectiveness of sensory stimulation therapy as an intervention for improving sleep disorders, as well as its range of applicability, by synthesizing existing research.MethodsUsing the methodological framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and following the PRISMA guidelines, both keywords and free-text searches were conducted. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were then selected from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wanfang Knowledge Service Platform Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. Each article was screened and analyzed according to specific research elements.ResultsA total of 20 randomized controlled trials, involving 1489 participants across 2 types of sensory stimulation therapy, namely multi-sensory and single-sensory stimulations, were included in the study. The main sensory stimuli applied were auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile, while the intervention methods included music therapy, light therapy, aromatherapy and massage therapy. The intervention duration, frequency and cycles varied considerably, but most studies implementing individual sessions lasting 20\u201360 min, at least three sessions per week. Fourteen methods were used to assess sleep quality, and the majority of studies applied two or more assessment methods. Completion rates were also high, with 85%\u2013100% of patients completing over 80% of the intervention protocol. Interestingly, 19 studies reported no adverse events. Overall, sensory stimulation therapy had a positive impact on sleep quality, particularly in aspects such as sleep latency, total sleep time, and subjective sleep experience.ConclusionThe results indicated that sensory stimulation therapy is a safe, feasible and beneficial intervention for improving sleep quality in patients with sleep disorders. However, several limitations were identified in the included studies. Future large-sample, multi-center, high-quality RCTs are needed to further verify the efficacy of this therapy, and provide stronger evidence for their clinical application.Systematic review registrationhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ2XT",
