      "title": "Hypothesis Testing Governs an Efficiency-Flexibility Trade-off in Strategic Motor Learning",
      "content": "It remains unknown how people discover an effective movement strategy when the environment changes (e.g., when adapting to a new computer trackpad). We propose that strategic adaptation operates through hypothesis testing: learners generate candidate hypotheses, discard those inconsistent with feedback, and iteratively refine their actions through practice. A core prediction of this account is an efficiency-flexibility trade-off. In constrained environments, where few hypotheses are viable, learning slows as people eliminate competing hypotheses but supports broader generalization. In unconstrained environments, where many hypotheses are viable, learning accelerates as learners adopt one of many expedient hypotheses but yields poorer generalization. In two reaching experiments (N = 560), we varied the arrangement of target positions to manipulate how tightly the hypothesis space was constrained. As predicted, the constrained group learned more slowly but generalized more - an efficiency-flexibility trade-off that highlights hypothesis testing as a novel process governing human motor learning.",

      "title": "MOSAIC: A scalable framework for fMRI dataset aggregation and modeling of human vision",
      "content": "Recent large-scale vision fMRI datasets have been invaluable resources to the vision neuroscience community for their deep sampling of individual subjects and diverse stimulus sets. However, practical limitations to the number of subjects, stimuli, and trials that can be collected prevent individual fMRI datasets from reaching the scale necessary for modern modeling approaches and robust conclusions. Here, we introduce MOSAIC (Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling), a fMRI dataset aggregation framework designed to leverage the richness of individual datasets for computationally intensive modeling and robust tests of generalization. MOSAIC is composed of eight large-scale vision fMRI datasets totaling 93 subjects, 430,007 fMRI-stimulus pairs, and 162,839 naturalistic and artificial stimuli. A shared fMRI preprocessing pipeline and a filtered test-train split minimizes dataset-specific confounds and test-set leakage when aggregating the datasets. Crucially, additional datasets can be integrated into MOSAIC post hoc, allowing MOSAIC to evolve according to the community's interests. We use MOSAIC to show that perceptually diverse stimulus sets consistently improve decoding accuracy and stability, carrying implications for future fMRI stimulus set design. We then jointly train brain-optimized encoding models across subjects and datasets to predict fMRI activity of all visual cortex and even the whole brain. In silico functional localizer experiments performed on these digital twin models can recover subject-specific category-selective cortical regions, thereby validating our approach. Together, MOSAIC provides a scalable and community-driven solution to build robust, larger-scale models of human vision.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",
