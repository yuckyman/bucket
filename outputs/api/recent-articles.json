We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

      "content": "Road traffic accidents remain a leading cause of fatalities worldwide, and the consequences are considerably worsened by delayed detection and emergency response. Although several machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, accident detection systems are not widely deployed, and most existing solutions fail to handle the growing complexity of modern traffic environments. This study introduces Collaborative Intelligence for Road Safety (CIRS), a novel, multi-agent,...",

      "title": "Real-Time Object Classification via Dual-Pixel Measurement",
      "content": "Achieving rapid and accurate object classification holds significant importance in various domains. However, conventional vision-based techniques suffer from several limitations, including high data redundancy and strong dependence on image quality. In this work, we present a high-speed, image-free object classification method based on dual-pixel measurement and normalized central moment invariants. Leveraging the complementary modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD), the...",

Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden...",
