      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Will and Jorge, and we\u2019ve built LAD (Language-Aided Design), a SolidWorks add-in that uses LLMs to create sketches, features, assemblies, and macros from conversational inputs (<a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a>).<p>We come from software engineering backgrounds where tools like Claude Code and Cursor have come to dominate, but when poking around CAD systems a few months back we realized there's no way to go from a text prompt input to a modeling output in any of the major CAD systems. In our testing, the LLMs aren't as good at making 3D objects as they are are writing code, but we think they'll get a lot better in the upcoming months and years.<p>To bridge this gap, we've created LAD, an add-in in SolidWorks to turn conversational input and uploaded documents/images into parts, assemblies, and macros. It includes:<p>- Dozens of tools the LLM can call to create sketches, features, and other objects in parts.<p>- Assembly tools the LLM can call to turn parts into assemblies.<p>- File system tools the LLM can use to create, save, search, and read SolidWorks files and documentation.<p>- Macro writing/running tools plus a SolidWorks API documentation search so the LLM can use macros.<p>- Automatic screenshots and feature tree parsing to provide the LLM context on the current state.<p>- Checkpointing to roll back unwanted edits and permissioning to determine which commands wait for user permission.<p>You can try LAD at <a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a> and let us know what features would make it more useful for your work. We\u2019d love your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Impaired touch sensation on hairy skin in HCN3-deficient mice",
      "content": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel HCN3 is expressed in sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, but its contribution to somatosensory processing remains poorly understood. Here, using RNA in situ hybridization, we found that Hcn3 is widely expressed in various populations of DRG neurons. Analysis of HCN3-deficient mice in a series of behavioral tests for somatosensory function revealed that HCN3 deletion led to profound impairments in mechanical sensation on hairy skin. However, the mechanical sensation on glabrous skin and responses to noxious heat and cold stimuli were not affected in the absence of HCN3. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that deletion of HCN3 reduced the HCN current (Ih) density and affected the action potential kinetics in thoracic (Th9\u2013Th10) DRG neurons, which innervate hairy skin. However, electrophysiological parameters were unaltered in lumbar (L4\u2013L5) DRG neurons. These findings suggest that HCN3 channels are specific regulators of low-threshold mechanoreceptors that innervate hairy skin.",
