      "title": "Predictive nomogram for post-stroke motor dysfunction using fNIRS",
      "content": "BackgroundThere is a lack of objective evaluation tools for assessing upper limb motor dysfunction in ischemic stroke patients (ULMD-IS). This study aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic nomogram for diagnosing the severity of ULMD-IS using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data.MethodsThis retrospective analysis included 275 ULMD-IS patients at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to a training group (n = 193) or a validation group (n = 82). The data were preprocessed using HOMER2. In the training group, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify predictive variables and construct the nomogram. The nomogram\u2019s performance was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsNo significant differences in baseline characteristics, including sex, age, lesion hemisphere, or medical history, were observed between the training and validation groups. LASSO regression analysis identified three independent risk factors: deoxyhemoglobin (HbD) levels in the affected temporal region, total hemoglobin (HbT) levels in the total region, and HbT levels in the unaffected frontopolar region. These factors showed good differentiation ability (training group AUC: 0.766, verification group AUC: 0.861). The model\u2019s goodness-of-fit was confirmed, and it demonstrated a favorable net clinical benefit. Additionally, correlation analysis between these model variables and activities of daily living (ADL) scores revealed no significant relationships (p > 0.05 for all variables), indicating that the identified risk factors may not directly influence ADL performance.ConclusionThis study identified HbD in the affected temporal region, Total HbT levels, and HbT in the unaffected frontopolar region as independent risk factors for diagnosing the severity of ULMD-IS, and a corresponding predictive model was constructed. Given the model\u2019s limited sensitivity, the nomogram should be regarded only as a supplementary reference for objectively assessing post-stroke motor dysfunction; its utility in predicting treatment outcomes and guiding therapeutic choices remains modest and warrants cautious interpretation.",

      "content": "IntroductionSupplementary motor area (SMA) hyperactivity is thought to be a key neural mechanism in tics. This study probed SMA\u2019s role in tic expression, voluntary tic control, and premonitory urge experiences using one session of 1 Hz \u201cinhibitory\u201d repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting SMA in a repeated measures, small-N experimental design.MethodsYouth with Tourette Syndrome (TS) ages 12\u201417 years (N = 14) completed a clinical assessment and MRI to localize SMA. The video-based Tic Suppression Task (TST) quantified tic frequency and urges during conditions of Free-to-Tic, Suppression, and Suppression+Reward. The TST was followed by randomly assigned active 1 Hz (n = 8) or sham rTMS (n = 6) and TST repetition post-stimulation.ResultsActive rTMS led to greater tic frequency reductions during Free-to-Tic (d = 0.34) and Suppression+Reward (d = 0.24) but not Suppression (d = 0.0). A stronger effect size for active rTMS was observed in both suppression conditions (d = 0.26, d = 0.63) when excluding participants classified as baseline \u201cstrong suppressors\u201d (n = 5). Urges did not differ group-wise for Free-to-Tic (d = 0.09) but decreased more following active rTMS in both suppression conditions (d = 0.19, d = 0.52).DiscussionOverall, results suggest that the acute aftereffects of active 1 Hz rTMS to SMA may include reduced natural tic frequency, improved tic controllability, and lower urge intensity, especially while engaged in suppression efforts. Results are consistent with prior literature pointing to SMA hyperactivation in TS and suggests the potential therapeutic value of rTMS.",

      "title": "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy detects distinct TAR DNA-binding protein 43 signatures in frontotemporal lobar degeneration",
      "content": "BackgroundFrontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a leading cause of cognitive impairment in young adults. A major pathological subtype of FTLD is characterized by positive expression of TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43), referred to as FTLD[TDP]. However, techniques that can be utilized to interrogate and distinguish between various subtypes of FTLD are limited. Herein, we evaluated the potential of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to inform on the biomolecular changes in FTLD and to discriminate this disease from other non-FTLD cases.MethodsHistopathologically confirmed cases from FTLD[TDP] and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) autopsy cases were evaluated using FTIR spectroscopy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue sections from the superior and medial temporal lobes were obtained from a single control case, an AD case, an FTLD[TDP] case, and a comorbid FTLD[TDP] case that presented with AD pathology (tau and \u03b2-amyloid; FTLD[TDP]\u202f+\u202fAD). All samples were immunostained for pathological forms of tau, \u03b2-amyloid, and TDP-43. Myelin was assessed by proteolipid protein staining. Consecutive tissue sections were scanned by FTIR spectroscopy. Spectral maps were manually segmented, matching ten grey matter (GM) and ten white matter (WM) subregions per case for analysis. Peak-area ratios from lipid and amide functional groups as detected by FTIR spectroscopy were quantified and compared.ResultsRelative to the control tissue, both FTLD cases and AD showed increased ratios of amide I/II, \u03b1-helix/unordered proteins, \u03b1-helix/phosphorylated proteins, and olefinic/lipid content in GM and WM. The \u03b1-helix/unordered ratio was significantly different between FTLD cases and AD, while \u03b1-helix/unordered and \u03b1-helix/phosphorylated ratios differed significantly between FTLD[TDP] and FTLD[TDP]\u202f+\u202fAD. Across all cases and brain subregions, FTIR spectroscopy-derived amide I/II, olefinic/lipid, and carboxyl/lipid ratios significantly correlated positively with TDP-43 and tau immunoreactivity (p-value < 0.05).ConclusionFourier transform infrared spectroscopy of FFPE brain tissue sections from FTLD[TDP] and AD captures disease-specific changes in the composition of proteins, lipids, and secondary structures. These findings suggest that FTIR spectroscopy can serve as a rapid and cost-effective tool for mapping and quantitating biomolecular alterations in FTLD.",

Despite frailty\u2019s prevalence in older adults, there is limited research on its neural substrates.MethodsIn this study, we used connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to find a linear relationship between task-based connectomes taken from tasks that involved similar handgrip manipulations and a separate measure of physical frailty: the maximum grip strength in older adults.ResultsWe observed that the task-based connectomes were able to explain individual differences in grip strength, with the Subcortical and Cerebellum network, particularly the caudate nucleus functional connectivity, being the strongest predictor.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that task-based functional connectomes can serve as personalized markers for predicting individual behavioral measures, such as handgrip strength, and highlight the role of the caudate nucleus in physical frailty.",

      "content": "Background and objectiveCognitive impairment (CI, combing mild cognitive impairment and dementia) seriously affects the quality of life in patients with de novo Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to identify the potential predictive factors for 5-year cognitive decline in de novo PD.MethodsParkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) database was retrieved and PD patients with normal global cognition at baseline were included. These patients were divided into normal cognitive (NC) group and CI group based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores at the 5-year follow-up period. A total of 66 baseline variables were compared between these two groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted, followed by the development and validation of a nomogram to predict 5-year global cognitive decline in de novo PD patients.ResultsA total of 344 PD patients with normal baseline cognition were included, in which 73 individuals developed CI at the 5\u202fyear follow-up period. Baseline MoCA, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (BJOLO), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) immediate recall, Letter Number Sequencing (LNS), Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Semantic Fluency Test (SFT) scores, and Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson\u2019s disease for Autonomic symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) total, gastrointestinal, and sexual dysfunction scores were selected out from the 66 potential predictors based on logistic regression analysis. These predictors were finally included in the nomogram of the model. The area under the ROC curve of the model was 0.870 (95% CI, 0.825\u20130.915).ConclusionOur study constructed a model that predicts 5-year cognitive decline in de novo PD with high accuracy, which may allow for the early risk stratification of future CI in PD patients at baseline.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "Sleep Modulation: The Challenge of Transitioning from Open Loop to Closed Loop",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03784v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.",

      "title": "Head, posture, and full-body gestures in interactive communication",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When face-to-face communication becomes effortful due to background noise or interfering talkers, the role of visual cues becomes increasingly important for communication success. While previous research has selectively examined head or hand movements, here we explore movements of the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesized that increasing background noise in conversations would lead to increased gesture frequency in hand, head, trunk, and leg movements typical of conversation. Increased use of hand movements should support the speaker's role, while increased head and trunk movements may help the listener. We conducted a free dyadic conversation experiment with normal-hearing participants (n=8) in a virtual acoustic environment. Conversational movements were described with a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational actions, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed gesture quality by assessing hand-speech synchrony, with the hypothesis that higher levels of background noise would lead to a loss of synchrony according to an interactive coupling model. Higher noise levels led to increased hand-gesture complexity during speaking and listening, more pronounced up-down head movements, and contrary to expectations, head movements during listening generally decreased relative to speaking. Synchrony and peak velocity were unaffected by noise, while gesture quality scaled only modestly. The results support previous findings regarding gesturing frequency, but we found only limited evidence for changes in speech-gesture synchrony. This work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and illustrates multimodal adaptation to communication demands.",

      "title": "Synthetic Cognitive Walkthrough: Aligning Large Language Model Performance with Human Cognitive Walkthrough",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03568v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conducting usability testing like cognitive walkthrough (CW) can be costly. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), with visual reasoning and UI navigation capabilities, present opportunities to automate CW. We explored whether LLMs (GPT-4 and Gemini-2.5-pro) can simulate human behavior in CW by comparing their walkthroughs with human participants. While LLMs could navigate interfaces and provide reasonable rationales, their behavior differed from humans. LLM-prompted CW achieved higher task completion rates than humans and followed more optimal navigation paths, while identifying fewer potential failure points. However, follow-up studies demonstrated that with additional prompting, LLMs can predict human-identified failure points, aligning their performance with human participants. Our work highlights that while LLMs may not replicate human behaviors exactly, they can be leveraged for scaling usability walkthroughs and providing UI insights, offering a valuable complement to traditional usability testing.",

      "title": "Left shifting analysis of Human-Autonomous Team interactions to analyse risks of autonomy in high-stakes AI systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03519v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Developing high-stakes autonomous systems that include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components is complex; the consequences of errors can be catastrophic, yet it is challenging to plan for all operational cases. In stressful scenarios for the human operator, such as short decision-making timescales, the risk of failures is exacerbated. A lack of understanding of AI failure modes obstructs this and so blocks the robust implementation of applications of AI in smart systems. This prevents early risk identification, leading to increased time, risk and cost of projects.\n  A key tenet of Systems Engineering and acquisition engineering is centred around a \"left-shift\" in test and evaluation activities to earlier in the system lifecycle, to allow for \"accelerated delivery of [systems] that work\". We argue it is therefore essential that this shift includes the analysis of AI failure cases as part of the design stages of the system life cycle. Our proposed framework enables the early characterisation of risks emerging from human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in operational contexts. The cornerstone of this is a new analysis of AI failure modes, built on the seminal modelling of human-autonomy teams laid out by LaMonica et al., 2022. Using the analysis of the interactions between human and autonomous systems and exploring the failure modes within each aspect, our approach provides a way to systematically identify human-AI interactions risks across the operational domain of the system of interest. The understanding of the emergent behaviour enables increased robustness of the system, for which the analysis should be undertaken over the whole scope of its operational design domain. This approach is illustrated through an example use case for an AI assistant supporting a Command & Control (C2) System.",

      "title": "EMINDS: Understanding User Behavior Progression for Mental Health Exploration on Social Media",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03495v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mental health is an urgent societal issue, and social scientists are increasingly turning to online mental health communities (OMHCs) to analyze user behavior data for early intervention. However, existing sequence mining techniques fall short of the urgent need to explore the behavior progression of different groups (e.g., recovery or deterioration groups) and track the potential long-term impact of behaviors on mental health status. To address this issue, we introduce EMINDS, a visual analytics system built on a novel automatic mining pipeline that extracts distinct behavior stages and assesses the potential impact of frequent stage patterns on mental health status over time. The system includes a set of interactive visualizations that summarize the meaning of each behavior stage and the evolution of different stage patterns. We feature a pattern-centric Sankey diagram to reveal contextual information about the impact of stage patterns on mental health, helping experts understand the specific changes in sequences before and after a stage pattern. We evaluated the effectiveness and usability of EMINDS through two case studies and expert interviews, which examined the potential stage patterns impacting long-term mental health by analyzing user behaviors on Reddit.",
