      "content": "Neuropsychological tests are essential tools for evaluating dementia and related neurocognitive disorders, with their clinical utility determined mainly by their validity. This paper critically reviews the diverse evidence supporting the validity of neuropsychological tests in dementia assessment. Criterion validity is discussed in relation to the tests\u2019 ability to predict clinical diagnoses and underlying brain pathology, with a focus on their sensitivity to functional impairments and progressive neuropathological changes. Construct validity is explored through the lens of cognitive processes underlying test performance, using evidence from correlation structures and experimental paradigms. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of emerging digital technologies on the evaluation of neuropsychological test validity, highlighting contrasts with traditional validation methods. The review identifies discrepancies between different types of validity evidence, emphasizing the need to contextualize validity within specific clinical and research applications. By addressing the conceptual limitations and trade-offs between validation approaches, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for interpreting validity evidence. Ultimately, it offers theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the robustness of neuropsychological tests in clinical practice and research.",

      "content": "We introduce a vision transformer (ViT)-based approach for automated electrographic seizure classification using time-frequency spectrogram representations of intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected from patients implanted with the NeuroPace\u00ae RNS\u00ae System. The ViT model was trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a large-scale dataset of 136,878 iEEG recordings from 113 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, achieving an average test accuracy of 96.8%. Clinical validation was performed on an independent expert-labeled dataset of 3,010 iEEG recordings from 241 patients, where the model achieved 95.8% accuracy and 94.8% F1 score on recordings with unanimous expert agreement, outperforming both ResNet-50 and standard 2D CNN baselines. To evaluate generalizability, the model was tested on a separate out-of-distribution dataset of 136 recordings from 44 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), achieving over 75% accuracy and F1 scores across all expert comparisons. Explainability analysis revealed focused attention on characteristic electrographic seizure patterns within iEEG time-frequency spectrograms during high-confidence seizure predictions, while more diffuse attention was observed in non-seizure classifications, providing insight into the underlying decision process. By enabling reliable electrographic seizure classification, this approach may assist physicians in the manual review of large volumes of iEEG recordings.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "The influence of psychological distance and topic type on inter-brain synchronization of emotion perception during face-to-face communication: an fNIRS hyperscanning study",
      "content": "Emotional perception plays a crucial role in social interaction; however, previous studies have majorly focused on static emotion perception rather than examining how emotions unfold during communication. Therefore, this study investigated how psychological distance (friends vs. stranger pairs) and topic type (shared vs. exclusive experiences) modulate inter-brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed that: (1) shared story (vs. exclusive story) elicited higher levels of emotion perception, both for self and other (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and friends (vs. stranger) perceived their friends\u2019 negative emotions more strongly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). (2) Higher IBS was observed at the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG; BA 10) when shared story in friend than shared story in stranger (p_FWE < 0.05). The results indicate that with the deepening of friendships, the overlap between the two parties increases, resulting in higher emotional resonance when sharing common experiences. These findings provide brain imaging evidence supporting the involvement of emotion perception during communication.",

      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",
