      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> GeoPolars is a similar extension of Polars as GeoPandas is from Pandas. It was blocked by upstream issues on Polars side, but those have now been resolved. Development is restarting!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars\">GeoPolars</a> is a high-performance library designed to extend the Polars DataFrame library for use with geospatial data. Written in Rust with Python bindings, it utilizes the GeoArrow specification for its internal memory model to enable efficient, multithreaded spatial processing. By leveraging the speed of Polars and the zero-copy capabilities of Arrow, GeoPolars aims to provide a significantly faster alternative to existing tools like GeoPandas, though it is currently considered a prototype.</p> <p>Development on the project is <a href=\"https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars/issues/245#issuecomment-3568363838\">officially resuming</a> after a period of inactivity caused by upstream technical blockers. The project was previously stalled waiting for <a href=\"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\">Polars</a> to support &quot;Extension Types,&quot; a feature necessary to persist geometry type information and Coordinate Reference System (CRS) metadata within the DataFrames. With the Polars team now actively implementing support for these extension types, the primary hurdle has been removed, allowing the maintainers to revitalize the project and move toward a functional implementation.</p> <p>The immediate roadmap focuses on establishing a stable core architecture before expanding functionality. Short-term goals include implementing Arrow data conversion between the underlying Rust libraries, setting up basic spatial operations to prove the concept, and updating the Python bindings and documentation. The maintainers also plan to implement basic interoperability with GeoPandas, Shapely, and GDAL. Once this foundational structure is in place and data sharing is working, the project will actively seek contributors to help expand the library's suite of spatial operations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5dtvn/geopolars_is_unblocked_and_moving_forward/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Independent Lateralization of Language, Attention, and Numerical Cognition Across Task and Rest",
      "content": "Hemispheric functional complementarity is a core organizational principle of the human brain, yet the extent to which lateralization in one domain constrains that of others remains unclear. Two main accounts have been proposed: the causal hypothesis, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the statistical hypothesis, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using multimodal fMRI in 287 participants from the BIL&amp;GIN cohort, we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition. Task-based activation was measured during line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state functional connectivity metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains. Instead, our results support a domain-specific model in which lateralization profiles are shaped by distinct developmental and functional constraints, highlighting the need for multimodal, multi-domain approaches to brain asymmetry.",

      "content": "Cortical layer 1 plays an essential role for brain function, integrating many streams of information and undergoing synaptic plasticity during learning. Yet, we understand little of the underlying molecular processes, and whether they are specialized to achieve layer-specific functions. Here, we show that layer 1 and its synapses are metabolically active. Using laser capture RNA-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we report an abundance of synaptic transcripts localized to layer 1. We purified layer 1 excitatory and inhibitory synapses and characterized their enriched transcriptomes, identifying candidate proteins that can be locally synthesized to maintain and regulate synaptic transmission in layer 1. Furthermore, we find significant differences between the transcriptome of synapses in layer 1 and in deeper, somatic layers, suggesting that local translation might confer specialized function. Finally, by comparing our tissue data with the transcriptome from the hippocampal CA1 strata, we discover a strong similarity between cortical layer 1 and stratum lacunosum moleculare, suggesting that these distal layers share a common molecular environment. Together, our results establish that local protein synthesis is an important mechanism for layer 1, and provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcripts localized to layer 1 and its synapses.",

We generated a cellular-resolution, spatial transcriptomic atlas of the basal ganglia in human, rhesus macaque, and common marmoset, sampling over one million cells in each species. By integrating spatial data with a cross-species, consensus snRNA-seq cell type taxonomy, this atlas reveals conserved principles of molecular organization within and across structures. The cellular architecture is complex but highly stereotyped, with gene expression gradients superimposed onto discrete compartments. Extensive spatial sampling illuminates 3D gradients of molecular organization in the striatum and reveals cell type-specific core and shell compartments in the primate internal globus pallidus, which is conserved with mouse. This unified, cross-species spatial transcriptomic atlas will be a foundational resource for characterizing the molecular and functional organization of the basal ganglia and their roles in health and disease.",

      "title": "Spatial patterning of transcriptional and regulatory programs in the primate subcortex",
      "content": "Mammalian brain cell identity is shaped by intrinsic factors and external context. We present a spatially resolved transcriptomic and gene regulatory atlas of cell types found across all subcortical brain regions in a primate - the marmoset monkey. Dense sampling and cross-species integrations revealed spatially precise neuronal assemblies, including in complex structures such as hypothalamus. We find chromatin accessibility and transcriptional identity are spatially tuned within and across subcortical structures. Spatial gradients within subfields of the hippocampal formation are predominantly orchestrated by graded transcription factors coupled with graded enhancers. The primate-expanded population of GABAergic neurons in the thalamus shares transcriptional and regulatory syntax with neurons in superior colliculus, reflecting an evolutionary adaptation compared with rodents. We show that unexpected transcriptional convergence, such as between striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons and telencephalic glutamatergic neurons, can arise when distinct gene regulatory networks impinge on the same downstream genes.",

      "title": "Learning dynamically regulates stimulus discrimination of ventral striatal D1 receptor expressing neurons",
      "content": "Animals encounter a barrage of sensory stimuli, but only a subset of these are associated with appetitive outcomes, highlighting the importance of neural mechanisms for learning to distinguish reward-paired from unpaired cues. The ventral striatum plays a critical role in both reinforcement learning and stimulus discrimination, but the effect of learning on the selectivity of different cell types remains unclear. Here we examined ventral striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron (MSN) firing properties as mice learned to distinguish between reward-paired and unpaired cues. As learning progressed within a single session, D1 MSN selectivity increased linearly with behavioral selectivity, while D2 MSNs exhibited only modest, behaviorally uncorrelated changes in activity. Altered D1 MSN selectivity was primarily attributed to attenuated excitatory responses to the unrewarded cue, and increasing D1 MSN activity during the unrewarded cue impaired behavioral selectivity. Together, these findings reveal significantly more dynamic contributions of D1 MSNs to stimulus discrimination learning.",

      "title": "Dynamic methylation changes in Alzheimers disease-related genes during mindfulness practice - a proof-of-concept study",
      "content": "Background: Mindfulness meditation has gained significant attention in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its potential effects on the prevention of cognitive decline and overall psychological well-being. The epigenetic landscape of this complex neurodegenerative disorder can be influenced by environmental factors. Mindfulness practices could actively shape the biological response to AD by modifying the underlying molecular mechanisms through epigenetic regulation. Methods: A group of 17 long-term mindfulness meditators (MMs) and 17 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Experienced MMs participated in a 1-month Vipassana meditation retreat. Blood DNA methylation levels of differentially methylated genes (ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3, NXN, TREM2 and TREML2) previously validated in a predictive AD-model found analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: An increase in DNA methylation was observed for ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3 and TREM2 in MMs with respect to controls. Furthermore, significant differences were found for ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE and HOXA3 in MMs after retreat. Conclusions: DNA methylation changes identified for ADAM10 and HOXA3 in MMs are in the opposite direction to those occurring in AD and may constitute a protective epigenetic alteration. Mindfulness practice could counteract DNA methylation of key AD genes as a possible preventive strategy or non-pharmacological intervention in AD patients.",
