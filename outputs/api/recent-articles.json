      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

Cognitive function was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). P300 amplitude and latency were measured.ResultsNight-shift nurses had significantly higher ISI scores and lower MoCA attention, memory, and total scores compared to day-shift nurses (all p < 0.05). Before the intervention, After FDR correction for multiple comparisons, P300 amplitude was significantly lower at the T4 electrode site (q = 0.020) in the night-shift group. P300 latency remained significantly prolonged at sites Fz (q = 0.020), F3 (q < 0.001), F4 (q = 0.035), and T5 (q = 0.033). Post-intervention, the night-shift group demonstrated significant increases in P300 amplitude at F3, F4, T3, T4, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05) and significant reductions in P300 latency at Fz, F4, F7, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05). Notably, several sites with affected P300 amplitude and latency before the intervention showed significant improvement following intervention.ConclusionAuricular acupressure and massage significantly improved cognitive function in night-shift nurses, evidenced by enhanced P300 parameters. This non-invasive, cost-effective intervention shows promise for alleviating cognitive impairments from shift work.",

      "title": "Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia region are associated with white matter interstitial fluid content via deep medullary vein dysfunction",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS) on interstitial fluid (ISF) content in white matter and to assess the mediating role of deep medullary vein (DMV) dysfunction in this relationship among patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging and clinical data were collected from 166 patients with CSVD. EPVS score (0\u20134) was evaluated on T2-weighted images on the basis of the number of EPVS in a single slice. DMV score (0\u201318) was assigned on susceptibility-weighted imaging according to signal continuity and clarity. Free water (FW) values, representing ISF content in white matter, were derived from diffusion tensor imaging.ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 63.6 \u00b1 11.1 years. The median score was as follows: BG-EPVS, 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); centrum semiovale EPVS (CSO-EPVS), 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); CSVD score, 1 (IQR: 0\u20132), and DMV, 4 (IQR: 1\u201311). The mean FW values were 0.25 \u00b1 0.02. No significant correlation was observed between CSO-EPVS and FW (r = 0.112, p = 0.119). In contrast, BG-EPVS showed a moderate positive correlation with both DMV score (r = 0.594, p < 0.001) and FW (r = 0.521, p < 0.001). DMV score was also moderate positively correlated with FW (r = 0.557, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). Mediation analysis confirmed that DMV score significantly mediated the relationship between BG-EPVS and FW, independent of covariates.ConclusionHigher BG-EPVS score is significantly associated with increased ISF content in white matter, with DMV dysfunction serving as a key mediator of this association.",

      "title": "NBEA gene variant in a child with developmental disorder and epilepsy: a case report",
      "content": "The NBEA gene encodes Neurobeachin, a brain-specific kinase-anchoring protein that plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and synaptic regulation. Pathogenic variants in NBEA are definitively associated with neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by epilepsy, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy\u2013like phenotypes. Most reported disease-causing variants are de novo loss-of-function mutations, and although genotype\u2013phenotype correlations remain limited, early-onset generalized seizures are frequently observed. Here, we describe a Chinese child presenting with global developmental delay and recurrent seizures with febrile sensitivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while electroencephalography showed epileptiform abnormalities. Genetic analysis identified a de novo nonsense variant in the NBEA gene: c.4715C > A [p.(Ser1572Ter)]. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, the variant was classified as pathogenic. NBEA mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders with or without early-onset epilepsy. Although no additional pathogenic variants were identified in the exome, the influence of other undetected genetic or epigenetic modifiers on the observed phenotype cannot be excluded. This case therefore refines the phenotypic spectrum of NBEA-related disorders, emphasizing that the c.4715C > A [p.(Ser1572Ter)] variant may be associated with developmental impairment and epilepsy with possible febrile sensitivity.",

      "title": "The effects of sensory stimulation therapy in patients with sleep disorders: a scoping review",
      "content": "BackgroundSleep disorders are prevalent, affecting 27% of the population and linked to health issues like cognitive impairments and cardiovascular diseases. Current treatments have limitations, prompting interest in sensory stimulation therapy as an alternative approach.ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to explore the effectiveness of sensory stimulation therapy as an intervention for improving sleep disorders, as well as its range of applicability, by synthesizing existing research.MethodsUsing the methodological framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and following the PRISMA guidelines, both keywords and free-text searches were conducted. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were then selected from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wanfang Knowledge Service Platform Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. Each article was screened and analyzed according to specific research elements.ResultsA total of 20 randomized controlled trials, involving 1489 participants across 2 types of sensory stimulation therapy, namely multi-sensory and single-sensory stimulations, were included in the study. The main sensory stimuli applied were auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile, while the intervention methods included music therapy, light therapy, aromatherapy and massage therapy. The intervention duration, frequency and cycles varied considerably, but most studies implementing individual sessions lasting 20\u201360 min, at least three sessions per week. Fourteen methods were used to assess sleep quality, and the majority of studies applied two or more assessment methods. Completion rates were also high, with 85%\u2013100% of patients completing over 80% of the intervention protocol. Interestingly, 19 studies reported no adverse events. Overall, sensory stimulation therapy had a positive impact on sleep quality, particularly in aspects such as sleep latency, total sleep time, and subjective sleep experience.ConclusionThe results indicated that sensory stimulation therapy is a safe, feasible and beneficial intervention for improving sleep quality in patients with sleep disorders. However, several limitations were identified in the included studies. Future large-sample, multi-center, high-quality RCTs are needed to further verify the efficacy of this therapy, and provide stronger evidence for their clinical application.Systematic review registrationhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ2XT",
