      "title": "Assessing the digit organisation of focal hand dystonia using 7T functional MRI",
      "content": "Introduction: Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is typically treated with Botulinum Toxin (BTX/BoNT-A/Botox/ Onabotulinum Toxin Type A) injected into digit and wrist muscles to provide temporary symptomatic relief from muscle spasm. We use 7T functional MRI (fMRI) to study 1) differences in somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps between FHD individuals and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV), 2) changes in cortical digit maps of FHD individuals after BTX treatment. Methods: Six FHD patients underwent behavioural measures and 7T fMRI at two timepoints: ~30 days after BTX treatment at peak efficacy (Post-BTX), immediately prior to their next injection ~100 days after treatment when therapeutic effects had declined (Pre-BTX). HVs were scanned at a single time point. Behavioural measures included temporal discrimination (TDT), amplitude thresholding (AMP) and spatial acuity grating orientation tasks. A somatosensory travelling wave (TW) digit-mapping fMRI task was performed on dominant/affected and non-dominant/un-affected hands, and a motor TW digit-mapping task on the dominant/affected hand. Fourier analysis derived digit maps which were compared to a probabilistic digit atlas, and population receptive field (pRF) mapping performed. Structural and resting state fMRI data were acquired. Results: Spatial acuity was lowered in the dominant/affected hand in FHD compared to HVs, while TDT and AMP measures showed no significant differences. Somatosensory and motor TW cortical digit maps in FHD and HV showed clear digit ordering. Somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps were more disordered in the dominant/affected hand than the non-dominant hand for FHD Post and Pre-BTX compared to HVs (DICE coefficient/Figure of Merit). Compared to the atlas, HV maps were in-line for both hands, while in FHD central tendency (CT) was lower in the dominant/affected hand than non-dominant hand. pRF sizes were larger in the FHD Pre-BTX group compared to HV and Post-BTX for the dominant hand. Conclusion: Behaviourally, FHD participants had lower spatial acuity than HVs. FHD digit maps had typical D1-D5 ordering, but DICE coefficients identified a disordered dominant hand in FHDs compared to HVs at both timepoints. The FHD Pre-BTX group had larger pRF sizes than Post-BTX and HVs, suggesting BTX treatment coincides with more localised touch perception.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "A review of the application of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of facial paralysis",
      "content": "Facial paralysis (FP), as a highly prevalent neurological dysfunction disease worldwide, has long faced challenges such as strong subjectivity in assessment and difficulty in quantifying therapeutic effects in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. Traditional scales rely on physicians\u2019 experience. Neuroelectrophysiological examinations are invasive, while imaging evaluations are costly. The rise of intelligent sensing technology provides a new path to break through these limitations. Intelligent sensing technology has significantly improved the accuracy of FP recognition and assessment through multi-modal data fusion and dynamic monitoring. Its clinical value is not only reflected in the improvement of diagnostic efficiency, but also in promoting a fundamental change in the diagnosis and treatment model of FP. The artificial intelligence-assisted analysis mainly focuses on using machine learning algorithms to conduct in-depth exploration and analysis of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals of patients with facial paralysis, the motion trajectory data obtained through three-dimensional (3D) motion capture, as well as the data from patients\u2019 self-assessment scales. This study systematically reviews the innovative applications of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of FP, focusing on three major technical directions: sEMG, 3D motion capture, and artificial intelligence assisted analysis.",

      "title": "Aberrant static and dynamic brain functional topological organization in the differentiation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-seropositive optic neuritis from seronegative optic neuritis",
      "content": "ObjectiveAn early and accurate diagnosis of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody seropositive optic neuritis (MOG-ON) versus seronegative-ON is critical for optimal management. We aimed to explore alterations in static and dynamic functional networks for differentiation by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) with the graph theory method.MethodsRS-fMRI was performed on 53 patients (23 with MOG-ON and 30 with seronegative-ON) and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Graph theory analysis was used to investigate the topological properties of the functional networks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to determine their effectiveness in differential diagnosis.ResultsWith respect to static properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented a spectrum of abnormalities in global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Furthermore, compared with the seronegative-ON group, the MOG-ON group also presented with abnormal properties mostly located in the visual network (VN). With respect to dynamic properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented with greater variances of global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Importantly, the variances in several global and nodal properties were greater in the MOG-ON group. Compared with that in HCs, the subnetwork (24 nodes and 28 edges) in the MOG-ON patients was enhanced. For ROC analysis, the optimal diagnostic performance was obtained by combining static and dynamic approaches.ConclusionIn conclusion, abnormal topological organization of static and dynamic brain functional networks may help explore the neural mechanisms of ON in different phenotypes and serve as biomarkers for differentiation.",

      "title": "Spike-based time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model for extremely low power VLSI implementation of multi-layer neural networks",
      "content": "In deep neural network (DNN) models, the weighted summation, or multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, is an essential and heavy calculation task, which leads to high power consumption in current digital processors. The use of analog operation in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is a promising method for achieving extremely low power-consumption operation for such calculation tasks. In this paper, a time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed, and two timings proportional to the positive and negative ones are produced, respectively, in each layer. The timings are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose VLSI circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS circuit to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights. Simulation results showed that the precision was above 4-bit, and the energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 237.7 Tera Operations Per Second Per Watt (TOPS/W), more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors. Our model promises to be a suitable approach for performing intensive in-memory computing (IMC) of DNNs with moderate precision very energy-efficiently while reducing the cost of analog-digital-converter (ADC) overhead.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",
