      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "title": "Why motor learning involves multiple systems: an algorithmic perspective",
      "content": "The initial stage of learning motor skills involves exploring vast action spaces, making it impractical to learn the value of every possible action independently. This poses a challenge for standard reinforcement learning approaches, which excel in constrained domains but struggle when the space of possible actions is high-dimensional. Recent work in machine learning has sought to mitigate this problem by combining deep reinforcement learning with a supervised learning system that reduces the complexity of the control policy space by learning low-dimensional embeddings of an action space. Here, we propose that in the mammalian brain, the cortico-cerebellar network learns these low-dimensional action embeddings in a supervised way, while the basal ganglia learn value and policies in this action embedding space using reinforcement learning. We trained this model on reaching tasks and show that, contrary to traditional models of the basal ganglia, it recapitulates features of neural activity whereby similar reaching movements are associated with similar neural activity patterns in the basal ganglia. We also demonstrate a link between learning these low-dimensional action embeddings and both generalisation and the limits of multi-task adaptation in human behavioural studies. Through this framework, we propose a novel computational view of how key motor regions of the brain interact to efficiently learn a new skill.",

      "title": "Excitatory nicotinic signaling drives action potential bursting in dopaminergic axons",
      "content": "Axons of dopamine (DA) neurons express nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) that have been shown to both facilitate and suppress striatal DA release, but the mechanisms underlying these opposing actions are unclear. We combined axonal recordings and calcium imaging approaches to examine the effects of nAChRs on DAergic axon excitability. Activation of nAChRs consistently depolarized DAergic axons and increased the probability of evoking action potentials. Calcium imaging experiments showed that weak or moderate stimulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) activated DAergic axons, while strong stimulation blunted multi-pulse protocols. Axon recordings showed that highly synchronous stimulation of CINs triggered a rapid (~125 Hz) burst of 2-4 action potentials in DAergic axons. Imaging experiments showed that nAChR-evoked axon bursts led to prolonged refractoriness, which was mimicked by direct burst stimulation. Thus, nAChR activation locally enhances excitability of DAergic axons over a range of intensities, including the production of locally generated burst firing and subsequent refractory inhibition.",

      "title": "Dual cholinergic mechanisms for sculpting striatal dopamine in vivo",
      "content": "Striatal dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine constitute a computationally powerful neuromodulatory dyad that orchestrates action selection, motivational vigor, and reward learning. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) synapse onto DA axons and stimulate DA release via {beta}2-containing nicotinic receptors ({beta}2-nAChRs), providing a local modulatory channel distinct from midbrain-derived spikes. Yet whether this mechanism operates in vivo and how it contributes to striatal computations, orthogonal to those facilitated by prediction errors encoded in the DA somata, remains unresolved. Using spatiotemporally precise optogenetic stimulation of CINs paired with ultrafast DA imaging in the dorsal striatum, we identify a biphasic mode of CIN-evoked DA release in awake mice. CIN activation evoked an ultra-fast {beta}2-nAChR-dependent DA transient peaking within ~40 ms that requires millimeter-scale CIN synchrony and is systematically obscured by conventional imaging bandwidths or slow DA sensor kinetics. A second, delayed DA elevation peaking at ~180 ms persists despite {beta}2-nAChR blockade and is mediated by muscarinic receptors, - and *-nAChRs, and a non-cholinergic CIN messenger, revealing a previously unrecognized polysynaptic CIN mechanism. Our observations reconcile discrepancies between slice and in vivo studies and show that CINs engage DA release through two mechanistically distinct pathways: (i) an ultra-fast, monosynaptic mode provides a spatially expansive DA signal ideally positioned to reconfigure striatal microcircuits globally, and (ii) a slower, spatially flexible polysynaptic DA mode suited for sustaining ongoing decisions. This dual architecture expands the computational repertoire of striatal DA dynamics in behavioral and cognitive control.",

      "title": "Magnetoencephalography reveals adaptive neural reorganization maintaining lexical-semantic proficiency in healthy aging",
      "content": "Although semantic cognition remains behaviorally stable with age, neuroimaging studies report age-related alterations in response to semantic context. We aimed to reconcile these inconsistent findings by combining behavioral and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures and examined the neural mechanisms underlying lexical-semantic processing in healthy aging. Forty-six Finnish-speaking adults (25 female) across younger (22 - 32 years) and older (62 - 69 years) cohorts performed a semantic congruency judgment task on word pairs. Both age groups performed the task with high accuracy, with older adults responding faster than young. While advancing age was not associated with impaired task performance, MEG revealed neural reorganization in the old compared to young adults. Young participants exhibited the canonical N400 effect in the left temporal cortex 300 - 400 ms post-stimulus, followed by a Late Positive Complex (LPC), whereas older adults showed less pronounced congruency effects, and the activation distribution was shifted toward frontal and bilateral regions. Despite the absence of the canonical N400 effect in older participants, multivariate time-resolved decoding demonstrated that the congruency effect was decodable from the MEG responses in both groups from ~300 ms post-stimulus, indicating preserved sensitivity to congruency with age. Decoding performance correlated with response time, suggesting that increased neural separation between semantic concepts facilitates rapid decision-making. Critically, age groups were distinguishable based on their neural responses 300 - 800 ms post-stimulus, reflecting functional reorganization in older adults. Overall, our findings suggest that healthy aging involves adaptive reconfiguration of neural systems, supported by experience-driven strategies that preserve semantic proficiency despite broader age-related cognitive changes.",
