      "title": "Map of spiking activity underlying change detection in the mouse visual system",
      "content": "Visual behavior requires coordinated activity across hierarchically organized brain circuits. Understanding this complexity demands datasets that are both large-scale (sampling many areas) and dense (recording many neurons in each area). Here we present a database of spiking activity across the mouse visual system--including thalamus, cortex, and midbrain--while mice perform an image change detection task. Using Neuropixels probes, we record from >75,000 high-quality units in 54 mice, mapping area-, cortical layer-, and cell type-specific coding of sensory and motor information. Modulation by task-engagement increased across the thalamocortical hierarchy but was strongest in the midbrain. Novel images modulated cortical (but not thalamic) responses through delayed recurrent activity. Population decoding and optogenetics identified a critical decision window for change detection and revealed that mice use an adaptation-based rather than image-comparison strategy. This comprehensive resource provides a valuable substrate for understanding sensorimotor computations in neural networks.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

National guidelines recommend vision assessment following a fall; however, adherence remains suboptimal. This quality improvement project aimed to evaluate compliance with national recommendations and implement interventions to improve visual assessment rates in elderly inpatients. Methods A two-cycle retrospective cross-sectional review was conducted at a...",

A 32-year-old male with bipolar disorder and prior venous thromboembolism presented with severe occipital headache, progressive blurred vision, and a brief sensory episode. He reported recent chronic nitrous oxide use. Imaging revealed extensive thrombosis of the superior sagittal, bilateral transverse, and sigmoid sinuses with venous congestion but no infarction. Laboratory studies...",
