      "content": "Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic and progressive eye disease in which the human retina is affected by an increase in the amount of insulin in the blood. Diabetic retinopathy, if not detected and treated in time, threatens the patient's vision and eventually causes complete blindness. Among various clinical symptoms, microaneurysm appears as the first sign of diabetic retinopathy. Accurate and reliable detection of microaneurysms is a challenging problem due to its small size and low contrast....",

      "content": "In our day-to-day activities, we utilize not only the pads of our fingers but also the sides and hemispherical tips when manipulating objects. For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",

      "content": "Amputation of a lower limb not only affects mobility but also interferes with sensory feedback, leading to an elevated risk of falls among individuals living with amputation. Sensory substitution, achieved through tactile displays embedded in transfemoral prosthetic sockets, presents a promising non-invasive solution to provide artificial sensation to users. However, for this approach to be effective, users must accurately perceive distinct combinations of vibrations, a capacity limited by their...",

In a proof-of-concept driving simulator study, we evaluated a hazard warning device designed for vision impaired drivers. Three groups participated: 11 persons with central vision loss (CVL; median age 60 years), 12 with homonymous field loss (HFL; 52 years) and 11 with normal vision (NV; 60 years). CVL is characterized by impaired visual acuity and contrast sensitivity while HFL is a loss of vision in the same half of the visual...",
