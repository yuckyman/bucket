      "title": "Spatial Navigation Training Enhances Large-Scale and Small-Scale Spatial Abilities through Different Neural Mechanisms",
      "content": "Elucidating the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial abilities is fundamental to advancing our understanding of spatial cognition, with training transfer effects across tasks offering a direct means of exploration. This study investigated how large-scale spatial navigation training influences both large- and small-scale spatial abilities and their underlying neural mechanisms. Participants completed 20 days of real-world campus navigation training and performed large-scale (distance judgment) and small-scale (paper folding) spatial tasks before and after training. The training group showed significant improvements in both tasks, whereas the control group did not. Brain imaging revealed increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during large-scale task performance after training. In contrast, improvements in the small-scale task were associated with reduced deactivation in the right postcentral gyrus (PoCG), right precuneus, and left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Overall, these findings indicate that large-scale navigation training enhances spatial ability across scales through distinct neural mechanisms, supporting the partial dissociation model and highlighting the contribution of negatively activated regions to spatial processing.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Psilocybin modulates social behaviour in male and female mice in a time-dependent manner",
      "content": "With the resurgence of psychedelic research and the growing interest in their therapeutic potential, there is an urgent need to understand how these compounds act across biological sexes. Despite widespread interest in their use for conditions marked by social impairments, including depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa, the influence of sex as a biological variable (SABV) on the prosocial effects of psychedelics remains poorly understood. Indeed, enhanced connectedness, sociability and empathy are common outcomes of psychedelic use and these have shaped human social structures for millennia. Here, we investigated the sex-specific effects of a single dose of psilocybin (1.5 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice on various aspects of social behaviours. We show an intriguing connection between huddling behaviour and body temperature acutely elicited by psilocybin that was restricted to females. We also observe temporally distinct patterns of social behaviour alterations in female mice, whereby enhanced preference for social novelty was observed after acute effects subsided (4 h post-administration), which was maintained for ~24 h. Longer-term, the impact of psilocybin was reversed and promoted preference for familiar over novel conspecifics when assessed 7d post-administration, which was associated with prolonged nucleus accumbens dopamine signalling during familiar sniffing. In males, psilocybin reduced stress-related behaviours at 24 h and increased preference for familiar conspecifics, along with blunted novelty-evoked dopamine responses at both 24 h and 7 days post-treatment. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were involved in modulating these behaviours, though in sex-specific ways. These findings highlight that the prosocial effects of psychedelics are not universal and emphasize the importance of sex-informed approaches in both preclinical research and clinical application.",

      "title": "ADGRG1 blockade drives astrocyte positioning into the extracellular matrix to reduce scar size",
      "content": "After the central nervous system (CNS) injury, inflammatory cells enter the lesion core and a fibrotic extracellular matrix accumulates. Astrocytes subsequently cluster around this matrix, forming a glial scar, but the role of the extracellular matrix in scar formation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify type III collagen, a major fibrotic extracellular matrix component after spinal cord injury, as a key regulator of astrocyte behavior. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and time-lapse cell imaging, we show that type III collagen positions astrocytes at the boundary of the fibrotic matrix by activating the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1 (ADGRG1) and its downstream effector RhoA. Blocking ADGRG1 genetically or pharmacologically allows astrocytes to enter the fibrotic matrix, resulting in a smaller scar, improved neuronal regeneration, and better motor recovery. The migration of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes was inhibited by type III collagen via the ADGRG1-RhoA pathway, supporting their therapeutic potential. Our findings reveal the importance of controlling glial scar positioning via the type III collagen-ADGRG1 axis, providing a novel therapeutic target for CNS injury.",
