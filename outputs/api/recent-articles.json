      "title": "From Syllables to Words: EEG Evidence of Different Age Trajectories in Speech Tracking and Statistical Learning in Infants at High and Low Likelihood for Autism",
      "content": "Delayed onset of canonical babbling and first words is often reported in infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Identifying the neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition in ASD is therefore critical to inform early diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention strategies. In this study, we investigated two speech processing mechanisms previously identified as atypical in children and adults with ASD: the neural ability to track syllables; and statistical learning (SL), the capacity to detect speech regularities beneath surface variability. We recorded 83 longitudinal high-density EEGs from 44 infants (2.5-22.6 months) at high (HL) and low (LL) likelihood for ASD and assessed their verbal outcomes at 20 months. Neural entrainment was measured at syllable and word frequencies during exposure to a multi-speaker stream of concatenated tri-syllabic words, followed by a word recognition test using ERP recording. Our findings revealed reduced tracking abilities at the syllabic level in HL infants, a measure that correlated with verbal outcomes. While HL infants did not exhibit deficits in SL itself, they displayed reduced novelty orientation during the word recognition test, indicated by a reduced late ERP. By contrast, multi-talker variability temporarily disrupted word segmentation around 12 months in LL infants, but not in HL infants, potentially reflecting decreased sensitivity to human voices in the HL group. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal protocols employing online, implicit measures to track the hierarchical stages of speech processing in both HL and LL infants.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>For the past few months, I've been working on <strong>SottoMonte</strong>, an experimental web framework designed to push Hexagonal Architecture to its limits in Python.</p> <h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>SottoMonte is a web framework that enforces a strict separation between business logic and infrastructure. Unlike traditional frameworks, the &quot;Application&quot; core contains pure logic with models defined in JSON schema and zero external dependencies. - <strong>Framework Layer</strong>: Acts as the link between Application and Infrastructure. - <strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Everything is a plugin (Starlette for the web, Redis/Supabase for data). - <strong>UI System</strong>: Instead of standard Jinja templates, it uses a system of XML Components rendered server-side. This feels similar to Android or modern JS frameworks (component-based), but it is entirely Python-driven.</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is currently an <strong>experimental/toy project</strong> meant for research and discussion. However, the design pattern is aimed at <strong>complex enterprise systems</strong> where long-term maintainability and decoupling are critical. It is likely &quot;over-engineered&quot; for simple blogs or scripts but explores how we might structure large-scale Python applications to be independent of their frameworks.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p><strong>vs Django/FastAPI:</strong> My main frustration with frameworks like Django or FastAPI was the often inevitable coupling between business logic and infrastructure (e.g., relying heavily on ORMs or passing HTTP request objects deep into the service layer). - <strong>SottoMonte</strong> isolates the core logic completely; the core doesn't know it's running on the web or using a specific database. - <strong>UI Approach</strong>: While Django/Flask typically use text-based templating (Jinja2), SottoMonte uses structured XML widgets, allowing for a more component-driven UI development style on the server side.</p> <h3>Discussion</h3> <p>I know this approach is heavy on abstraction (e.g., repositories that treat GitHub APIs like SQL databases, UI composed of widgets). <strong>My question to you:</strong> For complex enterprise systems, do you think this level of strict abstraction is worth it? Or does the cognitive complexity outweigh the benefits of decoupling?</p> <p>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk\">https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FungoNocivo\"> /u/FungoNocivo </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[comments]</a></span>",
