      "title": "APOE4 promotes cerebrovascular fibrosis and amyloid deposition via a pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition",
      "content": "Cerebrovascular disease is a prominent but poorly understood component of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strongest genetic risk factor for AD, APOE4, is associated with multiple cerebrovascular pathologies, including vascular amyloid accumulation and fibrosis. APOE4 also renders the cerebrovasculature fragile to the point where the only disease-modifying AD therapeutic, anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, are warned against use in APOE4 carriers due to a high risk of hemorrhage and edema. To determine how APOE4 impacts cerebrovascular cells and pathogenesis, we generated a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics atlas of human cerebrovasculature from APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. In APOE4 individuals, we found that the number of microvascular pericytes was significantly reduced. Notably, loss of pericytes in APOE4 carriers was accompanied by the emergence of a unique population of mural cells characterized by high expression of contraction and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, hallmarks of myofibroblasts. Immunostaining revealed the presence of myofibroblasts surrounding the microvasculature in APOE4 human hippocampi that were absent in age-matched APOE3/3 controls, even in cases of AD. Myofibroblast presence coincided with a significant increase in fibronectin and amyloid surrounding the vasculature. Myofibroblasts were also present around the microvasculature of aged APOE4/4 but not APOE3/3 mice, suggesting myofibroblast appearance is a direct effect of the APOE4 genotype and not a technical artifact of processing human tissue. To determine the mechanisms and functional implications of APOE4-mediated myofibroblast, we leveraged a vascularized human brain tissue (miBrain) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Similar to the post-mortem human brain, APOE4/4 miBrains showed significantly reduced microvascular pericyte coverage, coinciding with the emergence of myofibroblasts co-expressing ECM and contractile genes. Lineage tracing and genetic mixing experiments confirmed that the myofibroblasts emerge from APOE4 pericytes and secrete fibronectin-rich ECM. Knocking down fibronectin in APOE4 mural cells significantly reduced vascular amyloid accumulation. To determine how myofibroblast-like cells arise in the APOE4 brain, we performed computational analysis (NicheNet) on our post-mortem human single-cell transcriptomics cerebrovascular atlas. This predicted that TGF-{beta} is the top causal driver of the pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition. Consistent with this prediction, we found that TGF-{beta} ligands in astrocytes and receptors in mural cells are significantly upregulated compared to APOE3 controls. Chemical and genetic inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling in APOE4 miBrains significantly reduced myofibroblast presence, while concurrently increasing pericyte microvascular coverage and ultimately lowering vascular fibrosis and amyloid accumulation to APOE3 levels. Using a comprehensive three-pronged approach incorporating analysis of human post-mortem brain, APOE humanized mice, and human iPSC-derived vascularized brain tissue, we demonstrate that APOE4 in mouse and human brain tissue causes increased TGF-{beta} signaling, promoting a pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition that leads to vascular fibrosis and amyloid deposition. This provides critical insight into the mechanisms underlying APOE4 cerebrovascular dysfunction, highlighting new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a major AD risk population.",

      "title": "Early Diagnosis of Parkinson via Transient Beta Frequencies in a Delayed Van der Pol Model",
      "content": "Biological motor circuits are shaped by pathway-specific delays that generate history-dependent oscillations and short-lived transients not captured by memoryless models. We develop a delayed Van der Pol in which the delay ratio r acts as a control parameter for Hopf bifurcation and internal resonance and we pair it with an auditable, short-window signal-processing pipeline tailored to early beta activity. The pipeline combines Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) ridge tracking, kernel-density estimates (KDE) of the dominant frequency, and algorithmic beta-burst detection under fixed, shared parameters. Transient burden is quantified by a metric triplet with a software-implementable attenuation rule and complemented by an early-detection index-the Transient Persistence Time. Across methods, we observe a monotonic attenuation of short-lived beta transients as r approaches a critical band. A reliable observation window of 0-0.35 s captures compact early packets at low r, progressive ridge stabilization in CWT, KDE narrowing over time, and near-elimination of bursts for near critical r, consistent with a transition to sustained narrowband rhythm. Clinically, these measures enable stage inference, a bedside Move-Stop protocol for rapid readout, and actionable policies for adaptive DBS and medication titration that minimize transient burden without inducing rigid locking. The fixed parameterization and audit-ready outputs support reproducibility and multi-center deployment. This framework advances data-driven, precision neuromodulation by targeting early transients before pathological synchrony becomes entrenched.",

      "title": "3D MINFLUX combined with DNA-PAINT resolves the arrangement of Bassoon at active zones",
      "content": "Neurotransmitter release and membrane retrieval at active zones require precise spatial and temporal coordination relying on an intricate molecular machinery. However, the exact nano-structural organization of this machinery is not yet fully elucidated. Here, we used 3D MINFLUX combined with both spectral demixing and DNA-PAINT to analyze the positioning of the scaffolding protein Bassoon at presynaptic active zones of glutamatergic spine synapses of hippocampal neurons, achieving a localization precision of 5 nm in 3D. This approach allowed us to visualize directly the distribution of N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of Bassoon, and demonstrates that Bassoon exhibits an orientation at the active zone, where the C-terminal region is directed toward the synaptic cleft and the N-terminal region towards synaptic vesicles. Having demonstrated this spatial configuration in an exemplary fashion for endogenous and recombinant Bassoon molecules, our study paves the way towards molecular-scale resolution analysis of other prominent proteins of the presynaptic release machinery.",

      "title": "Elevated IL-1 beta plasma levels, altered platelet activation and cardiac remodeling lead to moderately decreased LV function in Alzheimer transgenic mice after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion",
      "content": "Introduction: Neurodegeneration and dementia are key factors in Alzheimers disease (AD). The deposition of amyloid-beta into senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are the main clinical parameters of AD. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and AD share a comparable pathophysiology. In detail, AMI survivors have a higher risk of vascular dementia and AD patients with AMI face a poor prognosis with a high rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. High blood levels of amyloid-beta 40 are identified in patients with high risk for cardiovascular death. However, the underlying mechanisms and the consequences of AMI in AD patients are unclear to date. Methods: AD transgenic APP23 mice were analysed in an experimental AMI using the closed-chest model. Results: APP23 mice displayed significantly decreased left ventricular function as detected by FS/MPI (fractional shortening/myocardial performance index) after 24 h and 3 weeks after ligation of the LAD compared to WT controls. No differences have been observed in infarct and scar size. However, the analysis of cardiac remodeling after 3 weeks showed an altered composition of the collagen tissue of the scar with elevated tight but reduced fine collagen in APP23 mice. Altered scar formation was accompanied by elevated degranulation of platelets following activation of the collagen receptor GPVI. Conclusion: The here presented results suggest that AD patients are at higher risk for cardiac damage after AMI that might increase the risk for cardiovascular death. This implies the need of a personalized therapy of AMI in AD patients.",

      "title": "The 5-HT1A receptor agonist NLX-112 rescues motor swimming deficits in Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 mice",
      "content": "Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which causes progressive motor disturbances. There is no approved drug treatment but selective activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors may be a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate ataxia symptoms. Methods: NLX-112, a highly selective 5-HT1A full agonist, was tested in the CMVMJD135 transgenic mouse model of SCA3. NLX-112 (1.25 and 5 mg/kg/day) was administered BID intraperitoneally for 14 weeks starting when the mice were 12 weeks of age, i.e., after ataxia signs had become established. The motor swimming test (MST), where mice are required to swim to a raised platform, was used to evaluate the motor behavior of SCA3 mice and their performance was compared with that of wild-type (WT) mice. Results: Both doses of NLX-112 were well tolerated by the SCA3 mice, as assessed by welfare parameters. In the MST, the latency of SCA3 mice to reach the platform was significantly longer than that of WT mice. However, when SCA3 mice were treated with either 1.25 or 5 mg/kg/day of NLX-112, they showed robust improvement of motor performance, with swimming latencies which were similar to those of WT mice. This effect of NLX-112 was maintained throughout the period of the study. Conclusions: The improved motor function of SCA3 mice when treated with NLX-112 supports its investigation as a drug candidate for the treatment of ataxia and related movement disorders.",
