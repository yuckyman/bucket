      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "Grey matter embedding of the cholinergic system",
      "content": "Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter for neurodevelopment and brain functioning. Historically, measuring cholinergic effects in living brains required invasive and irradiating procedures, severely limiting our understanding of this system in health and disease. Here, we developed a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging-based approach to evaluate how cholinergic synapses shape the brain's macroanatomical architecture in exploration (n=1113) and replication cohorts (n=587) of healthy adults. Spatial colocalization of presynaptic acetylcholine transporters emphasized a cholinergic basis of grey matter coupling between basal forebrain and its corticopetal projection targets amygdala, insula and cingulate cortices. Unexpectedly, covarying grey matter regions mimicked the density topographies of M1- muscarinic and 4{beta}2-nicotinic receptors beyond predominant target regions and highlighted effect of the brain's overall cholinergic neuronal populations. The results establish the basis for non-invasive assessments of cholinergic contributions to neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies, and pave the way for neuroimaging-guided pharmacological indications of muscarinic antipsychotics, nicotinic anti-addiction and cholinergic anti-dementia drugs.",

      "title": "A novel key player in cognitive striatal processes: the Pthlh interneurons",
      "content": "Interneurons in the dorsal striatum provide essential modulatory control over the projecting neurons, known as medium spiny neurons (MSNs), regulating the output of this brain structure, which is critical for motor control, decision-making, and learning. The diversity of interneurons has been recently determined based on single-cell transcriptomic analyses identifying novel populations as the Pthlh-expressing interneurons, one of the most abundant and distinctive inhibitory populations in the human and mouse striatum. Here, we generated a novel Pthlhcre knock-in mouse line that enables comprehensive study of this critical population. Quantitative histological analyses show that this line effectively targets the Pthlh interneuron class, which appears as a stable population across age, sex and the anterior-posterior axis. To elucidate their functional role, we performed selective chemogenetic inhibition of Pthlh interneurons, which caused significant impairments in striatum-dependent cognitive functions and reduced exploratory behaviorur. Importantly, selective silencing did not affect basal locomotion, motor coordination, or anxiety-like behavior. Monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed that Pthlh interneurons receive dense local input from MSN subtypes and diverse long-range afferents from thalamic and different cortical regions. We further confirm that this population displays electrophysiological heterogeneity encompassing fast-spiking and fast-spiking-like phenotypes. Overall, our findings establish Pthlh interneurons as a major inhibitory class essential for cognitive processing-but not gross motor function-acting as key integrators of local MSN feedback and thalamocortical signals. The novel Pthlhcre mouse line provides a valuable resource for future studies of inhibitory diversity in basal ganglia function and related neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Myelin density dictates region-specific vulnerability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during aging",
      "content": "Aging of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to a progressive decline in numerous physiological functions. This decline can be attributed in part to alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage, which comprises myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and their progenitors, NG2-glia, that play a central role in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring proper myelin turnover. While NG2-glia are distributed throughout the CNS, OLs are enriched in highly myelinated regions, implying spatially heterogeneous requirements for NG2-glia proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, age-related impairments in these progenitor functions may differentially compromise oligodendrogenesis and myelin maintenance across distinct CNS compartments. Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of aging-associated alterations within the oligodendrocyte lineage remains insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of aging across three age groups in two anatomically adjacent but functionally distinct CNS regions, the cortical gray matter (GM) and the corpus callosum (CC). We demonstrated that aging is accompanied by a marked decline in the NG2-glia population. Aging NG2-glia displayed cell cycle dysregulation, characterized by reduced proliferative and differentiative capacity and accompanied by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), indicating disrupted homeostatic regulation. These alterations were most pronounced in highly myelinated regions, which also exhibited a stronger shift toward an age-associated inflammatory milieu. In parallel, we observed substantial accumulation of myelin debris and impaired phagocytic clearance in these myelin-dense areas. Moreover, we identified a selective loss of myelinating OLs in the CC, a phenomenon not detected in the gray matter (GM). Together, our findings delineate a tight interdependence between regional myelin density, inflammatory status, and the vulnerability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to aging. These highlight multiple entry points of potential therapeutic intervention to mitigate CNS aging.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "content": "Neuritin is a conserved, activity-regulated gene encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, crucial for neural development, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. Identified via activity-dependent gene screening in the rat hippocampus, neuritin promotes neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and synaptic maturation with neural activity. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding neuritin\u2019s signaling pathways, neuroprotective, neuroregenerative, and neuromodulatory properties, with a focus on its therapeutic potential to counter neurodegeneration in various conditions such as glaucoma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, recent studies reveal roles in immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and cancer biology, highlighting neuritin as a versatile signaling molecule with broad therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Auditory object segmentation amplifies prediction error signals in a complex MMN paradigm",
      "content": "Auditory deviance detection depends on the segmentation of sound sequences into perceptually meaningful units, which provide the basis for predictive models. Complex mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigms, including dual-rule designs, place higher demands on these processes because regularities are defined by relationships across tones rather than by single features. However, it remains unclear how facilitation of auditory segmentation influences MMN. To address this, we compared MMN elicited during a dual-rule paradigm under continuous versus temporally segmented (750\u202fms gap) conditions in thirty-two participants using simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings. Two 50-ms binaural pure tones were presented in pairs. Tone A was a 1\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the right ear, and Tone B was a 1.2\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the left ear. Within each pair, tones followed with a 330\u202fms Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), with standards consisting of A-B pairs (85.6%) and deviants of A-A pairs (14.3%). Two conditions were used: a No-Gap condition, where pairs followed continuously with a 330\u202fms SOA, and a Gap condition, where pairs were separated by a longer 750\u202fms SOA. Results at EEG FCz revealed dual-rule MMN amplitudes (130\u2013230\u202fms) were not significantly different between No-Gap and Gap conditions (t(29)\u202f=\u202f0.93; p\u202f=\u202f0.36; d\u202f=\u202f0.17). Conversely, MEG source-localized responses in bilateral primary auditory cortex (A1) revealed larger MMN responses in the Gap condition relative to No-Gap (F(1,31)\u202f=\u202f26.07, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.457). This suggests that temporal segmentation facilitates the grouping of tone pairs into perceptual objects, allowing the auditory system to form predictions not only at the level of individual tones, but also at the level of the tone pair as a perceptual unit. Deviants in this context violate both low-level features (pitch and location) and the higher-order pair structure, producing larger prediction error signals. These results provide insight into how the auditory system integrates local and higher-order regularities, offering a mechanistic link between auditory scene analysis and hierarchical predictive coding in complex auditory environments.",
