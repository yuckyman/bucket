      "title": "Cross-region neuron co-firing mediated by ripple oscillations supports distributed working memory representations.",
      "content": "High-frequency (~90Hz) ripple oscillations may promote integrative processing in mammalian brains. Previous work has demonstrated that the co-occurrence of these ripple oscillations is associated with enhanced temporal binding of neural activity between human cortical neurons separated by up to 12mm. However, it remains unclear whether co-ripple facilitation of neuronal coupling supports cognitive processing, or if it occurs at greater distances. Here, we analyze intracranial recordings from patients implanted with microwire electrodes in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area, bilaterally, during a working memory task. We demonstrate that ripple oscillations significantly increase in all recorded regions, during encoding, maintenance and retrieval. Furthermore, co-occurrence of ripples increases between brain regions, associated with ~30% increases in cross-region co-firing, both without decrement over distances up to 220 mm. These increases in cross-regional co-rippling and associated co-firing scale with memory load during maintenance and retrieval. Critically, during retrieval, co-ripples promote the reinstatement of the stimulus-specific long-distance co-firing patterns observed during encoding, especially during rapid recognition. Our findings reveal that ripple oscillations orchestrate long-range neural communication that supports distributed neural representations during human cognition.",

      "title": "TBK1 activity regulates the directionality of axonal transport of signalling endosomes",
      "content": "The polarised and complex morphology of neurons pose massive challenges for efficient cargo delivery between the axon and soma, a process termed axonal transport. We have previously shown that the retrograde axonal transport of pro-survival, neurotrophic signalling endosomes relies on Rab7 in motor neurons, and that their trafficking is impaired in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. Here, we report the effect of Rab7 phosphorylation on the transport of these signalling endosomes. We show that the ALS-linked kinase TBK1 phosphorylates Rab7 at S72 in neurons, altering its binding to cytoplasmic dynein adaptors. Accordingly, both TBK1 knockdown and the expression of a loss-of-function Rab7 mutant (S72E) induce aberrant bidirectional movement of signalling endosomes without modifying neuronal polarity or endosomal sorting. This alteration is specific for signalling endosomes, as axonal transport of lysosomes and mitochondria remain unaffected. We have therefore discovered a new TBK1 function that ensures the unidirectional transport of signalling endosomes, suggesting that reduced TBK1 activity determines retrograde transport dysfunctions and long-range signalling impairments.",

Policymakers in Mexico and countries with Mexican populations should prioritize effective eye health for marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution to include eye care in universal health coverage can reach those most affected.",

While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",

There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",
