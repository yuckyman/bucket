      "title": "A multi-input optic glomerulus mediates opposing behavioral responses to visual objects",
      "content": "Prey, predators or conspecifics are first detected as visual objects in seeing animals. Vision guides behavioral actions towards or away from these objects. An error in this visual perception could prove fatal. How object information is untangled to avoid errors remains unclear. Here we show that LC10d visual projection neurons in Drosophila melanogaster mediate avoidance of visual objects devoid of a chemosensory profile. LC10d neurons are broadly tuned to objects and project to same retinorecipient brain region that receives inputs from LC10a neurons, which are required for tracking. The descending neurons DNa10 are directly downstream of the anterior-looking LC10d sub-population and mediate LC10d-dependent avoidance. Our work demonstrates the use of two similar neuron types and chunking of the visual field as strategies to disentangle similar sets of visual cues. Discrete objects are avoided until chemosensory information is gathered to enable decision making on whether to engage in social interactions or rather to avoid them.",

      "content": "Systemic hypertension is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, yet the mechanistic basis connecting the two conditions remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that hypertensive rats develop accelerated retinal degeneration characterized by retinal thinning, functional impairment, reduced perfusion, and progressive neuroinflammation. Critically, these changes occur despite persistently lower intraocular pressure (IOP), indicating an IOP-independent mechanism of pathology. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identified a robust activation of the retinal endothelin system, with endothelin-2 (EDN2) being the earliest and most significantly upregulated component. AAV-delivered retinal Edn2 knockdown completely restored retinal function, ameliorated neuroinflammation, and enhanced retinal blood flow in hypertensive rats. Pharmacological blockade of endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), but not type B, replicated these protective effects without altering IOP. Our findings establish EDN2 as a central, IOP-independent driver of hypertension-associated retinal neurodegeneration and identify the endothelin-EDNRA axis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent vision loss in hypertensive patients.",

      "title": "Personalized smartphone notifications bias auditory salience across processing stages",
      "content": "Modern digital environments expose the brain to a dense stream of personally meaningful cues that differ markedly from the conditions under which sensory systems evolved. Understanding how the brain responds and adapts to such environments is increasingly relevant for cognitive and mental well-being. In this study, we used auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a task-irrelevant auditory oddball paradigm to obtain a time-resolved account of neural responses to smartphone notifications. We dissociated the effects of generic notification sounds from the learning-related effects of personalized notification sounds, and examined how these responses varied across levels of smartphone use. Among early stages of processing, generic tones exhibited experience-dependent strengthening of auditory representations, whereas personalized tones engaged stable, pre-learned representations, as reflected in P2 dynamics. The strongest stimulus-dependent modulation was observed in pre-attentive salience detection, reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN), which was earlier and larger for personalized tones compared to generic ones. At later stages, attentional orienting and extended evaluative processing showed distinct patterns that were differentially sensitive to stimulus identity and smartphone use. Notably, smartphone usage levels modulated later attentional and evaluative stages (P3a and LPP) without altering early pre-attentive prediction-error signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate that personalized smartphone notifications do not uniformly increase neural distraction. Instead, they engage robust and rapid pre-attentive prediction-error signaling that is largely independent of usage, while habitual smartphone use selectively shapes later attentional orienting and evaluative dynamics.",

      "title": "First In Vivo Demonstration of Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery of Memantine Using NosaPlugs Nasal Inserts",
      "content": "Treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge due to ineffective drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, intranasal administration has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for nose-to-brain delivery. Compared to other routes of administration, nose-to-brain delivery provides a possibility of bypassing both the blood-brain-barrier and the first-pass metabolism in the liver, allowing for a decrease in the delivered dose and thereby a reduced risk of systemic side-effects. While the most common nasal devices, spray pumps, ensure a wide distribution in the nasal cavity and a fast onset of action, a slower release and increased retention time is desired for treatment of many neurological disorders. In this study, we tested the feasibility of a novel nasal insert, NosaPlugs, for prolonged release and delivery of memantine. Using an in vitro anatomically realistic nasal model, we demonstrated cumulative release of memantine from the nasal inserts up to eight hours. Additionally, the therapeutic substance was distributed to all parts of the nasal cavity, with higher amounts accumulating in the middle part. In vivo, an acute dose of memantine in the gas phase released from the nasal device reached pharmacologically relevant levels in both plasma and the brains of the mice. Future research should investigate the release and delivery of alternative substances interesting for brain diseases, and larger animal models are required to determine the efficacy of nose-to-brain delivery using NosaPlugs nasal inserts. Importantly, our study provides the first proof-of-concept that NosaPlugs can serve as an effective intranasal device for targeted drug delivery to the brain.",

      "title": "Calcium-binding protein expression alone is insufficient to identify and classify GABAergic neurons in macaque cortex",
      "content": "Understanding neuron subclasses and their functional consequences can contribute to understanding brain circuits. A scheme long used to classify GABAergic neurons in the neocortex is based on expression of three calcium-binding proteins (CBPs): parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR). Because CB and CR are frequently co-expressed by individual neurons in rodents, this scheme has been replaced by one based on PV and two signaling peptides: somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In macaques, however, CBPs are generally not co-expressed, and so their use has persisted despite suggestions that the underlying populations are not, in fact, entirely GABAergic. We set out to quantitatively evaluate CBPs as a classification scheme for GABAergic neurons in early and mid-level visual regions in macaque cortex. Combining immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we find that up to half of neurons expressing CBPs are likely not GABAergic. Furthermore, contrary to what has been previously suggested, the GABAergic subpopulations cannot be distinguished based on staining intensity. Thus, the CBP-based classification scheme is not valid, at least as it has traditionally been used. Instead, we find support for co-labeling CB and CR neurons with SST and VIP, an approach that can identify GABAergic subpopulations within the CBP classes; or simply adopting the PV/SST/VIP scheme. We discuss the functional implications of expressing these various cell type markers, and how consideration of marker functions can support proper selection of a classification scheme for a given experimental purpose.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.
