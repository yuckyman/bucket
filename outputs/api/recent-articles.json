      "content": "Brain magnetic resonance imaging serves as a cornerstone of preoperative neurosurgical assessment. Neural fields represent an emerging machine learning approach capable of super-resolution reconstruction and novel view synthesis without requiring large training datasets. Ten 1.5-Tesla brain MRI sequences (nine anisotropic and one isotropic) were used to train patient-specific neural field models using a closed source machine learning framework (Radscaler). Image quality assessment was performed on reconstructions upscaled by factors of 2, 3, and 4 relative to original resolution. The method achieved favorable quality metrics across all scaling factors: mean (sd) SSIM of 0.85 (0.04), MS-SSIM of 0.95 (0.01), and LPIPS of 0.09 (0.04). Neural field reconstruction enabled enhanced visualization of micro-anatomical structures through improved spatial resolution and interpolation of intermediate views not present in the original acquisition. These findings demonstrate that neural fields provide a clinically viable approach for volumetric MRI super-resolution and novel view synthesis, particularly valuable for addressing anisotropic acquisition limitations in neurosurgical planning.",

      "title": "Inferring learning rules during de novo task learning",
      "content": "Identifying the learning rules that govern behavior is a central problem in neuroscience. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a unifying theoretical framework, most empirical studies of animal learning behavior have focused on non-stationary environments (e.g. changing reward probabilities in a known task), as opposed to acquiring an entirely new task from scratch. Here we introduce a statistical framework to infer reinforcement learning rules directly from single-animal behavior. Applied to mice learning a perceptual decision-making task, our approach reveals that policy-gradient-like rules capture de novo task learning better than classical temporal-difference algorithms. By fitting flexible parametric learning rules, we uncover systematic deviations from standard RL models, including side-specific learning rates and negative reward baselines. Together, these parameters account for side-biased learning, as well as forgetting and consecutive errors due to aversive responses to incorrect trials. Extending the framework with latent, dynamic learning rates further reveals that animals adapt their learning rates over training and across curricula. These results provide a statistical account of how animals learn from scratch and highlight key departures from classical reinforcement learning algorithms.",

      "title": "Working memory expands shared task representations in cortex",
      "content": "Cognition is thought to emerge from the flexible organization of neural activity, yet how this organization reconfigures across behaviors varying in cognitive load remains unclear. We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.",

      "title": "Sensorimotor beta burst dynamics and interhemispheric connectivity in children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "content": "Activity in the beta frequency band appears to play a critical role in various sensorimotor processes, with transient \"bursts\" of beta displaying distinct waveform motifs reflecting different neural processes. However, much remains unknown about how beta bursts develop, and hence the role they may play in sensorimotor difficulties associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we used EEG to investigate sensorimotor beta bursts in children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD), which is associated with impaired motor control and atypical brain connectivity. However, the neural dynamics underlying these differences remain unclear. We characterized beta bursts during action execution and observation of gross and fine motor actions. Although overall burst features were similar across groups in the spectral domain, children with DCD showed disrupted rate modulation of specific burst waveform motifs, characterized by atypical lateralization and altered interhemispheric connectivity. These disruptions were strongest for a subset of burst types identified by principal component analysis, and individual differences in motif-specific burst rates correlated with motor ability. Our findings suggest that selective recruitment of distinct beta burst motifs and related disruption of interhemispheric communication may represent an important mechanism underlying motor difficulties in DCD. This work highlights the importance of burst waveform diversity for understanding typical and atypical motor development.",

      "title": "Neural dynamics reveal foraging-like computations in the frontal cortex",
      "content": "The prefrontal cortex has a central role in flexible behavior. Computations for weighing alternatives, committing to an option, integrating evidence, and abandoning an option are dominantly formalized in reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, ecological considerations showcase foraging as a competing account. Identifying how the brain actually solves efficient weighing of options requires the identification of the neural representation of this abstract yet precise computation. We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations. We demonstrated that MCC dynamics showed signatures of foraging-like computation but conflicted with RL requirements. Our study thus provides a detailed neural account of foraging-like flexibility in the primate frontal cortex.",
