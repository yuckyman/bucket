      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Neurophysiology of mismatch negativity generation: a biophysical modeling study",
      "content": "The mismatch negativity, or MMN, is a ubiquitous evoked brain response elicited by any discriminable change of an otherwise regular stimulus sequence. Despite its potential clinical relevance - the MMN is known to be affected by brain state, lesions, and neurologic/psychiatric disorders - and a growing body of animal work, the underlying neurophysiology of the MMN is not well understood. This hinders translation of circuit-level animal findings and mitigates the utility of the MMN as a neurologic/psychiatric biomarker. Here, we used biophysical modeling to examine the neurophysiological basis of the MMN as measured in a canonical auditory oddball paradigm with frequency deviants (i.e., tones whose frequency was shifted slightly with respect to standard tones). The response to standards was successfully modeled by a typical feedforward-followed-by-feedback input sequence. The response to deviants required additional, prolonged input to supragranular layers, consistent with input from the non-lemniscal thalamus. This additional input resulted in downward-going pyramidal-neuron currents in both layer 2/3 (via indirect somatic inhibition) and, critically, layer 5 (via direct apical excitation), which together generated the MMN. The results suggest that current circuit-level models of MMN generation derived from animal models are incomplete, and that further work is required to characterize the underlying neurophysiology of the MMN.",

      "title": "Precision functional imaging in infants using multi-echo fMRI at 7T",
      "content": "Personalized functional brain developmental trajectories can be studied with Precision Functional Mapping (PFM). Our previous work has demonstrated that PFM can be achieved in infants despite rapid brain growth. However, even with extensive data collection (up to 1 hour of fMRI), the reliability and precision of these maps remain lower than those observed in youth and adults - particularly within subcortical structures. In this work we demonstrate the utility of high-field 7T MRI compared to 3T MRI for facilitating PFM in infants. We showcase data from multi-echo fMRI acquisitions in the same infants at both 7T and 3T and demonstrate that 7T imaging in infants is safe and feasible with our subject-specific safety workflow. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of a higher magnetic field strength affords a spatial resolution more appropriately matched to infants' smaller head and brain sizes, yielding notable improvements in data quality, especially for PFM. The increase in both spatial precision and reliability also suggests that 7T MRI can reduce the amount of data required for PFM. Last, we show how ultra-high field imaging can help us study the development of subcortical-to-cortical connectivity patterns, crucial for understanding brain development during this developmental window. 7T MRI is a promising new avenue for developmental cognitive neuroscience.",

      "title": "Inter- and intra-individual differences in temporal modulation patterns of the \u03b2-band sensorimotor rhythm and its relationship to corticomuscular coherence during intermittent voluntary contraction",
      "content": "The {beta}-band sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), recorded using electroencephalography, generally desynchronizes from motor preparation and subsequently synchronizes with electromyogram signals during voluntary contraction, thus forming corticomuscular coherence (CMC). However, it remains unclear how the temporal modulation of {beta}-band SMR varies among individuals, potentially leading to individual differences in CMC. It is also unclear how the nervous system modulates {beta}-band SMR to meet varying task demands within individuals. Here, we explored how temporal modulation patterns of {beta}-band SMR affect CMC from two perspectives: inter-individual differences (Experiment 1), and intra-individual variability depending on task demands (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants repeated a steady-force maintenance task. The degree of {beta}-band SMR modulation (i.e., rebound from desynchronization to synchronization) during contractions varied greatly among individuals and was positively correlated with CMC magnitude. This suggests that even under steady-force maintenance, the motor control strategy used while regulating {beta}-band SMR varies greatly among individuals. In Experiment 2, participants who showed significant CMC in Experiment 1 performed four tasks with varying target trajectories. Even within individuals, the degree of {beta}-band SMR modulation was reduced in parallel with the CMC magnitude as more difficult force adjustment was required. This finding suggests that, when confronted with more challenging task demands, our nervous system reduces the oscillation of SMR and desynchronizes its coupling with muscles. Overall, the way in which our nervous system regulates {beta}-band SMR is assumed to represent a strategy for flexible adaptation to diverse motor environments.",

      "title": "The Road Not Taken: Unsaid Word Alternatives are Represented in the Brain",
      "content": "Human language allows multiple ways to express the same thought, implying that several lexical alternatives may exist in parallel before a single word is spoken or heard. We test the multiple alternatives-co-activation hypothesis by combining high-density ECoG during spontaneous dialogue with behavioral paradigms and ranked next-word predictions from large language models (LLMs). Behaviorally, words that LLMs rank as more likely continuations are recognized faster in a preregistered lexical decision task and produced with shorter inter-word intervals in free speech, indicating graded anticipatory activation of alternatives. Neurally, encoding models reveal that activity in classical language regions (IFG, STG) prior to word onset is predicted by embeddings of multiple top-ranked alternatives, not only by the word ultimately used; critically, mean embeddings that pool the top candidates outperform single-candidate embeddings, and the effect persists with arbitrary (non-semantic) embeddings that control for distributional similarity. Extending beyond a handful of options, encoding strength increases as embeddings are averaged across larger top-k sets, implying that a broad cohort of lexical candidates is simultaneously represented. Finally, models trained in comprehension generalize to production (and vice versa), preserving rank order and suggesting a shared neural code for candidate sets across modalities. Together, these findings provide direct evidence that the brain co-activates unsaid alternatives during natural language use and identify parallel candidate activation as a computational principle common to human comprehension, human production, and artificial language modeling.",

      "title": "Reading ability in both deaf and hearing adults is linked to neural representations of abstract phonology derived from visual speech",
      "content": "Learning to read provides access to life-long educational and vocational opportunities. Some, but not all, deaf children find learning to read challenging, due to reduced access to language, whether spoken or signed. In hearing children, the ability to access and manipulate well-specified, abstract \"phonological representations\" of spoken language is important for developing strong reading skills. However, the role that phonology plays in deaf children learning to read is much less clear. Positive associations between speechreading (lip reading) and text reading have been observed in deaf and hearing children, and deaf adults, suggesting that speechreading may play a role in reading development, regardless of hearing status. Further support for this hypothesis would be provided by evidence that similar neural representations of phonology are evoked by visual speech and other language forms (auditory speech and text), and that these neural representations are related to reading proficiency. We used fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to identify shared neural representations of phonology. A group of deaf adult participants (N=22), with a mixture of sign language and spoken language backgrounds and reading abilities, were presented with single lexical items as visual speech and text. Adult hearing participants (N=25) were presented with the same words, but as visual speech and auditory speech. We hypothesised that common neural representations of phonological structure of English words would be found in each group in the superior and middle temporal cortex (STC/MTC) and that these shared representations would be more similar across different language forms in better readers. Our data supported these predictions providing neurobiological evidence of the contribution of visual speech to abstract phonological representations, that relate to reading proficiency, in both deaf and hearing adults.",

      "content": "The human brain is part of a moving body. Yet cognitive neuroscience has long treated body movements as artifacts, leaving unclear how neural computations and overt actions combine to support cognition. Here, we propose that targeted head rotations act as behavioral filters of relevant input under distraction. We show that selective attention is jointly implemented by neural filtering (lateralization of alpha oscillations) and head rotation. In a cued auditory spatial attention task, N = 33 human participants attended to lateral targets or ignored lateral distractors. Neural oscillatory activity, the electrooculogram (EOG), and head movements were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and a head-mounted gyroscope. In half of the trials, we purposefully allowed free movements of the head. Listeners exhibited robust patterns of head rotation towards lateral targets, which improved task accuracy by reducing target uncertainty. Note that significant movement residues remained even when head motion was discouraged. Neural filtering, measured as decreased alpha oscillations contralateral to targets and vice versa for distractors, was assessable for conditions with and without head movement permitted but did not relate to task accuracy. Critically, neural and behavioral filters were positively linked on a trial-by-trial and on a between-subject level, with neural filtering preceding behavioral filtering in time. Together, these results underscore that selective attention arises from coordinated brain-body dynamics, highlighting the need to integrate overt movement into mechanistic models of cognition.",

      "title": "Neural recordings of continuous speech reveal robust signatures of prediction in second language learners of English",
      "content": "When listening to speech in their native language, speakers use prior context to anticipate upcoming phonemes, words, and concepts, integrating information at the sublexical, lexical, and sentence level. While it has been suggested that late second language learners do not predict to the same extent as native listeners, adequately evaluating this claim requires measurement of predictions at these multiple levels of representation simultaneously in natural speech. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses from native Mandarin and Sinhala speakers listening to continuous narrative English speech. We used multivariate temporal response function (mTRF) analysis to investigate whether second language listeners demonstrate the same markers of prediction in neural data as native English speakers listening to the same stimuli. We demonstrate that late second language listeners exhibit strikingly similar responses to native speakers in sensitivity to phoneme surprisal and entropy with respect to sublexical, lexical, and sentence-level context. The few small response differences we observed appear most likely to arise from specific properties of the native languages, rather than general differences between native and second-language listening. These results provide evidence that late second-language listeners indeed leverage prediction in similar ways as native listeners in understanding continuous speech. This suggests that multivariate analyses of neural data from naturalistic listening may be vital in carefully evaluating the differences and similarities in speech prediction across populations.",

      "content": "Intermanual transfer refers to the improvement of motor skill in an untrained contralateral limb following unilateral limb practice. However, it remains uncertain whether motor skill in the lower limb (LL) can improve as a result of practice with the unilateral upper limb (UL). Forty-five healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) UL group, which practiced reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left upper limb; or (2) switches observation (SO) group, which observed the same RM sequences; or (3) nature observation (NO) group, which observed nature movies. RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "content": "Understanding how the human brain differentiates between active engagement and passive observation is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. Using a matched-stimulus driving paradigm to isolate engagement from sensory input, we recorded whole-brain EEG while participants performed a manual control task and passively viewed a replay of their own performance. Manual control elicited distinct spectral signatures, including stronger frontal midline theta power and, paradoxically, greater occipital alpha power, consistent with heightened cognitive control and active attentional filtering. While a classifier could distinguish these states with high within-subject accuracy, performance declined in cross-subject validation, highlighting inter-individual variability. These findings delineate the distinct neural signatures of active versus passive engagement under controlled conditions. This work establishes a foundational neurophysiological baseline that can inform research on cognitive state monitoring and the design of neuroadaptive systems in complex human-machine interaction.",

      "title": "Multitarget neurostimulation of the deep brain: clinical opportunities, challenges, and emerging technologies",
      "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",
