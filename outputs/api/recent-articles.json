      "title": "Pathway Anchored Multimodal Clustering Reveals Circuit Level Signatures in Parkinsons Disease",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease is increasingly understood as a disorder of distributed brain circuits, yet most imaging analyses do not explicitly respect pathway structure. We introduce a pathway anchored, multimodal clustering framework based on Scalable Robust Variational Compositional Co-clustering (SRVCC) that integrates structural MRI, free water corrected diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT in anatomically defined circuits. For each pathway, we derive a simple Multimodal Pathway Integrity Score (MPIS) that aggregates z normalised volume, microstructural, and dopaminergic measures into an interpretable summary of imaging integrity. In the PPMI cohort, SRVCC identifies stable imaging-derived patient clusters and feature modules under explicit model selection and bootstrap/stability checks, with covariate-adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, education, medication, and scanner. MPIS shows coherent but modest structure function associations: lower nigrostriatal and frontostriatal integrity relates to higher motor burden (UPDRS-III), while reduced sensory/visuospatial and limbic integrity is linked to lower global cognition (MoCA); microvascular markers robustly stratify imaging profiles but display minimal cross-sectional coupling to these global scales. Feature-level reports highlight dominant region by modality contributors (e.g., striatal DAT-SBR, thalamic and cerebellar morphology, white-matter hyperintensity metrics), providing a transparent bridge from multimodal data to circuit-level signatures. This pathway-aware representation offers a principled, reproducible way to summarise multimodal imaging in PD and may support future work on circuit-informed stratification, prognosis, and targeted outcome measures.",

      "title": "The Role of Temporal Factors in Processing Rapid Serial Visual Presentations",
      "content": "Sequentially presented visual stimuli are often employed to investigate the temporal limits of our visual perception and attention. Due to the finite nature of the brains' processing capacity, experimental designs attempt to increase temporal separation within series to mitigate potential neural interference between stimuli. This is achieved through shortening of stimulus durations and lengthening of interstimulus intervals. Across two experiments, we parametrically varied these parameters for a serially presented checkerboard wedge stimulus and used inverted encoding modelling to assess the fidelity of the neural representation of spatial location. We found longer interstimulus intervals and shorter stimulus durations produced the most reliable decoding. Varying interstimulus interval altered the fidelity of neural representations via inter-item interference. By contrast, the influence of stimulus duration seemed largely analytic; in a fixed duration block, shorter stimulus duration enabled more presentations, which led to increased decoding accuracy. Distinct anticipatory and reactionary neural events were observed for stimuli presented in triplet sequences, which seemed consistent with forwards and backwards visual masking. The absence of an anticipatory event was observed when backward masking was stronger while a reactionary event was present for every stimulus subjected to forward masking.",

      "content": "Developing peripheral blood-based diagnostic models for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), particularly those leveraging the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, has long been considered infeasible because patient-derived TCRs appear to lack convergent sequence motifs. We reasoned that this apparent absence of shared TCR features likely reflects both insufficient sample sizes and unaccounted immune heterogeneity within the iPD population. To overcome these barriers, we reconstructed TCR repertoires from the two largest iPD cohorts currently available and used three mechanistically distinct mouse models as etiologically informed anchors to molecularly stratify patients. Within these data-driven subtypes, we trained subtype-specific, multimodal multi-instance classifiers, achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.8 for both subtypes. Our findings underscore the critical role of disease stratification in enabling TCR repertoire-based modeling in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",
