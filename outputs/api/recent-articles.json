This is just for fun.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Existing rankings only rank combinations possible in the game (1 type or 2 types) but this analyzes the capabilities of type combinations that couldn't normally exist in-game (3 types to 18 types). </p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p> <p>I wrote a Python script with Pandas and Multiprocessing that analyzes all possible Pokemon type combinations and ranks them according to their offensive and defensive capabilities. It doesn't just do 1-2 types, but instead all combinations up to 18 types. This makes for 262,143 possible combinations in total!</p> <p><strong>Some highlights:</strong></p> <p>The best possible defensive combination is:</p> <pre><code>['Normal', 'Fire', 'Water', 'Electric', 'Poison', 'Ground', 'Flying', 'Ghost', 'Dragon', 'Dark', 'Steel', 'Fairy'] </code></pre> <p>This has no weaknesses.<br /> Resists Fire, Grass, Flying, Bug (0.03125x damage lol), Dark, Steel, and Fairy.<br /> Immune to Normal, Electric, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Psychic, and Ghost.<br /> This ranked 28th overall.</p> <p>That's only 12 types though. If a Pokemon had all 18 types, a.k.a:</p> <pre><code>['Normal', 'Fire', 'Water', 'Electric', 'Grass', 'Ice', 'Fighting', 'Poison', 'Ground', 'Flying', 'Psychic', 'Bug', 'Rock', 'Ghost', 'Dragon', 'Dark', 'Steel', 'Fairy'] </code></pre> <p>It would be weak to only Rock, but it would only resist Grass, Bug, Dark, and Steel.<br /> This ranked 1,992nd place in defense and 536th overall.</p> <p>The smallest number of types to hit all Pokemon for super effective STAB is 7. There were 10 7-type combinations that could hit all types for super effective damage. In total, 16,446 combinations could do this.</p> <p>The single worst defensive type combination is:</p> <pre><code>['Grass', 'Ice', 'Psychic', 'Bug', 'Dragon'] </code></pre> <p>Its weaknesses are</p> <pre><code>Fire: 4.0x Ice: 2.0x Poison: 2.0x Flying: 4.0x Bug: 4.0x Rock: 4.0x Ghost: 2.0x Dragon: 2.0x Dark: 2.0x Steel: 2.0x Fairy: 2.0x </code></pre> <p>Ouch. This combination placed 262,083rd overall.</p> <p>And the single lowest-scored type combination out of all 262,143 is... <em>Grass</em>. That's it. Pure Grass.</p> <p><strong>Looking at only 1-type and 2-type combinations:</strong></p> <p>Top 5 by Offense:</p> <pre><code>Rank 1: ['Ice', 'Ground'] 75.0% Highest for 2 types. Rank 2: ['Ice', 'Fighting'] 75.0% Highest for 2 types. Rank 3: ['Ground', 'Flying'] 72.22% Rank 4: ['Fire', 'Ground'] 72.22% Rank 5: ['Ground', 'Fairy'] 72.22% </code></pre> <p>Top 5 by Defense:</p> <pre><code>Rank 1: ['Flying', 'Steel'] 69.44% Highest for 2 types. Rank 2: ['Steel', 'Fairy'] 69.44% Highest for 2 types. Rank 3: ['Normal', 'Ghost'] 68.06% Rank 4: ['Bug', 'Steel'] 67.36% Rank 5: ['Ghost', 'Steel'] 67.36% </code></pre> <p>Top 5 Overall:</p> <pre><code>Rank 1: ['Ground', 'Flying'] # of Types: 2 Offense Score: 72.22% Defense Score: 63.19% Overall: 67.71% Highest average for 2 types. Rank 2: ['Fire', 'Ground'] # of Types: 2 Offense Score: 72.22% Defense Score: 62.5% Overall: 67.36% Rank 3: ['Ground', 'Steel'] # of Types: 2 Offense Score: 69.44% Defense Score: 64.58% Overall: 67.01% Rank 4: ['Ground', 'Fairy'] # of Types: 2 Offense Score: 72.22% Defense Score: 61.11% Overall: 66.67% Rank 5: ['Flying', 'Steel'] # of Types: 2 Offense Score: 63.89% Defense Score: 69.44% Highest defense for 2 types. Overall: 66.67% </code></pre> <p>The full code and output files up to 6-type combinations can be found on my Github, <a href=\"https://github.com/superwatts/pokemon-type-ranking/\">here.</a> </p> <p>The full output file for all 262,143 type combinations was almost 200MB in size, so I couldn't upload it to the GitHub, but the code is all there for anyone to run it themselves. Took about 7 minutes on my middling laptop, so if you have the space for the output files, you should be fine to run it.</p> <p>But yeah, hope this was entertaining! I put a solid 10-20 hours into it. Keep in mind it doesn't account for certain types being generally better or worse than others, but just the quantity of types themselves.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sxprwtts\"> /u/sxprwtts </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf56jo/python_script_ranking_all_262143_possible_pokemon/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf56jo/python_script_ranking_all_262143_possible_pokemon/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.
