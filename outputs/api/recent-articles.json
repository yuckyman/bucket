      "title": "Realistic adversarial scenario generation via human-like pedestrian model for autonomous vehicle control parameter optimisation",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.02082v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation.",

      "title": "Escaping the Filter Bubble: Evaluating Electroencephalographic Theta Band Synchronization as Indicator for Selective Exposure in Online News Reading",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.02047v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Selective exposure to online news occurs when users favor information that confirms their beliefs, creating filter bubbles and limiting diverse perspectives. Interactive systems can counter this by recommending different perspectives, but to achieve this, they need a real-time metric for selective exposure. We present an experiment where we evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking as indicators for selective exposure by using eye tracking to recognize which textual parts participants read and using EEG to quantify the magnitude of selective exposure. Participants read online news while we collected EEG and eye movements with their agreement towards the news. We show that the agreement with news correlates positively with the theta band power in the parietal area. Our results indicate that future interactive systems can sense selective exposure using EEG and eye tracking to propose a more balanced information diet. This work presents an integrated experimental setup that identifies selective exposure using gaze and EEG-based metrics.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.02044v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Existing eye tracking software have certain limitations, especially with respect to monitoring reading online: (1) Most eye tracking software record eye tracking data as raw coordinates and stimuli as screen images/videos, but without inherent links between both. Analysts must draw areas of interest (AOIs) on webpage text for more fine-grained reading analysis. (2) The computation and analysis of fixation and reading metrics are done after the experiment and thus cannot be used for live applications. We present EyeLiveMetrics, a browser plugin that automatically maps raw gaze coordinates to text in real time. The plugin instantly calculates, stores, and provides fixation, saccade, and reading measures on words and paragraphs so that gaze behavior can be analyzed immediately. We also discuss the results of a comparative evaluation. EyeLiveMetrics offers a flexible way to measure reading on the web - for research experiments and live applications.",

We present EdgeSSVEP, a fully embedded microcontroller-based Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI platform that performs real-time EEG acquisition, zero-phase filtering, and on-device classification within a lowpower 240 MHz MCU operating at only 222 mW. The system incorporates an 8-channel EEG front end, supports 5-second stimulus durations, and executes the entire SSVEP decoding pipeline locally, eliminating dependence on PC-based processing. EdgeSSVEP was evaluated using six stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 9, 11, 7.5, and 8.5 Hz) with 10 participants. The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients. Overall, EdgeSSVEP offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and secure embedded BCI platform suitable for assistive communication and neurofeedback applications, with potential extensions to accelerometer-based artifact mitigation and broader real-world deployments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01539v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current neural interfaces such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face several fundamental challenges, including frequent recalibration due to neuroplasticity and session-to-session variability, real-time processing latency, limited personalization and generalization across subjects, hardware constraints, surgical risks in invasive systems, and cognitive burden in patients with neurological impairments. These limitations significantly affect the accuracy, stability, and long-term usability of BCIs. This article introduces the concept of the Neural Digital Twin (NDT) as an advanced solution to overcome these barriers. NDT represents a dynamic, personalized computational model of the brain-BCI system that is continuously updated with real-time neural data, enabling prediction of brain states, optimization of control commands, and adaptive tuning of decoding algorithms. The design of NDT draws inspiration from the application of Digital Twin technology in advanced industries such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles, and leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience data acquisition technologies. In this work, we discuss the structure and implementation of NDT and explore its potential applications in next-generation BCIs and neural decoding, highlighting its ability to enhance precision, robustness, and individualized control in neurotechnology.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01247v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative yet double-edged technology that can advance human welfare while also posing risks to humans and society. In response, the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) approach has emerged as both a design philosophy and a methodological complement to prevailing technology-centered AI paradigms. Placing humans at the core, HCAI seeks to ensure that AI systems serve, augment, and empower humans rather than harm or replace them. This chapter establishes the conceptual and methodological foundations of HCAI by tracing its evolution and recent advancements. It introduces key HCAI concepts, frameworks, guiding principles, methodologies, and practical strategies that bridge philosophical HCAI principles with operational implementation. Through an analytical review of the emerging characteristics and challenges of AI technologies, the chapter positions HCAI as a holistic paradigm for aligning AI innovation with human values, societal well-being, and sustainable progress. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure and contributions of the Handbook of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an integrated foundation that connects HCAI conceptual frameworks, principles, methodology, and practices for this handbook, thereby paving the way for the content of subsequent chapters.",

To address this issue, this study examines the effectiveness of real-life scenario simulations integrated with interactive social robots in enhancing NCS student engagement and language acquisition. The research employs a quasi-experimental design involving NCS students who interact with an AI-driven, robot-assisted language learning system, LiveBo.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01218v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Creativity is increasingly recognized as an important skill in education, and storytelling can enhance motivation and engagement among students. However, conventional storytelling methods often lack the interactive elements necessary to engage students. To this end, this study examines the impact of an interactive digital storytelling system incorporating a human-like robot on student engagement and creativity. The study aims to compare engagement levels across three modalities: paper-based, PowerPoint, and robot-assisted storytelling, MotiBo. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, this work involves three groups of students who interact with the storytelling system over a five-day learning. Findings reveal that students using MotiBo exhibit statistically significant improvement in behavioural and cognitive engagement compared to those using traditional methods. These results suggest that the integration of novel technologies can effectively enhance the learning experience, ultimately promoting creativity and self-learning ability in educational settings. Future research will investigate the long-term effects of these technologies on learning outcomes and explore their potential for broader applications in diverse educational contexts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01094v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social cues, which convey others' presence, behaviors, or identities, play a crucial role in human information seeking by helping individuals judge relevance and trustworthiness. However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01027v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: From movie characters to modern science fiction - bringing characters into interactive, story-driven conversations has captured imaginations across generations. Achieving this vision is highly challenging and requires much more than just language modeling. It involves numerous complex AI challenges, such as conversational AI, maintaining character integrity, managing personality and emotions, handling knowledge and memory, synthesizing voice, generating animations, enabling real-world interactions, and integration with physical environments. Recent advancements in the development of foundation models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks have enabled researchers to address these individual challenges. However, combining these technologies for interactive characters remains an open problem. We present a system and platform for conveniently designing believable digital characters, enabling a conversational and story-driven experience while providing solutions to all of the technical challenges. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce Digital Einstein, which allows users to engage in conversations with a digital representation of Albert Einstein about his life, research, and persona. While Digital Einstein exemplifies our methods for a specific character, our system is flexible and generalizes to any story-driven or conversational character. By unifying these diverse AI components into a single, easy-to-adapt platform, our work paves the way for immersive character experiences, turning the dream of lifelike, story-based interactions into a reality.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20692v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",

Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.",

      "title": "Self-regulated emergence of heavy-tailed weight distributions in evolving complex network architectures",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.21445v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Synaptic plasticity typically produces heavy-tailed distributions of synaptic strengths, consisting of a few strong connections among many weaker ones. Meanwhile, structural plasticity relies on distinct signaling cascades to reshape network topology. We propose a model in which both types of plasticity adhere to the Hebbian principle while operating within homeostatically regulated activity. Synaptic plasticity alone generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, but only when any activity spreading beyond neighboring units is discarded. However, when combined with Hebbian structural plasticity, i.e., adaptive rewiring, heavy-tailed weight distributions also arise with more extensive activity flow. Furthermore, adaptive rewiring provides complex network structures with convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. Having adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring driven by the same homeostatic dynamics gives our model a parsimonious and robust framework that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes. Consequently, the model accounts for key connectivity structures in both C. elegans and the mouse, suggesting that its principles are shared across species of different complexities.",

      "title": "Unveiling the Heart-Brain Connection: An Analysis of ECG in Cognitive Performance",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.01424v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Understanding the interaction of neural and cardiac systems during cognitive activity is critical to advancing physiological computing. Although EEG has been the gold standard for assessing mental workload, its limited portability restricts its real-world use. Widely available ECG through wearable devices proposes a pragmatic alternative. This research investigates whether ECG signals can reliably reflect cognitive load and serve as proxies for EEG-based indicators. In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks. For each modality, we extracted ECG time-domain HRV metrics and Catch22 descriptors against EEG spectral and Catch22 features, respectively. We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG. Our results show that ECG-derived projections expressively capture variation in cognitive states and provide good support for accurate classification. Our findings underpin ECG as an interpretable, real-time, wearable solution for everyday cognitive monitoring.",

      "title": "Responses of the Neurobiological Craving Signature to smoking versus alternative social rewards predict craving and monthly smoking in adolescents",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.02143v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.02063v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: How much of the brain's learned algorithms depend on the fact it is a brain? We argue: a lot, but surprisingly few details matter. We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like' algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.02010v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A remarkable capability of the human brain is to form more abstract conceptual representations from sensorimotor experiences and flexibly apply them independent of direct sensory inputs. However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.01782v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: How neural representations in the insular cortex support emotional processing remains poorly understood, and the extent to which the insula is specialized for disgust processing remains debated. We recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the insula while human subjects with implanted electrode contacts performed a facial emotion recognition task involving disgusted, fearful, angry, sad, neutral, and happy expressions. Expression category specificity of insular activity was assessed via pairwise comparisons of within- and between-category pattern similarities, capturing both the shape and scale of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; theta to high-gamma frequency ranges). Insular activity successfully identified all investigated expressions, mediated by diverse ERP responses intermixed across the insula. In contrast to the marked heterogeneity of insula ERP responses, the fusiform face area exhibited convergent ERP responses across expressions and contacts, with ERSPs also contributing substantially to expression identification. These findings not only elucidate the insula's neural mechanisms underlying facial emotion perception, but also establish a potential single-contact-level neural substrate for how the insula leverages its heterogeneous response profiles to act as a key hub for versatile cognitive and emotional functions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.00984v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Krotov and Hopfield (2021) proposed a biologically plausible two-layer associative memory network with memory storage capacity exponential in the number of visible neurons. However, the capacity was only linear in the number of hidden neurons. This limitation arose from the choice of nonlinearity between the visible and hidden units, which enforced winner-takes-all dynamics in the hidden layer, thereby restricting each hidden unit to encode only a single memory. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel associative memory network with a threshold nonlinearity that enables distributed representations. In contrast to winner-takes-all dynamics, where each hidden neuron is tied to an entire memory, our network allows hidden neurons to encode basic components shared across many memories. Consequently, complex patterns are represented through combinations of hidden neurons. These representations reduce redundancy and allow many correlated memories to be stored compositionally. Thus, we achieve much higher capacity: exponential in the number of hidden units, provided the number of visible units is sufficiently larger than the number of hidden neurons. Exponential capacity arises because all binary states of the hidden units can become stable memory patterns with an appropriately chosen threshold. Moreover, the distributed hidden representation, which has much lower dimensionality than the visible layer, preserves class-discriminative structure, supporting efficient nonlinear decoding. These results establish a new regime for associative memory, enabling high-capacity, robust, and scalable architectures consistent with biological constraints.",
