      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Visual representations in the human brain rely on a reference frame that is in between allocentric and retinocentric coordinates",
      "content": "Visual information in our everyday environment is anchored to an allocentric reference frame - a tall building remains upright even when you tilt your head, which changes the projection of the building on your retina from a vertical to a diagonal orientation. Does retinotopic cortex represent visual information in an allocentric or retinocentric reference frame? Here, we investigate which reference frame the brain uses by dissociating allocentric and retinocentric reference frames via a head tilt manipulation combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen participants completed between 1728-2880 trials during which they briefly viewed (150 ms) and then remembered (1500 ms) a randomly oriented target grating. In interleaved blocks of trials, the participant's head was either kept upright, or tilted by 45 degee using a custom rotating chinrest. The target orientation could be decoded throughout the trial (using both voltage and alpha-band signals) when training and testing within head-upright blocks, and within head-tilted blocks. Importantly, we directly addressed the question of reference frames via cross-generalized decoding: If target orientations are represented in a retinocentric reference frame, a decoder trained on head-upright trials would predict a 45 degree offset in decoded orientation when tested on head-tilted trials (after all, a vertical building becomes diagonal on the retina after head tilt). Conversely, if target representations are allocentric and anchored to the real world, no such offset should be observed. Our analyses reveal that from the earliest stages of perceptual processing all the way throughout the delay, orientations are represented in between an allocentric and retinocentric reference frame. These results align with previous findings from physiology studies in non-human primates, and are the first to demonstrate that the human brain does not rely on a purely allocentric or retinocentric reference frame when representing visual information.",

      "title": "Multi-Class Classification of Cannabis and Alcohol Use Disorder: Identifying Common and Substance-Specific Neural Circuits.",
      "content": "Machine learning approaches have advanced the identification of neural signatures of substance use, particularly through case-control comparisons and network-level analyses. However, most studies have focused on single substances in isolation, making it difficult to directly compare shared and distinct network computations and limiting their generalizability, given that many individuals engage in polysubstance use. Here, we introduce an explainable, connectivity-based multiclass classification framework that models distributed brain network organization to delineate both shared and substance-specific mechanisms of addiction. This design enables direct comparison among cannabis users, alcohol users, and controls, revealing network computations that uniquely differentiate each group. Using functional connectivity features from cue-induced craving tasks, we classified cannabis users (n=166), alcohol users (n=101), and healthy controls (n=238), achieving high out-of-sample accuracy (87% for cannabis, 69% for alcohol, and 73% for controls). Functional connectivity-based models consistently outperformed activation-based models, highlighting the importance of inter-regional network properties for biomarker development. Network analysis further revealed dorsal prefrontal, cingulate, and precuneus hubs consistent with meta-analytic craving networks and substance-specific connectivity motifs enhanced prefrontal coupling in cannabis users and greater insular-striatal integration in alcohol users. These results demonstrate that distinct network configurations define different substance-use profiles, advancing interpretable biomarkers for addiction neuroscience.",

      "title": "Influence of STDP rule choice and network connectivity on polychronous groups and cell ensembles in spiking neural networks",
      "content": "Spike-timing dependent plasticity plays an important role in how biological neural networks modify themselves with experience. However, the relationship between STDP and memory is not fully understood. Previously, an important advancement in understanding the relationship between spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and memory was made through cortical simulations. The proposed memory items, polychronous groups (PGs), combined the network anatomy with precise spike-timing relationships between the connected cells of the network. However, there are some challenges with this previous work. It is unclear how different STDP rules would impact the PG results and if the PG results are complementary with purely spike-pattern defined memory items called cell ensembles (CEs). Lastly, it is unclear how these results are affected by changes in network connectivity. We address these challenges by comparing the PGs and CEs detected in spiking neural network simulations of cortical and hippocampal CA1 networks with two different STDP rule implementations. We show that the PG and CE results differ greatly for the two different STDP rules and for the cortical and CA1 networks. Our results show an important disconnect between anatomically defined and spike-pattern defined memories in spiking neural network simulations illustrating that care must be taken when drawing conclusions on the relationship between STDP and memory in simulation studies.",

      "title": "Protracted fate acquisition and epigenetic de-aging during induced neural stem cell conversion of human blood cells",
      "content": "Transcription factor-based direct conversion of somatic cells represents an interesting avenue for generating induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) from peripheral blood without transit through a pluripotent stage. While this paradigm has been shown to be associated with epigenetic de-aging, the dynamics of this process have remained unclear. Here, we used overexpression of the two reprogramming factors SOX2 and cMYC to generate iNSC from erythroid progenitors of donors ranging from neonatal to 101 years of age. Using an epigenetic clock algorithm, we corroborated our previous finding that iNSCs generated from aged donors show pronounced epigenetic de-aging, preserving around 13 % and 5 % of the original donor age at low and high passages, respectively. Studying the dynamic of epigenetic de-aging during iNSC conversion across time, we found that this process is largely protracted, continuing for several weeks and even beyond forced neuronal differentiation of iNSCs. Transcriptomic differences between young and old donor-derived iNSCs dissipate with extended time in conversion, too. Concordant with this observation, established iNSC lines lack age-associated cellular hallmarks, similar to induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. Interestingly, time course analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data revealed that acquisition of a bona fide NSC signature extends greatly beyond the time point when proliferative PAX6-positive iNSCs emerge. The unexpected slow dynamics of these processes makes iNSC conversion an attractive model for dissecting the mechanisms underlying somatic transdifferentiation and de-aging.",

      "title": "VDAC activation inhibits hippocampal plasticity via NLRP3 inflammasome & caspase-1: modulation by allopregnanolone enantiomers",
      "content": "Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are the most abundant proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and key regulators of mitochondrial function under physiological and pathological conditions. These channels are modulated by multiple agents and are known binding sites for neuroactive steroids (NAS) including allopregnanolone (AlloP). Using erastin, an agent that promotes VDAC activation by preventing inhibition by tubulin, we assessed the impact of VDAC activation on hippocampal function. Brief erastin administration had no effect on basal transmission but completely inhibited induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of rat hippocampal slices. This LTP inhibition was prevented by VBIT-4, an agent that inhibits VDAC oligomerization. VDAC-mediated LTP inhibition was also prevented by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, downstream effectors of VDACs, but not by inhibition of cGAS-STING, narrowing the neuroinflammatory pathways involved. Similarly, effects of erastin were prevented by AlloP and at lower concentrations by its unnatural enantiomer (ent-AlloP), an agent that unlike AlloP has little effect on GABAA receptors. Erastin also inhibited memory formation in a hippocampal-dependent form of one-trial learning and these effects were prevented by VBIT-4 and ent-AlloP, but not by a non-sedating dose of AlloP. These results have relevance for understanding the role of VDACs as mediators of neuronal stress and for the further development of NAS as neurotherapeutics and modulators of cellular stress.",

      "title": "Relative-location tuning in five frontal areas in a rhesus monkey",
      "content": "Primates exhibit remarkable flexibility in coordinating gaze angle, spatial attention, and motor goals, such as fixating on one point, attending to another, and planning a reach toward a third. Neuronal reference frames are critical for these behaviors. We investigated relative-location tuning in macaque monkeys, where the reference frame was defined by the relative positions of two objects in a scene rather than their absolute coordinates. Single neurons were recorded from five frontal cortex regions: dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), supplementary motor area (SMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFdl), and frontal eye field (FEF). In each trial, the monkey viewed two food pellets, one in a stationary feeder and another in a feeder attached to a moving robot, which served as an attention attractor. By task rule, the monkey could obtain only one pellet. A significant proportion of neurons in all five regions showed spatial tuning based on the relative positions of the two feeders (~35-65%, depending on the area). For instance, some neurons were more active when one feeder was positioned to the right of the other. In PFdl and FEF, most relative-location neurons primarily encoded the monkey fixation on the relatively left or right feeder. In SMA, PMd, and PMv, some neurons reflected fixation, but more encoded whether the relatively left or right feeder was the attention attractor (independent of gaze) or the reach target. Relative-location tuning was more prevalent when both feeders were task-relevant, such as when the monkey attended to one feeder while planning a reach to the other. Relative-location neurons could contribute to computing object-based reference frames or allocating spatial information-processing resources across attentional, oculomotor, and skeletomotor behaviors. They also suffice to explain gaze-dependent reach-related activity without contradicting theories of visually guided reaching, which predict gaze invariance.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Intersections between heritage, multilingualism, and education: language acquisition in India",
      "content": "India is a profoundly diverse nation-state where constitutional provisions for two official and 22 Scheduled languages overlay a vast substratum of numerous Non-Scheduled languages and over a thousand distinct mother tongues, creating a rich and layered linguistic hierarchy. The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1. We also find that the understanding of \u201cheritage language\u201d needs to be more nuanced in this particular context of multilingualism and language acquisition.",

      "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
      "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",
