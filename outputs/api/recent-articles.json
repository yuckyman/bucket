      "title": "Repetition Coherence Reveals Computational Principles of Auditory Object Formation",
      "content": "Repetition is a powerful cue for auditory object formation. In natural environments, however, repetitions are rarely exact copies of sound sequences and often overlap with competing sounds. To characterise the temporal integration dynamics and the evidence required for perceptual organisation of acoustic scenes into objects, we developed a repetition-coherence framework inspired by motion-coherence paradigms in vision. Participants listened to dense tone-cloud sequences in which a subset of tones repeated across cycles, with the proportion of repeating tones indicating coherence. Across two psychophysical tasks (repetition detection and sensorimotor synchronization), repetition coherence had strikingly similar effects: it shaped both the likelihood of object formation and the consistency of subsequent tracking. At high coherence, the emergence of the object and the attainment of a stable tracking phase occurred at the same number of cycles. The behavioural trajectory of synchronization performance, used to infer the dynamics of temporal integration, parallels prior neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, establishing a link between perception and neurophysiology. Moreover, we observed threshold shifts due to unit duration in the detection task, which indicates a dissociation between the effect of temporal scale on the likelihood and timing of object emergence: longer units when repeated reduced detection probability, but emergence timing remained constant. These findings demonstrate convergent behavioural dynamics shaped by bottom-up regularities, while intrinsic temporal integration windows constrain the process differently according to task demands. Overall, repetition coherence provides a principled framework for probing the processes underpinning auditory object formation, revealing common behavioural signatures alongside distinct sensitivities to temporal scale.",

      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

      "content": "This study examined whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep mentation provides more pertinent material for dream interpretation compared to non-REM (NREM) sleep mentation. Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.
