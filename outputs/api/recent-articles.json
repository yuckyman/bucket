      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "content": "Neural oscillations have long been used to characterize the temporal dynamics of individual brain regions, yet a parsimonious, system level representation that integrates multi rhythmic activity has been lacking. Using source localized resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we computed regional power spectra and assessed spectral similarity, then applied diffusion map embedding to construct cross frequency neurophysiological gradients that place whole brain oscillations within a unified, low dimensional coordinate system. We found the first three gradients accounted for over 40% of the variance, remained stable across individuals, and aligned with established functional, structural, and geometric cortical axes. Computational modeling showed that these gradients reflect local excitation inhibition balance, while multimodal analyses revealed strong associations with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, cytoarchitecture, and cell type specific gene expression. Lifespan analyses further demonstrated systematic gradient reorganization, with distinct cognitive mappings onto functions such as language, memory, and multisensory integration. Clinically, Parkinson's disease patients displayed disrupted gradients, particularly in regions linked to language and social cognition. Finally, these gradient patterns exhibited high test retest reliability. These findings establish MEG derived neurophysiological gradients as robust, low dimensional representations of cortical organization, offering a biologically grounded framework for studying brain aging and disease.",

      "title": "Short-term microglia depletion via CSF-1R inhibition promotes functional network reorganization and motor recovery after cortical ischemia",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacological options to promote long-term rehabilitation after stroke remain limited. Microglia play a complex role in post-stroke pathology, contributing both to repair and secondary injury. How short-term depletion during the subacute phase affects functional recovery remains unknown. METHODS: Wild-type mice were trained in a skilled reaching task and underwent permanent distal medial cerebral artery occlusion or sham intervention. Mice received either a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor or vehicle treatment between days 3 and 7 post-stroke to deplete microglia. Fine motor performance was assessed behaviorally while bilateral cortical activity was recorded longitudinally through epidural electrocorticography. RESULTS: Microglia depletion did not affect infarct size but resulted in near-complete restoration of fine motor function by day 7, coinciding with maximal microglial depletion. Recovery of fine motor function was accompanied by significant functional connectivity changes in bilateral sensorimotor networks, including increased beta-band connectivity in the ipsilesional motor cortex, which correlated with contralateral fine motor improvement. After microglial repopulation, cells showed altered morphology and gene expression profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Transient microglial modulation during the subacute phase after stroke promotes cortical network reorganization and motor recovery, highlighting a potential time window for future translational studies.",

      "title": "Peripheral Nerve Transection Predominantly Drives Sympathetic Nerve Sprouting in Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglia",
      "content": "Sympathetic sprouting in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) is a feature of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) following peripheral nerve injury, yet the factors determining its occurrence remain unclear. Here, we compare transection and crush injury models to determine if injury type or site influence sympathetic remodeling and pain. Using TH-IR immunostaining and Phox2b reporter mice to selectively label sympathetic fibers, we found that an L5 spinal nerve transection (SpNT) triggered robust sympathetic fiber sprouting and elevated norepinephrine (NE) levels in the DRG, correlating with a mechanical hypersensitivity reversed by chemical sympathectomy. In contrast, a partial sciatic nerve crush injury (PCI) produced long-lasting mechanical hypersensitivity without sympathetic sprouting or NE elevation and was unaffected by sympathectomy. Importantly, sympathetic sprouting was consistently more pronounced after transection injuries at both spinal and sciatic nerve sites, suggesting that injury type, rather than location, is a dominant factor shaping sympathetic remodeling. These findings establish nerve transection as a key driver of sympathetic sprouting and SMP, whereas crush-induced pain likely involves distinct non-sympathetic mechanisms. This distinction has important implications for pain subtype identification and treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Investigating the Role of Exosome-associated Human Endogenous Retroviruses as Biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease",
      "content": "Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV K) reactivation is increasingly implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with ongoing clinical trials investigating antiretroviral therapies. However, there is a limited understanding of how HERV-K is trafficked in peripheral biofluids, and the role of exosomes, which are nano sized extracellular vesicles, in this process remains largely unexplored. Exosomes offer a stable and cell-specific cargo reservoir that may reflect central pathogenic processes and serve as a minimally invasive biomarker source. In this study, we isolated plasma-derived exosomes from ALS patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 16), and quantified exosomal HERV-K gag, env, and pol transcript levels using SYBR Green qPCR with RNase treatment and normalization to both traditional and exosome enriched reference genes. HERV K pol expression was significantly elevated in ALS, with fold-changes ranging from 1.59 to 1.85 (P = 0.037 to 0.051). env and gag also showed increased expression, though with greater variability. Normalization to the exosome-specific gene SOD2 provided the most consistent signal. A trend toward higher pol expression in bulbar-onset ALS was observed. These findings suggest that exosomal HERV-K transcripts, particularly pol, could serve as accessible biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment monitoring in HERV K targeted ALS trials. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for using exosomal cargo to track endogenous retroviral activity in neurodegeneration, supporting further investigation of liquid biopsy approaches in ALS precision medicine.",

      "title": "A Distinct Subpopulation of Extended Amygdala Neurons Drives Food Intake",
      "content": "Background: Neurons in the oval subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) integrate stress and reward signals to regulate motivated behaviors, including food consumption. However, the contribution of specific ovBNST neuronal subpopulations remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) expressing ovBNST neurons using chemogenetics, immunohistochemistry, and viral circuit mapping. Methods and Results: Using stimulatory hM3Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we found that chemogenetic activation of ovBNST Vipr2 neurons significantly increased food intake. We then quantified cFos activation in Vipr2-tdTomato reporter mice following several unique feeding-related manipulations, finding that food restriction (FR) robustly activated ovBNST Vipr2 neurons. Further analysis revealed decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) innervation of the ovBNST following FR, in which reduced VIP expression was significantly associated with greater ovBNST Vipr2 cFos activation. Given previous reports of reduced food intake following stimulation of ovBNST neurons expressing protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}), we used immunostaining to uncover that Vipr2 and PKC{delta} mark largely non-overlapping ovBNST neuronal subpopulations, aligning with their opposing effects on food intake. Finally, Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing revealed that ovBNST Vipr2 neurons project prominently to the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), two feeding-related regions. Conclusions: Together, these results identify ovBNST Vipr2 neurons as a functionally distinct BNST subpopulation that promotes feeding, is activated by food restriction, and links ovBNST neuropeptide signaling to hypothalamic feeding centers.",

Large, publicly available neural and behavioural datasets can enable new discoveries and targeted hypothesis tests, yet no such datasets are currently available. We present the FOODEEG dataset containing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to a diverse array of food images, as well as behavioural measures of food cognition (food categorisation task, food go/no-go task, and food choice task responses), collected from 117 participants. We also provide normative ratings for the food image stimuli with respect to 22 food attributes, including nutritive, hedonic and taste properties, familiarity, and elicited emotions. Our dataset also includes questionnaire-based measures of participants' food motivations, dietary styles, and general motivational tendencies. In the validation analyses, we demonstrate that early food-evoked EEG responses in our dataset are consistent with observations in previous work. The FOODEEG dataset will be valuable for accelerating research into the neural substrates of visual food processing, dietary decisions, and individual differences.",

      "title": "Ipsilateral transfer of motor skill from upper to lower limb in healthy adults: a randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "Intermanual transfer refers to the improvement of motor skill in an untrained contralateral limb following unilateral limb practice. However, it remains uncertain whether motor skill in the lower limb (LL) can improve as a result of practice with the unilateral upper limb (UL). Forty-five healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) UL group, which practiced reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left upper limb; or (2) switches observation (SO) group, which observed the same RM sequences; or (3) nature observation (NO) group, which observed nature movies. RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "Multitarget neurostimulation of the deep brain: clinical opportunities, challenges, and emerging technologies",
      "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",
