      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "An algorithmic procedure for measuring deep brain stimulation-induced capsular activation using motor evoked potentials",
      "content": "Objective. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of surgical targeting and DBS programming.",

      "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",

      "title": "Temporal properties of direct current sensory block of the rat sciatic nerve using the C-fiber reflex",
      "content": "Objective. Direct current (DC) electrical block of peripheral sensory axons has potential for clinical applications in pain management. The C-fiber reflex (CFR), elicited via noxious stimulation of the foot, is suitable for investigating the activation of unmyelinated C-fiber nerves, the fiber class that is responsible for lingering pain sensations. Approach. In anesthetized rats, the CFR was elicited via electrical stimulation to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and the resulting C-fiber-evoked electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the ipsilateral biceps femoris muscle. A carbon separated interface nerve electrode was used to deliver DC block to arrest action potentials in the sciatic nerve. The efficacy of the block was observed as a reduction/abolition of the magnitude of the EMG in a time window corresponding to the latency of C-fibers activity. Main results. Complete cessation of nerve activity could be achieved instantaneously by applying DC at the \u2018block threshold (BT)\u2019. At amplitudes below the BT, complete block could be induced over a period of seconds to minutes, with lower currents being correlated with longer induction times. When block was applied for prolonged periods of time, block was sustained following the cessation of DC delivery. This \u2018recovery period\u2019 was longer for longer durations of block application. Significance. The CFR is an established method to investigate pharmaceutical pain therapies, yet to date, has not been used to assess electrical block of sensory axons. Therefore, anatomical and electrophysiological methods were used to validate this method. DC nerve block shows promise for clinical pain management applications. Furthermore, the temporal properties described here could be used to reduce overall electrical current delivery and improve safety.",

      "title": "Dynamic graph representation of EEG signals for speech imagery recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Speech imagery recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an emerging challenge in brain-computer interfaces, and has important applications, such as in the interaction with locked-in patients. In this work, we use graph signal processing for developing a more effective representation of EEG signals in speech imagery recognition. Approach. We propose a dynamic graph representation that uses multiple graphs constructed based on the time-varying correlations between EEG channels. Our methodology is particularly suitable for signals that exhibit fluctuating correlations, which cannot be adequately modeled through a static (single graph) model. The resultant representation provides graph frequency features that compactly capture the spatial patterns of the underlying multidimensional EEG signal as well as the evolution of spatial relationships over time. These dynamic graph features are fed into an attention-based long short-term memory network for speech imagery recognition. A novel EEG data augmentation method is also proposed for improving training robustness. Main results. Experimental evaluation using a range of experiments shows that the proposed dynamic graph features are more effective than conventional time-frequency features for speech imagery recognition. The overall system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, yielding accuracy gains of up to 10%. Significance. The dynamic graph representation captures time-varying spatial relationships in EEG signals, overcoming limitations of static graph models and conventional feature extraction. Combined with data augmentation and attention-based classification, it demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in speech imagery recognition.",

      "content": "Objective. Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

      "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
      "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

      "content": "Pyramidal cells (PCs) of hippocampal area CA2 exhibit increased excitability in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in mouse models of TLE. In epileptic mice, selective inhibition of CA2 PCs reduces chronic seizures. Here we asked if activating CA2 PCs increases seizures. Mice expressing Cre recombinase in CA2 PCs (Amigo2-Cre mice) were injected with the convulsant pilocarpine to induce a period of severe seizures (status epilepticus, SE), which leads to chronic seizures after 3-4 weeks (epilepsy). Epileptic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (eDREADD; hM3Dq) in dorsal CA2 bilaterally and implanted with subdural EEG electrodes. After recovery, mice were recorded continuously using video and EEG for 6 weeks, 3 weeks with drinking water containing the eDREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 3 weeks without CNO. CA2 activation with CNO caused a significant increase in seizure frequency and duration. Seizures occurred in clusters (many seizures per day over several consecutive days) and mice given water with CNO had a greater maximum number of seizures per day during a cluster compared to water without CNO. CNO had no significant effect in control mice. In naive Amigo2-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq, pre-treatment with CNO before pilocarpine administration shortened the latency to SE and increased EEG power at the start of SE. Taken together with prior findings, the results suggest that CA2 is a control point for regulating seizures in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE.",
