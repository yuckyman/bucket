      "title": "Reevaluating the classification of pediatric speech sound disorders: a ground truthing perspective",
      "content": "Pediatric Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs) are conventionally diagnosed using auditory-perceptual assessments, heavily relying on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions. This approach, while prevalent, is increasingly criticized due to inherent perceptual biases, limited sensitivity to subtle speech motor variations, and insufficient reflection of underlying speech mechanisms. This paper critically re-examines a widely used diagnostic classification system for pediatric SSDs, namely Dodd\u2019s Model of Differential Diagnosis (MDD), emphasizing the limitations of perceptual methods and advocating for instrumental techniques to address significant ground truthing issues. Critical analysis in this paper integrates evidence from perceptual research, instrumental phonetics, and speech motor development studies, highlighting discrepancies between traditional classification methods and modern instrumental data. Findings indicate profound limitations in current auditory-perceptual classification methods, particularly regarding their inability to detect subtle motoric impairments such as jaw sliding, covert motor contrasts, and undifferentiated tongue gestures. Evidence from instrumental studies supports a speech-motor rather than purely cognitive-linguistic basis for many pediatric SSDs, revealing significant inadequacies in current clinical practices. To avoid the narrow interpretation of \u201cmotor speech\u201d as referring only to childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or dysarthria, we explicitly broaden its scope to include a wider range of motoric influences on SSDs. Given these critical ground truthing concerns, the paper proposes adopting instrumental-based methodologies that offer greater precision in identifying underlying motor-based impairments, thereby promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of pediatric SSDs. Furthermore, the discussion advocates for adopting a dimensional rather than categorical classification framework, emphasizing gradual developmental trajectories and foundational speech motor skills. Aligning with modern precision medicine principles, the proposed approach aims to refine diagnostic accuracy, improve intervention effectiveness, and ultimately enhance clinical outcomes for children with SSDs.",

      "content": "Due to the intricate dynamic coupling between molecular networks and brain regions, early diagnosis and pathological mechanism analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain highly challenging. To address this, we propose a graph convolutional neural network framework (DEG-BRIN-GCN) based on a differentially expressed gene-brain region interaction network (DEG-BRIN), aiming to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and biological interpretability in AD research. We began by systematically analyzing transcriptomic data from 19 brain regions, identifying 329 differentially expressed genes that display widespread co-expression across multiple regions. Using these findings, we constructed DEG-BRIN to model prior associations among genes, thereby revealing potential molecular connectivity patterns implicated in AD pathological progression. Leveraging this network prior, we developed an AD classification model based on graph convolutional networks. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our proposed DEG-BRIN-GCN achieves significantly better diagnostic performance than three categories of baseline models: traditional machine learning methods, Random-GCN (models based on random network topologies), and PPI-GCN. Further analysis identified key brain regions\u2013such as the superior parietal lobule, putamen, and frontal pole\u2013along with high-contribution genes, including VCAM1, MCTP1, HBB, and CX3CR1, which play critical roles in AD pathology. Notably, this study is the first to implement a interpretability analysis based on a \u201cgene-region-pathway\u201d triad, offering a novel framework for cross-scale exploration of AD pathological mechanisms. Our findings underscore the central importance of inter-regional molecular interaction networks in the accurate diagnosis of AD.",

      "title": "KCNK18 c.1107del frameshift in peripheral neuropathy links TRESK dysfunction to neuropathic pain",
      "content": "Neuropathic pain is commonly accompanied by hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, which is driven by regulation of several ion channels, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) that stabilize the resting membrane potential. The TWIK-Related Spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, K2p18.1) is predominantly expressed in sensory ganglia, where it provides major background K+ conductance. We describe a heterozygous c.1107del frameshift mutation in KCNK18, encoding TRESK, found in a patient with painful small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia. This C-terminal c.1107del mutant is predicted to generate an elongated C-terminal domain, with an altered protein sequence. Whole-cell patch calmp recordings showed that the c.1107del variant reduced K+ current density, while heterozygous-like expression resulted in intermediate currents, consistent with a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Confocal imaging revealed decreased plasma membrane expression, indicating a trafficking-dependent loss of function while oligomerization with TRESK (homomeric channels) or TREK1 remained intact. In silico analysis revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern and reduced C-terminal hydrophobicity in the mutant TRESK. Overall, these findings support c.1107del as a pathogenic KCNK18 variant causing TRESK haploinsufficiency, offering mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

      "title": "Mechanism study of exercise intervention on circadian disruption in Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) induces profound circadian disruption\u2014characterized by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) degeneration, A\u03b2 and tau pathology, and aberrant melatonin secretion which results in fragmented sleep\u2013wake cycles and cognitive decline. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise significantly ameliorates these circadian rhythm and sleep\u2013wake disturbances through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, exercise accelerates the removal of A\u03b2 and tau by activating autophagy\u2013lysosomal degradation and glymphatic clearance, thereby reducing the neuropathological burden. Furthermore, exercise also upregulates neuroprotective pathways and strengthens the amplitude and phase stability of core clock gene oscillations, which in turn restores robust melatonin rhythmicity and SCN function. Collectively, these effects break the vicious cycle between AD pathology and circadian disruption, stabilizing circadian homeostasis and improving cognitive function. These mechanistic insights highlight exercise as a robust non-pharmacological chronotherapeutic strategy for ameliorating circadian disruption in AD. These insights support the development of personalized, chronotype-tailored exercise interventions to resynchronize circadian rhythms and ultimately improve sleep quality and cognitive function in patients with AD.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08942v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Junior indie game developers in distributed, part-time teams lack production frameworks suited to their specific context, as traditional methodologies are often inaccessible. This study introduces the CIGDI (Co-Intelligence Game Development Ideation) Framework, an alternative approach for integrating AI tools to address persistent challenges of technical debt, coordination, and burnout.\n  The framework emerged from a three-month reflective practice and autoethnographic study of a three-person distributed team developing the 2D narrative game \"The Worm's Memoirs\". Based on analysis of development data (N=157 Jira tasks, N=333 GitHub commits, N=13+ Miro boards, N=8 reflection sessions), CIGDI is proposed as a seven-stage iterative process structured around human-in-the-loop decision points (Priority Criteria and Timeboxing).\n  While AI support democratized knowledge access and reduced cognitive load, our analysis identified a significant challenge: \"comprehension debt.\" We define this as a novel form of technical debt where AI helps teams build systems more sophisticated than their independent skill level can create or maintain. This paradox (possessing functional systems the team incompletely understands) creates fragility and AI dependency, distinct from traditional code quality debt.\n  This work contributes a practical production framework for resource-constrained teams and identifies critical questions about whether AI assistance constitutes a learning ladder or a dependency trap for developer skill.",

The framework enables real-time, personalized urban evaluation based on individual priorities and lifestyle requirements. The methodology employs grid-based discretization and a two-stage computational architecture that separates intensive preprocessing from lightweight real-time calculations. The computational architecture demonstrates that accessibility modelling can be made accessible to non-technical users through interactive interfaces, enabling fine-grained spatial analysis and identification of accessibility variations within neighbourhoods. The research contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 11's vision of inclusive, sustainable cities by providing tools for understanding how different populations experience identical urban spaces, supporting evidence-based policy development that addresses accessibility gaps.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08939v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Serving as an emerging and powerful tool, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Human Digital Twins are showing great potential in healthcare system research. However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.",
