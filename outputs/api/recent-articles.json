      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "content": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major public health problem caused by damage to cochlear hair cells, synapses, and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Since effective treatments are lacking, we investigated cellular stress responses induced by moderate and loud noise in a mouse model of cochlear synaptopathy. RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed that noise exposure elicited a robust but transient upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and proteasome subunits in SGNs and their supporting cells. To target this response, we administered TRC051384, a small molecule activator of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1, prior to noise exposure. TRC051384 crossed the blood labyrinth barrier and reached the cochlea, induced heat shock protein gene expression, and restored ubiquitin proteasome function in SGNs. Notably, TRC051384 treatment enhanced auditory brainstem response threshold recovery, preserved Wave I amplitudes, and maintained ribbon synapse density. These findings establish proteotoxic stress in SGNs as a key driver of NIHL and identify HSF1 activation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",
