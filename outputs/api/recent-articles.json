      "title": "Rehabilitation of patients in the subacute phase of stroke using the ReHand robotic system: a randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "BackgroundUpper limb motor impairment after stroke is a major cause of limitations in daily activities and reduced quality of life. Although traditional rehabilitation is effective, it is often insufficiently intensive and lacks focus on fine motor activation. Portable soft exoskeletons offer a promising approach to intensify recovery. This trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ReHand robotic system in subacute stroke rehabilitation.MethodsThis Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) included 120 patients in the subacute period of stroke. Participants were stratified by age and motor deficit severity and randomized into the intervention group (robotic therapy + standard therapy) or control group (standard therapy only). The intervention was delivered 5 times per week over 8\u202fweeks. The primary outcome was change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE); secondary outcomes included Barthel Index (BI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Wolf Motor Function Test (mWMFT), Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis was performed in Python (v3.11). Normality was assessed with the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test; the Mann\u2013Whitney test was used for intergroup comparisons; Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test with Yates\u2019 correction was used for categorical variables. Effect size was calculated using Cliff\u2019s delta; rank-ANCOVA was performed via the Quade method. Significance was set at p\u202f<\u202f0.05.ResultsThe intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in upper limb motor impairment compared to the control group, as reflected by larger gains in FMA-UE scores. Clinically meaningful improvements (\u22655.25 points) were observed in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group versus 43.3% in the control group. All secondary outcomes also showed significant improvements in the intervention group (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.ConclusionWhen combined with standard therapy, the ReHand robotic system may enhance upper limb recovery after stroke and appears to be a safe and feasible adjunct to multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, identifier (NCT06937346).",

      "title": "Exploring the link between emotional states and coding task quality: a pilot study",
      "content": "Emotions play a crucial role in shaping cognitive performance, yet their influence on programing remains understudied. This pilot study investigates the relationship between emotional states and coding task quality. Ten participants completed a programing task while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), with frontal alpha asymmetry (FAI) applied as a neural marker of emotional valence. Emotional self-reports were collected using the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), and coding quality was evaluated through a structured rubric. Preliminary findings indicate a potential association between FAI and coding performance, whereas self-reported affect showed weaker or inconsistent patterns. Given the small sample size (n = 10), these results should be interpreted as exploratory. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating EEG-based emotional measures into software engineering research and lays the groundwork for larger-scale investigations into how emotions influence coding task quality.",

      "title": "Disruption of global brain network topology in amnestic MCI: evidence from multimodal DTI and fMRI",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study aims to utilize multimodal neuroimaging techniques to simultaneously analyze global topological properties of white matter structural networks and resting-state functional networks in aMCI patients, comparing them with healthy controls. By conducting independent and integrative analyses of topological impairments in both networks, we seek to systematically characterize the multimodal network disruption patterns in aMCI.Methods45 aMCI patients and 42 healthy adults from the First Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, were enrolled. A case-control cross-sectional study was conducted. DTI and rs-fMRI data were collected for all participants. Global topological properties of structural and functional networks were constructed using PANDA and dpabi software and were calculated via graph-theoretical analysis in GRETNA software, followed by statistical comparisons between groups.ResultsIn patients with aMCI, the small-world (Cp, aCp, Lambda, aLambda) of the WM structural network were significantly higher than those in the HC group; Rich-club nodes showed redistribution, and the Rich-club coefficient was decreased; aEloc was significantly increased; the Assortativity index (r < 0) indicated disassortativity; the Hierarchy index (b > 0) exhibited a significant decrease in b within the sparsity range of 0.39\u223c0.4; the synchronization coefficient (s) was significantly reduced at sparsity levels ranging from 0.28 to 0.30. For the functional network, the small-world index aLp in the aMCI group was significantly lower than that in the HC group; Rich-club nodes showed redistribution, and the Rich-club coefficient was increased within a certain Degree range; aEg was significantly increased; the Assortativity index (r > 0) indicated assortativity; the Hierarchy index (b > 0) was observed within a specific sparsity range.ConclusionWe identified a \u201cstructure-function dissociation\u201d in aMCI, where the structural network suffers from fragmentation and hub disruption, while the functional network compensates through rigid, hyper-localized reorganization with elevated local efficiency. This divergence reveals a core pathological mechanism of the disease.",

      "content": "Depression, one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders, continues to pose escalating global health challenges. Despite the discovery of numerous antidepressants, their clinical applications are limited, and there is still an urgent need to identify more effective antidepressant drugs and their molecular targets. In recent years, sigma receptors have garnered considerable interest among depression researchers because of their diverse biological functions and significant roles in the central nervous system. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the potential roles of sigma receptors and their ligands in the pathogenesis of depression and the course of antidepressant treatment, with the aim of offering insights into further research and potential therapeutic development.",

      "title": "Muscle responses to limb block during spontaneous movements in infants",
      "content": "Young infants manifest prominent neuromuscular responses to changes in muscle length, along with a variety of spontaneous movements. The first months of life are an important period during which sensorimotor integration and muscle tone gradually mature. In adults, muscle responses may also be observed when coordinated limb movements are transiently blocked. Given that infants normally exhibit spontaneous limb activity, here we examined whether a transient upper or lower limb block evoked consistent muscle responses while the infants were allowed to perform spontaneous movements with the other limbs. We examined polymyographic recordings in 12 bilateral arm and leg muscles in full-term and preterm infants (1\u20137\u202fmonths old). Overall, muscle activity, its spectral characteristics, and agonist\u2013antagonist coactivation were comparable before and after the block in both full-term and preterm infants, suggesting that the transient limb immobilization effect is not evident or consistent, as opposed to previously reported prominent muscle responses to muscle lengthening or shortening. The lack of consistent muscular responses to limb block supports the idea that individual limb motion during spontaneous movements is relatively independent of the control of other limbs, and that sensory input during changes in muscle length is more effective in revealing sensorimotor connections than its non-appearance.",

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.
