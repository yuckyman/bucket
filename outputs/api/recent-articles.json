      "title": "The hands of time: Moving my body to keep time order in the brain",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.16616v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network, be it at small scale made of cells, mostly neurons, or at larger scale made of neuronal assemblies. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest attempt to walk in the footsteps of classical thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator in physics, or the cogito in philosophy.",

      "title": "Real-time functional connectivity-based neurofeedback of the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during threat-exposure attenuates anxiety",
      "content": "Background: Adaptive regulation of negative emotion is vital for mental health and dysregulations in this domain contribute to the major mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. On the neural level, efficient emotion regulation has been linked to functional communication between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the amygdala. Gaining voluntary control over this pathway may present an effective strategy for potentiating emotion regulation. Objective: Against this background, we developed a novel connectivity-based real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) training that enables individuals to gain volitional control over the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during exposure to threatening stimuli. Methods: The study employed a pre-registered, randomized, sham-controlled design with the experimental group (n = 22) receiving real-time NF information on connectivity between the right DLPFC and the amygdala during threat exposure and the sham control group (n = 23) receiving connectivity NF from a circuit not related to emotion regulation. The ability to maintain regulatory control in the absence of feedback was assessed after four NF runs. Primary outcomes included functional connectivity of the target pathway, as well as anxiety scores. Results: The results demonstrate that successful acquisition of self-regulation of the rDLPFC-amygdala top-down regulatory circuit in the experimental NF group facilitated attenuation of anxiety. Conclusion: In summary, our findings suggest that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows to volitionally enhance rDLPFC-amygdala connectivity, and in turn reduces negative emotional states, rendering the training a promising neurotechnology intervention for mental disorders.",

      "title": "Juvenile reinstatement of TCF4 in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome model mice reveals a critical window for genetic intervention",
      "content": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 which encodes transcription factor 4. As PTHS therapeutics advance toward clinical trials, identifying the optimal timing for treatment is crucial. Our previous research demonstrated that restoring TCF4 during embryonic or neonatal stages, corresponding to prenatal or neonatal periods in humans, improved phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model (Kim et al., 2022). However, PTHS diagnosis generally occurs much later, when infants fail to reach developmental milestones and undergo genetic testing. This raises an essential question: can genetic therapeutics initiated at more clinically relevant time points retain effectiveness? Here, we examined whether reinstating TCF4 in juvenile PTHS model mice could reverse behavioral phenotypes, simulating a gene therapy. Our findings indicate that this delayed intervention largely fails to correct most phenotypes, except for a measure of cognitive function. These results reveal phenotype-specific plasticity and underscore a narrow, early critical window for effective treatment in PTHS. Our study also identifies the hippocampus as a potential target for PTHS therapeutics and suggests that while some cognitive functions may still retain therapeutic plasticity, reversing most core PTHS symptoms may require intervention during the very early postnatal, or potentially prenatal periods, in humans.",

      "title": "In vivo human embryonic spinal cord atlas validates stem cell-derived human dorsal interneurons and reveals ASD spinal signatures",
      "content": "Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in the loss of motor and sensory function. We are working towards restoring sensation by developing directed differentiation protocols to generate dorsal spinal interneurons (dIs; dI1-dI6) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we present an improved method that produces human dIs via a neuromesodermal progenitor state, the physiological intermediate for spinal cord development. We show that retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 11 direct dI identity, while GDF11 and extended time in culture promotes posterior spinal identities. Together, these protocols generate the full complement of dorsal subtypes along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord. To benchmark in vitro-derived dIs, we constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas of the human embryonic spinal cord and used it to show that hESC-derived dIs closely match their endogenous counterparts. The atlas also reveals that the dI4/dI5 populations dramatically expand in comparison with the other spinal lineages. Moreover, they have mechanosensory circuit signatures linked to autism spectrum disorder, implicating spinal circuits in autistic phenotypes.",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Dopamine Availability and Immune Activation Interact and Relate to Anhedonia Severity among Youth with Depression",
      "content": "Anhedonia emerges in adolescence, has putative substrates in neural reward and dopamine systems, and is a hallmark of poor course in depression. Psychoneuroimmunology models suggest altered immune and reward systems may jointly underlie its development. When dopamine availability (rather than function) is considered, immune activation may be understood as a moderator amplifying how lower dopamine levels translate into motivational deficits. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 55 youth with current depression (Mage=21.4 years; Female=75%). Plasma was assayed for relative quantification of 92 immune proteins, followed by dimensionality reduction via principal component (PC) analysis, forming five PC scores. Dopamine availability was indexed by basal ganglia tissue iron, quantified by MRI R2', a measure detectable in youth. Anhedonia was assessed using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), thought to capture overall anhedonia, and Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS), which provides overall, anticipatory, and consummatory anhedonia scores. PC1 scores-whose loadings indicated broadly distributed immune protein elevations consistent with general immune activation-moderated the relationship between basal ganglia dopamine availability and anhedonia: At higher PC1 levels, lower dopamine availability was linked to greater overall anhedonia (as measured by SHAPS) and anticipatory anhedonia, but not to consummatory anhedonia. Lower PC2 scores were associated with greater PVSS overall and consummatory anhedonia. Analyses examining individual basal ganglia regions suggest potential differences in dopaminergic-immune interactions across these regions, with effects most consistently observed in the putamen. Findings highlight nuanced neuroimmune pathways underlying anhedonia components in youth and support inflammation-based models of depression emphasizing dopaminergic-immune interplay.",

      "title": "Early adversity potentiates prefrontal - amygdala communication through CRH+ glutamatergic neurons",
      "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) has enduring impacts on emotion circuit function. Following early maltreatment, neglect, or instability in the home, individuals often exhibit lifelong impairments in their evaluation and response to threats. These behavioral changes typically emerge during adolescence and can disrupt this period of enhanced exploration that drives experience-dependent maturation in emotional brain systems. However, the mechanisms linking ELA to increased threat responses remain unclear. We identified a stress-sensitive medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-basolateral amygdala pathway that co-expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and glutamate. We find that ELA strengthens this pathway and increases threat avoidance behavior during adolescence. Inhibiting this pathway rescues ELA-induced elevations in adolescent avoidance, selectively in males. Reducing mPFC CRH expression earlier in development in typically-reared mice mimics ELA phenotypes in males. Together, our findings indicate that CRH signaling regulates developmental circuit plasticity, biasing emotional circuit function and potentially contributing to psychiatric vulnerability.",

      "title": "Hippocampal Cdk5 is regulated by distinct stress paradigms in male and female mice",
      "content": "Anxiety and mood disorders have been rising since the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by social isolation and stress. Women are disproportionately affected by stress-related disorders, yet the interaction between social isolation and stress remains understudied in females. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical kinase that exhibits sex-specific regulation following various stressors but is studied almost exclusively in males. To complement these findings, we examined sex differences in mouse hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA and protein following short and long restraint stress with or without concomitant social isolation stress. While short restraint stress was sufficient to promote anxiety-like in both male and female mice, it did not alter Cdk5. Rather, hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA increased only after a longer restraint stress duration followed by social isolation, and only in male mice. Hippocampal Cdk5 protein also shifted from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment only in male hippocampus. Surprisingly, repeated restraint stress promoted exploratory behavior in both group-housed and socially isolated male and female mice. Social isolation alone increased Cdk5 protein in females only. Finally, under all conditions, female mice were less immobile and more exploratory than male mice. Together, these results provide new insight into the sex-specific regulation of hippocampal Cdk5 by the combination of psychological and environmental stressors.",

      "title": "Spatially resolved translational dysregulation in Grin2a+/- mouse model of schizophrenia",
      "content": "Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations of GRIN2A, encoding the GluN2A subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), confer a high risk for schizophrenia (SCZ), yet how they affect diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we combined subcellular-resolution spatial omics technologies, STARmap and RIBOmap, to jointly resolve single-cell transcriptomes and translatomes for 3,447 genes in the brains of Grin2a+/- mice and their wild-type littermates across 538,188 cells. Translational dysregulation was markedly more prominent than transcriptional changes in neurons. Across neuronal subtypes, a set of genes including Camk2a, Arc, Egr1, Egr3, Chmp2b, and Pja2 exhibited translational reduction in a Grin2a gene dose-dependent fashion, suggesting a connection between NMDAR hypofunction and reduced protein synthesis of downstream synaptic plasticity effectors. In interneurons (particularly parvalbumin interneurons), a strong reduction of Gad2 translation implies loss of inhibitory function in cortical microcircuits, which has long been hypothesized for SCZ pathophysiology. Non-neuronal cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular cells also exhibited region-specific translational changes in neurotransmitter transport, lipid synthesis, myelination, and stress response pathways, some of which co-varied with regional neuron state. Together, our study reveals brain-wide translation dysregulation as a critical mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology.",

      "title": "Figure--ground relationship of voices in musical structure modulates reciprocal frontotemporal connectivity",
      "content": "When listening to polyphonic music, we often perceive a melody as the figure against the ground of accompanying sounds. However, with repeated exposure, this figure--ground relationship may naturally shift, allowing the melody to recede into the ground. In a previous study, we found the consistent pattern of frontotemporal connectivity for the ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' (TTLS) melody in the headings of two variations (II and IV) in Mozart's 12 Variations, K. 265, indicating that the TTLS melody, but not the different lower voices, was the figure. However, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern may change in the same phrases repeating in the two variations. In the current study, we examined how frontotemporal connectivity changes in the repeated phrases. In the results, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern between the two variations changed in the final phrase after repeated passages. This suggests that the shift in the figure--ground relationship persists, with the TTLS melody becoming less prominent while the lower voices become relatively more prominent. Additionally, frontotemporal connectivity was strongly correlated with temporofrontal connectivity in the opposite direction. Finally, our data indicate that TTLS melody-based and sensory-based processes in response to a switched figure--ground relationship, are incorporated into the bidirectional connections between frontotemporal and temporofrontal connectivity. Our study highlights the brain's ability to reconfigure figure--ground relationships in the processing of musical voices.",

      "title": "Concreteness shapes semantic representations in bilingual brains",
      "content": "Behavioral studies show that humans process concrete words more similarly across languages than abstract words. This suggests that in bilingual brains, semantic representations may be more similar across languages for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, but existing neuroimaging evidence is inconclusive. Here, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from fluent Chinese-English bilinguals who read several hours of naturalistic narratives in both languages. We used encoding models to estimate voxelwise tuning towards concrete and abstract concepts in each language separately. We then quantified the similarity of cortical semantic representations across languages. First, we find that the cortical organization of concreteness tuning is consistent across languages. Second, semantic representations are similar across languages for both concrete-tuned voxels and abstract-tuned voxels. Third, we find that for abstract concepts, cross-language similarity of semantic representations may be driven by emotionality. Overall, these findings reveal how concreteness affects semantic representations in bilingual brains.",

      "content": "Communication connects us to others and immerses us in our environment. Mobile EEG and hearing aid-embedded motion sensors allow investigation of communication and movement in real-world contexts. Here we reliably record and model neural responses to natural conversational speech while participants are walking, demonstrating the feasibility of combining EEG with whole-body movement monitoring. Participants (N = 61) performed focused listening and natural conversation while walking indoors and outdoors. Motion sensors, EEG, and audio recordings captured behavioural, neural, and motor dynamics. Walking speed varied with environment and task: faster outdoors and slower during speaking. Temporal alignment between gait and speech revealed coordinated rhythmic interactions, stronger during speaking than listening. Auditory temporal response functions were preserved across listening tasks. Gait TRFs displayed lateralized and temporal dynamics consistent across tasks. These results provide insight into the coordinated interplay of speech, brain activity, and movement. This highlights the potential of multimodal approaches in ecologically valid settings.",

      "content": "Objective. To enhance frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly under short data acquisition and complex environmental conditions. Approach. We propose multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis (MSDFA), a novel method that integrates multi-stimulus strategies with discriminant modeling. MSDFA was evaluated on two public datasets (Benchmark and BETA) and compared with conventional approaches including eCCA, eTRCA, and their variants. Main results. MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of 247.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15\u2009bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.44\u2009bpm on the BETA dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency. Significance. By combining complementary algorithmic strengths, MSDFA improves adaptability to individual variability and complex environments, advancing the practical utility and reliability of SSVEP-BCI systems.",
