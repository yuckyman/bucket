      "title": "Neurally-Informed Models of Protracted Sequential Sampling of Long, Noise-free Stimuli",
      "content": "Sequential sampling models have provided a rich theoretical framework in the study of perceptual decision-making and quantitatively capture diverse behavioural data. However, research has increasingly highlighted that for the long-duration, statistically stationary stimuli commonly studied, it is difficult to definitively establish the operation of protracted sampling or temporal integration as opposed to non-integration strategies like extremum-detection, especially when based on behaviour alone. Here, we attempted to resolve such mechanistic details in the interesting case of judging subtle feature-differences (contrast) in a long (1.6-sec), noiseless stimulus, by jointly analysing the accuracy of delayed reports and the dynamics of a centroparietal electroencephalographic signal (CPP) reflecting decision formation. Accuracy steadily increased across four covertly-manipulated evidence durations and the CPP remained elevated throughout the stimulus period, together indicating protracted sampling. Models fit to CPP dynamics as well as accuracy resolved more details than those fit to accuracy alone, such as the setting of a bound. However, a convincing joint neural-behaviour fit could be achieved not only by a temporal integration model, but also by an extremum detection model that evoked a stereotyped signal flagging the first single-sample bound crossing. This illuminates interesting, testable alternatives to integration, and the limited extent to which combining neural decision dynamics with behavioural information can uniquely identify underlying mechanisms in some behavioural scenarios.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) exhibits strong resilience in nutrient-poor soils and contains high levels of dietary fiber and antioxidant compounds. It also is highly tolerant to water stress, which has also contributed to its global distribution, particularly in regions prone to climatic variability. However, frequent abnormal climatic events have recently caused declines in both the quality and yield of sweet potatoes. To address this, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated insignificant changes in accommodation and binocular functions in myopic children after 12 months of wearing DIMS lenses. However, the absence of a control group limits causal interpretation, as observed changes may be influenced by natural development, repeated testing, or regression to the mean. Further research with controlled designs is warranted to clarify these effects.",

Journal of Animal Ecology. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.70117. Habitat loss is driving biodiversity collapse worldwide. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied across many taxa and regions, we still lack information about whether species with distinct life histories respond differently to habitat loss.
