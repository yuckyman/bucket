      "title": "The ventral visual stream for reading converges on the transmodal language network",
      "content": "Reading bridges sensation and cognition. To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this region's role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this \"orthographic stream\" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing. This basal language network region may represent an interface between visual and transmodal language systems, thus serving as a critical nexus for reading.",

      "title": "Hemispheric laterality of the putamen predicts pseudoneglect",
      "content": "Healthy individuals tend to exhibit a subtle leftward attentional bias, a phenomenon termed pseudoneglect. While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain. Our findings pave the way for early diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with subcortical atrophies including Parkinson's Disease and dementia.",

      "content": "<p><i>MiRNA</i>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <i>miRNAs</i> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <i>miR-153</i> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <i>miR-153</i> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <i>miR-153</i> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <i>miR-153</i> suppressed <i>KPNA5</i> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. These findings reveal a potential role of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in CCH-related cognitive decline.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Impact of Elovl5 Deficiency on Cerebellar Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice",
      "content": "<p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <i>Elovl5</i> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>",

      "title": "Peripheral Gating of Nociception Investigated with a Decerebrate, Arterially Perfused Preparation of the Rat",
      "content": "<p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for \"gating\" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as \"filtering,\" was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>",

      "title": "Combined Auditory, Tactile, and Visual FMRI Reveals Sensory-Biased and Supramodal Working Memory Regions in the Human Frontal Cortex",
      "content": "<p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <i>N-</i>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>",

      "title": "Altered Molecular Composition of a Specific Subset of Prefrontal Cortical Excitatory Synapses in Schizophrenia",
      "content": "<p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>",
