      "title": "The role of MICOS in modulating mitochondrial dynamics and structural changes in vulnerable regions of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complexes are critical for maintaining the mitochrondrial architecture, cristae integrity, and organelle communication in neurons. MICOS disruption has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of MICOS-associated neuronal alterations during aging remain unclear. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of hypothalamic and cortical neurons, we observed age-dependent fragmentation of mitochondrial cristae, reduced intermitochondrial connectivity, and compartment-specific changes in mitochondrial size and morphology. Notably, these structural deficits were most pronounced in neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathology, suggesting a mechanistic link between MICOS disruption and the early mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with AD. Our findings indicate that the loss of MICOS integrity is a progressive feature of neuronal aging, contributing to impaired bioenergetics and reduced resilience to metabolic stress and potentially facilitating neurodegenerative processes. MICOS disruption reduced neuronal firing and synaptic responsiveness, with miclxin treatment decreasing mitochondrial connectivity and inducing cristae disorganization. These changes link MICOS structural deficits directly to impaired neuronal excitability, highlighting vulnerability to AD-related neurodegeneration. These results underscore the importance of MICOS as a critical determinant of neuronal mitochondrial health and as a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "content": "Significance: Behavior scoring is labor-intensive and subjective, introducing variability in results. Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area. In 549/1058 of videos, Gemini 2.5 Pro also provided completely accurate frame-to- frame behaviour segmentations. Conclusions: Video-LLMs offer potential to accelerate neuroscience by providing scalable, objective quantification of goal-directed behaviors. By producing temporal annotations, Gemini enables fast first-pass labelling that markedly streamlines manual dataset curation.",

      "title": "MRS4Brain: a processing toolbox for preclinical MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging data",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique for probing metabolism and underpins advanced methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS). MRSI enables spatial mapping of metabolite distributions, offering insights into regional metabolic heterogeneity that single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) cannot capture. However, MRSI produces large multidimensional datasets and requires complex processing pipelines, limiting reproducibility and accessibility. While human studies benefit from advanced processing tools, similar developments in preclinical research remain scarce, highlighting a demand for practical tools accessible to non-experts. To address this need, we introduce the MRS4Brain Toolbox, a freely available MATLAB-based platform for preclinical spectroscopy, including MRSI, SVS, and DWS. The toolbox integrates reconstruction, preprocessing, quantification, quality control, brain segmentation automatically overlaid on metabolite maps, modeling, and statistical analysis into unified workflows accessible via a graphical interface. By streamlining data processing and reducing technical barriers, MRS4Brain Toolbox promotes reproducibility, harmonization, and broader adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in preclinical studies, ultimately facilitating translational research.",

      "title": "Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging in the ex vivo macaque brain on a 10.5T human MRI scanner",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI provides a non-invasive probe of local fibre bundles and long-range anatomical connections to characterise the structural connectome. One way to achieve very high spatial resolution diffusion MRI data for connectivity investigations is to scan ex-vivo brains over many hours or days, ideally at ultra-high field strength to boost signal levels. However, conventional diffusion MRI acquisition techniques do not generally deliver good data quality for the challenging conditions of ex-vivo tissue, characterised by reduced diffusivities and relaxation times when compared to in vivo. In this work, we investigate the potential of the diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) sequence for ex vivo diffusion imaging of the macaque brain using a 10.5 T human MRI scanner with a conventional (G_max=70 mT/m) gradient set. SNR-efficiency optimisations incorporating experimental relaxation times demonstrate that the DW-SSFP sequence is predicted to achieve improved or similar SNR efficiency compared to a diffusion-weighted spin- and stimulated-echo sequence. Importantly, DW-SSFP can achieve this with the additional benefit of negligible geometric distortions, unlike conventional diffusion MRI using an echo-planar imaging readout. Using optimised DW-SSFP sequence parameters, we propose a protocol at 0.4 mm isotropic resolution using a two-shell multi-orientation protocol (effective b-values of 3200 s/mm^2 and 5600 s/mm^2). We fit the data using Tensor, Ball and 3-Sticks and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution signal representations. The results demonstrate high-quality diffusivity estimates across the entire brain with the ability to resolve multiple fibre populations in challenging crossing-fibre regions. The data will be made fully open source and multimodal as part of the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics, providing a resource for future connectivity investigations.",

Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

I wasn't comfortable with all that, so this year I built my own.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>WhatsApp Wrapped generates visual reports for your group chats. You export your chat from WhatsApp (without media), run it through the tool, and get an HTML report with analytics. Everything runs locally or in your own Colab session. Nothing gets sent anywhere.</p> <p><a href=\"https://duelion.github.io/whatsapp-wrapped/sample_report.html\">Here is a Sample Report.</a></p> <p>Features include message counts, activity patterns, emoji stats, word clouds, and calendar heatmaps. The easiest way to use it is through <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped/blob/main/whatsapp_wrapped.ipynb\">Google Colab</a> - just upload your chat export and download the report. There's also a CLI for local use.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Anyone who wants to analyze their WhatsApp chats without uploading them to someone else's server. It's ready to use now.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Unlike other web tools that require uploading your data, this runs entirely on your machine (or your own Colab). It's also open source, so you can see exactly what it does with your chats.</p> <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Polars, Plotly, Jinja2.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - <a href=\"https://github.com/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped\">GitHub</a> - <a href=\"https://duelion.github.io/whatsapp-wrapped/sample_report.html\">Sample Report</a> - <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/Duelion/whatsapp-wrapped/blob/main/whatsapp_wrapped.ipynb\">Google Colab</a></p> <p>Happy to answer questions or hear feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Duelion\"> /u/Duelion </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po9n17/whatsapp_wrapped_with_polars_plotly_analyze_chat/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1po9n17/whatsapp_wrapped_with_polars_plotly_analyze_chat/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Rehabilitation drives functional reorganization of intact corticospinal-supraspinal projections following partial spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity and impairs skilled voluntary movement, yet most human SCIs are anatomically incomplete, allowing spared CST pathways to engage in rehabilitation-mediated plasticity to promote functional recovery. How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery. These findings identify a set of spinally-projecting medullary nuclei as key substrates for rehabilitation-induced CST plasticity and highlight the MdV as a potential mediator of restored motor function. This work defines how voluntary rehabilitation reorganizes spared corticospinal pathways and provides targets for optimizing activity-based interventions after SCI.",
