      "title": "Torsional Force by Helical Pericytes Regulates Blood Flow in Downstream Capillaries",
      "content": "This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.",

      "title": "Early Diabetic Ca2+ Handling Impairments in the Rod Bipolar Pathway",
      "content": "Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses. The underlying mechanism for this alteration is complex and not yet clearly elucidated.",

      "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

      "title": "Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions",
      "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

      "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

      "content": "Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.",

      "content": "<p>When I bought my home, the big bank I'd been using for years quoted me 7% APR. A local credit union was offering 5.5% for the exact same mortgage.<p>I was surprised until I learned that mortgages are basically standardized products \u2013 the government buys almost all of them (see Bits About Money: <a href=\"https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/mortgages-are-a-manufactured-product/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/mortgages-are-a-manuf...</a>). So what's the price difference paying for? A recent Bloomberg Odd Lots episode makes the case that it's largely advertising and marketing (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-11-28/odd-lots-this-is-why-credit-card-rates-are-so-high-podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-11-28/odd-lots-thi...</a>). Credit unions are non-profits without big marketing budgets, so they can pass those savings on, but a lot of people don't know about them.<p>I built this dashboard to make it easier to shop around. I pull public rates from 120+ credit union websites and compares against the weekly FRED national benchmark.<p>Features:<p>- Filter by loan type (30Y/15Y/etc.), eligibility (the hardest part tbh), and rate type\n- Payment calculator with refi mode (CUs can be a bit slower than big lenders, but that makes them great for refi)\n- Links to each CU's rates page and eligibility requirements\n- Toggle to show/hide statistical outliers<p>At the time of writing, the average CU rate is 5.91% vs. 6.23% national average. about $37k difference in total interest on a $500k loan. I actually used seaborn to visualize the rate spread against the four big banks: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1pcj9t7/oc_the_high_cost_of_big_banks_i_tracked_daily/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1pcj9t7/oc...</a><p>Stack: Python for the data/backend, Svelte/SvelteKit for the frontend.
