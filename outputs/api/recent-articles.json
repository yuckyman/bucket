      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Kreuzberg v4.0.0-rc.8 is available",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Peeps,</p> <p>I'm excited to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg\">Kreuzberg</a> v4.0.0 is coming very soon. We will release v4.0.0 at the beginning of next year - in just a couple of weeks time. For now, v4.0.0-rc.8 has been released to all channels.</p> <h2>What is Kreuzberg?</h2> <p>Kreuzberg is a document intelligence toolkit for extracting text, metadata, tables, images, and structured data from 56+ file formats. It was originally written in Python (v1-v3), where it demonstrated strong performance characteristics compared to alternatives in the ecosystem.</p> <h2>What's new in V4?</h2> <h3>A Complete Rust Rewrite with Polyglot Bindings</h3> <p>The new version of Kreuzberg represents a massive architectural evolution. <strong>Kreuzberg has been completely rewritten in Rust</strong> - leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and native performance. The new architecture consists of a high-performance Rust core with native bindings to multiple languages. That's right - it's no longer just a Python library.</p> <p><strong>Kreuzberg v4 is now available for 7 languages across 8 runtime bindings:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Rust</strong> (native library)</li> <li><strong>Python</strong> (PyO3 native bindings)</li> <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - Node.js (NAPI-RS native bindings) + Deno/Browser/Edge (WASM)</li> <li><strong>Ruby</strong> (Magnus FFI)</li> <li><strong>Java 25+</strong> (Panama Foreign Function &amp; Memory API)</li> <li><strong>C#</strong> (P/Invoke)</li> <li><strong>Go</strong> (cgo bindings)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Post v4.0.0 roadmap includes:</strong></p> <ul> <li>PHP</li> <li>Elixir (via Rustler - with Erlang and Gleam interop)</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, it's available as a <strong>CLI</strong> (installable via <code>cargo</code> or <code>homebrew</code>), <strong>HTTP REST API server</strong>, <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP) server</strong> for Claude Desktop/Continue.dev, and as <strong>public Docker images</strong>.</p> <h3>Why the Rust Rewrite? Performance and Architecture</h3> <p>The Rust rewrite wasn't just about performance - though that's a major benefit. It was an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the architecture:</p> <p><strong>Architectural improvements:</strong> - <strong>Zero-copy operations</strong> via Rust's ownership model - <strong>True async concurrency</strong> with Tokio runtime (no GIL limitations) - <strong>Streaming parsers</strong> for constant memory usage on multi-GB files - <strong>SIMD-accelerated text processing</strong> for token reduction and string operations - <strong>Memory-safe FFI boundaries</strong> for all language bindings - <strong>Plugin system</strong> with trait-based extensibility</p> <h3>v3 vs v4: What Changed?</h3> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>v3 (Python)</th> <th>v4 (Rust Core)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Core Language</strong></td> <td>Pure Python</td> <td>Rust 2024 edition</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>File Formats</strong></td> <td>30-40+ (via Pandoc)</td> <td><strong>56+ (native parsers)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Support</strong></td> <td>Python only</td> <td><strong>7 languages</strong> (Rust/Python/TS/Ruby/Java/Go/C#)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dependencies</strong></td> <td>Requires Pandoc (system binary)</td> <td><strong>Zero system dependencies</strong> (all native)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Embeddings</strong></td> <td>Not supported</td> <td>\u2713 FastEmbed with ONNX (3 presets + custom)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Semantic Chunking</strong></td> <td>Via semantic-text-splitter library</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (text + markdown-aware)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Token Reduction</strong></td> <td>Built-in (TF-IDF based)</td> <td>\u2713 Enhanced with 3 modes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Language Detection</strong></td> <td>Optional (fast-langdetect)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (68 languages)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong></td> <td>Optional (KeyBERT)</td> <td>\u2713 Built-in (YAKE + RAKE algorithms)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>OCR Backends</strong></td> <td>Tesseract/EasyOCR/PaddleOCR</td> <td><strong>Same + better integration</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Plugin System</strong></td> <td>Limited extractor registry</td> <td><strong>Full trait-based</strong> (4 plugin types)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Page Tracking</strong></td> <td>Character-based indices</td> <td><strong>Byte-based with O(1) lookup</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Servers</strong></td> <td>REST API (Litestar)</td> <td><strong>HTTP (Axum) + MCP + MCP-SSE</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Installation Size</strong></td> <td>~100MB base</td> <td><strong>16-31 MB complete</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Memory Model</strong></td> <td>Python heap management</td> <td><strong>RAII with streaming</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Concurrency</strong></td> <td>asyncio (GIL-limited)</td> <td><strong>Tokio work-stealing</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h3>Replacement of Pandoc - Native Performance</h3> <p>Kreuzberg v3 relied on <strong>Pandoc</strong> - an amazing tool, but one that had to be invoked via subprocess because of its GPL license. This had significant impacts:</p> <p><strong>v3 Pandoc limitations:</strong> - System dependency (installation required) - Subprocess overhead on every document - No streaming support - Limited metadata extraction - ~500MB+ installation footprint</p> <p><strong>v4 native parsers:</strong> - <strong>Zero external dependencies</strong> - everything is native Rust - Direct parsing with full control over extraction - <strong>Substantially more metadata</strong> extracted (e.g., DOCX document properties, section structure, style information) - <strong>Streaming support</strong> for massive files (tested on multi-GB XML documents with stable memory) - Example: PPTX extractor is now a <strong>fully streaming parser</strong> capable of handling gigabyte-scale presentations with constant memory usage and high throughput</p> <h3>New File Format Support</h3> <p>v4 expanded format support from ~20 to <strong>56+ file formats</strong>, including:</p> <p><strong>Added legacy format support:</strong> - <code>.doc</code> (Word 97-2003) - <code>.ppt</code> (PowerPoint 97-2003) - <code>.xls</code> (Excel 97-2003) - <code>.eml</code> (Email messages) - <code>.msg</code> (Outlook messages)</p> <p><strong>Added academic/technical formats:</strong> - LaTeX (<code>.tex</code>) - BibTeX (<code>.bib</code>) - Typst (<code>.typ</code>) - JATS XML (scientific articles) - DocBook XML - FictionBook (<code>.fb2</code>) - OPML (<code>.opml</code>)</p> <p><strong>Better Office support:</strong> - XLSB, XLSM (Excel binary/macro formats) - Better structured metadata extraction from DOCX/PPTX/XLSX - Full table extraction from presentations - Image extraction with deduplication</p> <h3>New Features: Full Document Intelligence Solution</h3> <p>The v4 rewrite was also an opportunity to close gaps with commercial alternatives and add features specifically designed for <strong>RAG applications and LLM workflows</strong>:</p> <h4>1. <strong>Embeddings (NEW)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>FastEmbed integration</strong> with full ONNX Runtime acceleration</li> <li>Three presets: <code>&quot;fast&quot;</code> (384d), <code>&quot;balanced&quot;</code> (512d), <code>&quot;quality&quot;</code> (768d/1024d)</li> <li>Custom model support (bring your own ONNX model)</li> <li>Local generation (no API calls, no rate limits)</li> <li>Automatic model downloading and caching</li> <li>Per-chunk embedding generation</li> </ul> <p>```python from kreuzberg import ExtractionConfig, EmbeddingConfig, EmbeddingModelType</p> <p>config = ExtractionConfig( embeddings=EmbeddingConfig( model=EmbeddingModelType.preset(&quot;balanced&quot;), normalize=True ) ) result = kreuzberg.extract_bytes(pdf_bytes, config=config)</p> <h1>result.embeddings contains vectors for each chunk</h1> <p>```</p> <h4>2. <strong>Semantic Text Chunking (NOW BUILT-IN)</strong></h4> <p>Now integrated directly into the core (v3 used external semantic-text-splitter library): - <strong>Structure-aware chunking</strong> that respects document semantics - Two strategies: - Generic text chunker (whitespace/punctuation-aware) - Markdown chunker (preserves headings, lists, code blocks, tables) - Configurable chunk size and overlap - Unicode-safe (handles CJK, emojis correctly) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping - Per-chunk metadata with byte offsets</p> <h4>3. <strong>Byte-Accurate Page Tracking (BREAKING CHANGE)</strong></h4> <p>This is a critical improvement for LLM applications:</p> <ul> <li><strong>v3</strong>: Character-based indices (<code>char_start</code>/<code>char_end</code>) - incorrect for UTF-8 multi-byte characters</li> <li><strong>v4</strong>: Byte-based indices (<code>byte_start</code>/<code>byte_end</code>) - correct for all string operations</li> </ul> <p>Additional page features: - O(1) lookup: &quot;which page is byte offset X on?&quot; \u2192 instant answer - Per-page content extraction - Page markers in combined text (e.g., <code>--- Page 5 ---</code>) - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping for citations</p> <h4>4. <strong>Enhanced Token Reduction for LLM Context</strong></h4> <p>Enhanced from v3 with three configurable modes to save on LLM costs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Light mode</strong>: ~15% reduction (preserve most detail)</li> <li><strong>Moderate mode</strong>: ~30% reduction (balanced)</li> <li><strong>Aggressive mode</strong>: ~50% reduction (key information only)</li> </ul> <p>Uses TF-IDF sentence scoring with position-aware weighting and language-specific stopword filtering. SIMD-accelerated for improved performance over v3.</p> <h4>5. <strong>Language Detection (NOW BUILT-IN)</strong></h4> <ul> <li>68 language support with confidence scoring</li> <li>Multi-language detection (documents with mixed languages)</li> <li>ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-3 code support</li> <li>Configurable confidence thresholds</li> </ul> <h4>6. <strong>Keyword Extraction (NOW BUILT-IN)</strong></h4> <p>Now built into core (previously optional KeyBERT in v3): - <strong>YAKE</strong> (Yet Another Keyword Extractor): Unsupervised, language-independent - <strong>RAKE</strong> (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction): Fast statistical method - Configurable n-grams (1-3 word phrases) - Relevance scoring with language-specific stopwords</p> <h4>7. <strong>Plugin System (NEW)</strong></h4> <p>Four extensible plugin types for customization:</p> <ul> <li><strong>DocumentExtractor</strong> - Custom file format handlers</li> <li><strong>OcrBackend</strong> - Custom OCR engines (integrate your own Python models)</li> <li><strong>PostProcessor</strong> - Data transformation and enrichment</li> <li><strong>Validator</strong> - Pre-extraction validation</li> </ul> <p>Plugins defined in Rust work across all language bindings. Python/TypeScript can define custom plugins with thread-safe callbacks into the Rust core.</p> <h4>8. <strong>Production-Ready Servers (NEW)</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>HTTP REST API</strong>: Production-grade Axum server with OpenAPI docs</li> <li><strong>MCP Server</strong>: Direct integration with Claude Desktop, Continue.dev, and other MCP clients</li> <li><strong>MCP-SSE Transport</strong> (RC.8): Server-Sent Events for cloud deployments without WebSocket support</li> <li>All three modes support the same feature set: extraction, batch processing, caching</li> </ul> <h2>Performance: Benchmarked Against the Competition</h2> <p>We maintain <strong>continuous benchmarks</strong> comparing Kreuzberg against the leading OSS alternatives:</p> <h3>Benchmark Setup</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Ubuntu 22.04 (GitHub Actions)</li> <li><strong>Test Suite</strong>: 30+ documents covering all formats</li> <li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Latency (p50, p95), throughput (MB/s), memory usage, success rate</li> <li><strong>Competitors</strong>: Apache Tika, Docling, Unstructured, MarkItDown</li> </ul> <h3>How Kreuzberg Compares</h3> <p><strong>Installation Size</strong> (critical for containers/serverless): - <strong>Kreuzberg</strong>: <strong>16-31 MB complete</strong> (CLI: 16 MB, Python wheel: 22 MB, Java JAR: 31 MB - all features included) - <strong>MarkItDown</strong>: ~251 MB installed (58.3 KB wheel, 25 dependencies) - <strong>Unstructured</strong>: ~146 MB minimal (open source base) - <strong>several GB with ML models</strong> - <strong>Docling</strong>: ~1 GB base, <strong>9.74GB Docker image</strong> (includes PyTorch CUDA) - <strong>Apache Tika</strong>: ~55 MB (tika-app JAR) + dependencies - <strong>GROBID</strong>: 500MB (CRF-only) to <strong>8GB</strong> (full deep learning)</p> <p><strong>Performance Characteristics:</strong></p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Library</th> <th>Speed</th> <th>Accuracy</th> <th>Formats</th> <th>Installation</th> <th>Use Case</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Kreuzberg</strong></td> <td>\u26a1 Fast (Rust-native)</td> <td>Excellent</td> <td>56+</td> <td><strong>16-31 MB</strong></td> <td><strong>General-purpose, production-ready</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Docling</strong></td> <td>\u26a1 Fast (3.1s/pg x86, 1.27s/pg ARM)</td> <td>Best</td> <td>7+</td> <td>1-9.74 GB</td> <td>Complex documents, when accuracy &gt; size</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>GROBID</strong></td> <td>\u26a1\u26a1 Very Fast (10.6 PDF/s)</td> <td>Best</td> <td>PDF only</td> <td>0.5-8 GB</td> <td><strong>Academic/scientific papers only</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Unstructured</strong></td> <td>\u26a1 Moderate</td> <td>Good</td> <td>25-65+</td> <td>146 MB-several GB</td> <td>Python-native LLM pipelines</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>MarkItDown</strong></td> <td>\u26a1 Fast (small files)</td> <td>Good</td> <td>11+</td> <td>~251 MB</td> <td><strong>Lightweight Markdown conversion</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Apache Tika</strong></td> <td>\u26a1 Moderate</td> <td>Excellent</td> <td><strong>1000+</strong></td> <td>~55 MB</td> <td>Enterprise, broadest format support</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><strong>Kreuzberg's sweet spot:</strong> - <strong>Smallest full-featured installation</strong>: 16-31 MB complete (vs 146 MB-9.74 GB for competitors) - <strong>5-15x smaller</strong> than Unstructured/MarkItDown, <strong>30-300x smaller</strong> than Docling/GROBID - <strong>Rust-native performance</strong> without ML model overhead - <strong>Broad format support</strong> (56+ formats) with native parsers - <strong>Multi-language support</strong> unique in the space (7 languages vs Python-only for most) - <strong>Production-ready</strong> with general-purpose design (vs specialized tools like GROBID)</p> <h2>Is Kreuzberg a SaaS Product?</h2> <p><strong>No.</strong> Kreuzberg is and will remain <strong>MIT-licensed open source</strong>.</p> <p>However, we are building <strong>Kreuzberg.cloud</strong> - a commercial SaaS and self-hosted document intelligence solution built <em>on top of</em> Kreuzberg. This follows the proven open-core model: the library stays free and open, while we offer a cloud service for teams that want managed infrastructure, APIs, and enterprise features.</p> <p><strong>Will Kreuzberg become commercially licensed?</strong> Absolutely not. There is no BSL (Business Source License) in Kreuzberg's future. The library was MIT-licensed and will remain MIT-licensed. We're building the commercial offering as a separate product around the core library, not by restricting the library itself.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Any developer or data scientist who needs: - Document text extraction (PDF, Office, images, email, archives, etc.) - OCR (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR) - Metadata extraction (authors, dates, properties, EXIF) - Table and image extraction - Document pre-processing for RAG pipelines - Text chunking with embeddings - Token reduction for LLM context windows - Multi-language document intelligence in production systems</p> <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> - RAG application developers - Data engineers building document pipelines - ML engineers preprocessing training data - Enterprise developers handling document workflows - DevOps teams needing lightweight, performant extraction in containers/serverless</p> <h2>Comparison with Alternatives</h2> <h3>Open Source Python Libraries</h3> <p><strong>Unstructured.io</strong> - <strong>Strengths</strong>: Established, modular, broad format support (25+ open source, 65+ enterprise), LLM-focused, good Python ecosystem integration - <strong>Trade-offs</strong>: Python GIL performance constraints, 146 MB minimal installation (several GB with ML models) - <strong>License</strong>: Apache-2.0 - <strong>When to choose</strong>: Python-only projects where ecosystem fit &gt; performance</p> <p><strong>MarkItDown (Microsoft)</strong> - <strong>Strengths</strong>: Fast for small files, Markdown-optimized, simple API - <strong>Trade-offs</strong>: Limited format support (11 formats), less structured metadata, ~251 MB installed (despite small wheel), requires OpenAI API for images - <strong>License</strong>: MIT - <strong>When to choose</strong>: Markdown-only conversion, LLM consumption</p> <p><strong>Docling (IBM)</strong> - <strong>Strengths</strong>: Excellent accuracy on complex documents (97.9% cell-level accuracy on tested sustainability report tables), state-of-the-art AI models for technical documents - <strong>Trade-offs</strong>: Massive installation (1-9.74 GB), high memory usage, GPU-optimized (underutilized on CPU) - <strong>License</strong>: MIT - <strong>When to choose</strong>: Accuracy on complex documents &gt; deployment size/speed, have GPU infrastructure</p> <h3>Open Source Java/Academic Tools</h3> <p><strong>Apache Tika</strong> - <strong>Strengths</strong>: Mature, stable, broadest format support (1000+ types), proven at scale, Apache Foundation backing - <strong>Trade-offs</strong>: Java/JVM required, slower on large files, older architecture, complex dependency management - <strong>License</strong>: Apache-2.0 - <strong>When to choose</strong>: Enterprise environments with JVM infrastructure, need for maximum format coverage</p> <p><strong>GROBID</strong> - <strong>Strengths</strong>: Best-in-class for academic papers (F1 0.87-0.90), extremely fast (10.6 PDF/sec sustained), proven at scale (34M+ documents at CORE) - <strong>Trade-offs</strong>: Academic papers only, large installation (500MB-8GB), complex Java+Python setup - <strong>License</strong>: Apache-2.0 - <strong>When to choose</strong>: Scientific/academic document processing exclusively</p> <h3>Commercial APIs</h3> <p>There are numerous commercial options from startups (LlamaIndex, Unstructured.io paid tiers) to big cloud providers (AWS Textract, Azure Form Recognizer, Google Document AI).

      "title": "\u03b42-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.",

      "title": "Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons",
      "content": "The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.",

      "title": "Satellite microglia gate neuronal excitability by shielding inhibitory synapses in adult brain",
      "content": "Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.",

      "title": "A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons",
      "content": "Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel \"snapshot\" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.",

      "title": "Functional brain network analysis in patients with upper-limb spasticity after stroke",
      "content": "IntroductionStroke ranks as the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with the resulting upper-limb spasticity severely impairing patients\u2019 motor function and quality of life. However, existing clinical assessment scales exhibit a degree of subjectivity, and research into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spasticity remains insufficient. Brain network analysis offers a novel perspective for investigating the neural mechanisms associated with spasticity.MethodsEight patients with upper limb spasticity due to stroke (MAS grades 1\u20132) and eight healthy controls were enrolled. Multi-channel EEG signals were recorded during different upper limb movements (fist clenching, elbow flexion, wrist flexion). Functional brain networks were constructed using the weighted phase delay index, and further calculations were performed on relevant brain network characteristics, including node degree, global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-world properties.ResultsResearch findings indicate that functional connectivity in spasticity patients is significantly lower than in healthy subjects, particularly in the alpha and beta frequency bands, with weaker cross-regional synchrony in frontal, central, and temporal lobe regions. Graph theory analysis further reveals that compared to healthy controls, spasticity patients exhibit significantly reduced global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, while small-world properties remain relatively preserved. Node degree analysis revealed abnormal compensatory activation in temporal and parietal regions, whereas healthy participants exhibited higher node degrees in central and frontal areas. These findings suggest that spasticity is associated with impaired local and global network integration, accompanied by inefficient compensatory mechanisms.DiscussionThis study provides new evidence that post-stroke upper limb spasticity is not only a peripheral muscle phenomenon but also reflects disturbances in cortical network dynamics. Brain network metrics, particularly global and local efficiency, may serve as objective biomarkers to quantify spasticity severity and guide personalized rehabilitation interventions, offering a promising direction for developing precision rehabilitation strategies.",

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

      "title": "Association between hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory in middle-aged and older adult cancer patients",
      "content": "BackgroundCancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is relatively common among middle-aged and older adult cancer patients, with working memory deficits being particularly prominent. However, the underlying structural basis of hippocampal subregions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate differences in hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory function between cancer patients and healthy controls, as well as to analyze the correlation between hippocampal structural alterations and working memory impairment.MethodsThe cohort comprised 51 cancer patients and 45 healthy controls. All participants underwent 3D-T1 structural MRI scans and cognitive assessments. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented using FreeSurfer 7.4, and their volumes were calculated. Group differences in cognitive test scores were compared. After controlling for total intracranial volume (TIV), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine differences in hippocampal subfield volumes between groups. Spearman correlation analysis was undertaken to assess the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive test scores in patients with cancer.ResultsCompared with healthy controls, cancer patients exhibited significantly lower scores in the digit span test (DST) total score (U\u2009=\u2009716.50, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and digit span forward (DSF) subtest (U\u2009=\u2009738.50, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Hippocampal subfield analysis revealed significant volume reductions in the cancer group, particularly in CA3 (F\u2009=\u20098.141, p\u2009=\u20090.005) and CA4 (F\u2009=\u20096.770, p\u2009=\u20090.011). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the volumes of the hippocampal head (r\u2009=\u20090.410, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and hippocampal molecular layer (r\u2009=\u20090.389, p\u2009=\u20090.005) were positively associated with DST scores in cancer patients.ConclusionCancer patients exhibit working memory impairment and hippocampal subfield atrophy. The significant correlation between the volumes of the hippocampal head and molecular layer with working memory performance suggests that these regions may play a critical role in cancer-related cognitive dysfunction.",

      "title": "A study on the cognitive-consumption behavior of sports content on OTT media platforms: applying the extended technology acceptance model (E-TAM)",
      "content": "The purpose of this study is to provide basic data for the establishment of sustainable sports content and communication marketing strategies of effective OTT platforms by applying the extended technology acceptance model to clarify the causal relationship between the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, perceived interactivity, usage intention, and usage behavior of users who watch OTT platform sports content. To achieve this purpose, 303 viewers with experience watching OTT platform sports content were used for the analysis. The data analysis methods were frequency analysis, correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling analysis using SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 18.0. The results of this study are as follows. First, perceived usefulness was found to have no significant effect on usage intention. Second, perceived ease of use was found to have a significant effect on usage intention. Third, perceived enjoyment was found to have a significant effect on usage intention. Fourth, perceived interactivity was found to have a significant effect on usage intention. Fifth, usage intention was found to have a significant effect on usage behavior. Therefore, the intention of using OTT platform sports content will be to become a sustainable industry in terms of media business.",
