      "content": "Assessing the degree and characteristics of consciousness is central to caring for patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC), yet current standard of care is a bedside questionnaire. Using a laminar neural probe we introduce a self-supervised, multi-modal representation learning approach that constructs an interpretable 2-D latent space of brain state from continuous neural recordings. We jointly encode local field potentials (LFPs), single-unit firing rates, and a movement proxy into a time-aware autoregressive VAE (TN-VAE). In rats, pigs and humans undergoing controlled depth anesthesia experiments, the learned latent trajectories nonlinearly, but smoothly, separate four expert-defined states (awake, light, moderate, deep) at (2s) resolution, exceeding the temporal granularity of behavioral scoring (15m). The latent space supports linear readout of both coarse state and individual behavioral components, and its axes align with known physiology: delta/alpha power differentiates unconscious sub-states, while gamma and unit firing distinguish wakefulness. To enable cross-species use and incomplete modality sets, we add lightweight, species-specific stitching layers. This model pretrained on tri-modal rat data and fine-tuned with unimodal (LFP) pig data and unimodal human intraoperative data, successfully separates awake versus anesthetized states in new unseen human subjects, demonstrating zero-shot multi-subject transfer without per-patient calibration. The model further generalizes in a multi-task manner to predict the results of additional stimuli. These results highlight a path toward a foundation model for DoC that generalizes across sessions, subjects, species, and stimuli to enable scalable, continuous brain-state monitoring and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Age-Related Differences in the Lexical Priming Effect Can Be Predominantly Attributed to Differences in Response Bias",
      "content": "Age-related declines in visual perception challenge older adults' ability to locate and identify objects in noisy (e.g., fog, glare, inadequate lighting) or cluttered visual environments. To compensate, older adults often increase reliance on contextual information, which could be helpful, but may also lead to increased risk for false seeing, reporting expected objects based on contextual information rather than those actually presented, a phenomenon that Jacoby et al., (2012) observed in older adults under challenging viewing conditions. However, it remains unaddressed whether such false seeing is driven by older adults' elevated tendency to rely on context, or by age-related declines in visual perceptual processes. The current study addressed this issue by examining the lexical priming effects in 18 younger and 18 older adults (M = 21.4 years; M = 76.2 years) in Experiment 1, and 13 younger and 13 older adults (M = 21.2 years; M = 74.8 years) in Experiment 2 using a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm, while controlling for age-related perceptual differences. On each trial, participants identified a visually degraded target word preceded by an identical, semantically related, or unrelated prime. We applied Signal Detection Theory to isolate perceptual sensitivity and response bias. Results revealed that once stimulus parameters were adjusted to eliminate age-differences in performance when the prime was unrelated to the target, age-related differences in target identification in the related priming conditions were predominantly driven by age-related differences in response bias rather than in any residual age-differences in perceptual sensitivity.",

      "title": "N, N-Dimethyltryptamine and harmine formulation shifts metastable topography sequences in the cortex",
      "content": "Classic serotonergic psychedelics are potent modulators of conscious awareness, yet the principles governing their effects on the temporal dynamics of brain activity remain unclear. Dominant theories propose that psychedelics increase the signal diversity and metastability of neural states, but whether this reflects a simple randomization of activity or a more structured reorganization is unknown. Here, we used high-density EEG (n=25) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to delineate the effects of an ayahuasca-inspired formulation (intranasal N,N-DMT and buccal harmine) on the syntax of whole-brain functional states. Using microstate analysis, we show that psychedelic states induced by DMT and harmine are characterized by a profound acceleration of neural dynamics, evidenced by a reduced microstate duration and an increased frequency of state transitions. Despite that, the sequence of microstates became less random, as indicated by a higher first-order Markov statistic. This syntactic restructuring involved a systematic de-prioritization of transitions into one state (M2) and a corresponding increase in the prevalence and accessibility of two other states (M3 and M5). These findings reveal that the psychedelic state leads to a syntactically reconfigured state of heightened metastability. By showing that psychedelics both lead to an accelerated exploration of an expanded repertoire of neural states governed by increased syntactic structure, our findings improve our understanding of neural metastability in psychedelic states.",

      "title": "Leveraging unbiased LC-MS analysis to identify histone post-translational modifications associated with age-related decline of learning and memory",
      "content": "Age-associated cognitive decline is a significant societal challenge, with several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease becoming prevalent. Normal ageing is associated with several molecular, cellular, and metabolic hallmarks, including epigenetic mechanisms. In particular, dysregulation of post-translational modifications on histone tails is emerging as a mechanism associated with functional decline. The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is essential for the formation of episodic and spatial memories, which are particularly susceptible to age-related decline. In this perspective manuscript, we have used mass spectrometry as an unbiased method to profile histone tail post-translational modifications both at baseline and after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) from young and aged mouse hippocampi to identify age- and activity-dependent changes. Using this approach, we identify epigenetic marks not widely studied in ageing and in activity-induced learning. We propose a framework on how to integrate these epigenetic marks into current knowledge and discuss how to use this new analysis to formulate novel hypotheses that will broaden this field of ageing research. We believe that this work will be of interest to scientists, clinicians and the wider public by making a significant contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for age-associated cognitive decline and by reporting the identification of new mechanisms to focus on.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Retraining dorsal visual pathways improves cognitive skills and executive control networks following mild traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "Background and objectivesMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently results in persistent cognitive deficits with limited evidence-based rehabilitation options. Visual timing deficits, potentially linked to dorsal visual pathway dysfunction, represent a promising therapeutic target. This study examined whether a novel intervention targeting dorsal visual pathways (PATH) demonstrates superior efficacy compared to conventional cognitive therapies targeting ventral pathway deficits or working memory impairments.MethodsTwenty-four participants (aged 23\u201362 years) with mTBI were randomized to receive one of three interventions over 12 weeks: (1) PATH training targeting dorsal visual pathway function, (2) Orientation Discrimination (OD) targeting ventral pathway pattern discrimination, both of these 20-min interventions followed by 10-min of digit memory exercises, or (3) ReCollect, working memory training. Each intervention consisted of 36 sessions (30 min each, three times weekly). Primary outcome was visual working memory (VWM) performance; secondary outcomes included processing speed, reading speed, auditory working memory, selective attention, and cognitive flexibility assessed via standardized neuropsychological measures. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during resting state and an N-Back task provided neurophysiological validation.ResultsPATH training yielded significantly greater VWM improvements (49%) compared to ReCollect (13%) and OD (8%) interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed superior efficacy of dorsal pathway training (significant at p = 0.011). Similar gains for PATH training were also found for processing speed, reading speed, and cognitive flexibility, especially when compared to the OD group, revealing importance of strengthening the dorsal stream before digit memory exercises. MEG analysis revealed PATH-specific activation in not only bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, superior occipital gyri, but also the left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus, primary motor cortex, and the cerebellum, as well as lower gamma-band noise, suggesting enhanced neural timing, attention, working memory, memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms beyond the targeted dorsal pathways.ConclusionDorsal visual pathway retraining followed by targeted working memory exercises demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy for cognitive rehabilitation following mTBI compared to conventional approaches. The intervention promotes beneficial neuroplasticity extending to memory-related brain regions, supporting its potential as a targeted, mechanistically-informed therapy for post-concussive cognitive deficits.",

      "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",
