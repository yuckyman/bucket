      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.11564v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text entry in Virtual Reality (VR) is challenging, even when accounting for the use of controllers. Prior work has tackled this challenge head-on, improving the efficiency of input methods. These techniques have the advantage of allowing for relatively straightforward text correction. However, text correction without the use of controllers is a topic that has not received the same amount of attention, even though it can be desirable in several scenarios, and can even be the source of frustration. Large language models have been adopted and evaluated as a corrective methodology, given their high power for predictions. Nevertheless, their predictions are not always correct, which can lead to lower usability. In this paper, we investigate whether, for text correction in VR that is hands-free, the use of AI could surpass in terms of usability and efficiency. We observed better usability for AI text correction when compared to voice input.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.11472v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective communication of robotic touch intent is a key factor in promoting safe and predictable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). While intent communication has been widely studied, existing approaches lack the spatial specificity and semantic depth necessary to convey robot touch actions. We present Mirror Skin, a cephalopod-inspired concept that utilizes high-resolution, mirror-like visual feedback on robotic skin. By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent. These findings highlight the potential of visual feedback on robotic skin to communicate human-robot touch interactions.",

      "title": "AI Autonomy or Human Dependency? Defining the Boundary in Responsible AI with the ${\\alpha}$-Coefficient",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.11295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integrity of contemporary AI systems is undermined by a critical design flaw: the misappropriation of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to mask systems that are fundamentally reliant on human labor. We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence. This work advocates for a critical shift toward metric-driven, structurally sound AI architecture, moving the industry beyond deceptive human dependency toward verifiable autonomy.",

As populations age and caregiver networks shrink, the need for reliable support in Advance Care Planning (ACP) grows. To probe this fraught design space of using proxy agents for high-risk, high-subjectivity decisions, we built an experience prototype (\\acpagent{}) and asked 15 participants in 4 workshops to train it to be their personal proxy in ACP decisions. We analysed their coping strategies and feature requests and mapped the results onto axes of agent autonomy and human control. Our findings argue for a potential new role of AI in ACP where agents act as personal advocates for individuals, building mutual intelligibility over time. We conclude with design recommendations to balance the risks and benefits of such an agent.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.11245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Postoperative upper limb dysfunction is prevalent among breast cancer survivors, yet their adherence to at-home rehabilitation exercises is low amidst limited nursing resources. The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard. A preliminary clinical study validated the system's feasibility and user acceptance, with patients achieving an average exercise frequency of 0.59 sessions/day over a two-week period. This work thus presents a complete, validated pipeline for AI-driven, at-home rehabilitation monitoring.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.11105v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While drug discovery is vital for human health, the process remains inefficient. Medicinal chemists must navigate a vast protein space to identify target proteins that meet three criteria: physical and functional interactions, therapeutic impact, and docking potential. Prior approaches have provided fragmented support for each criterion, limiting the generation of promising hypotheses for wet-lab experiments. We present HAPPIER, an AI-powered tool that supports hypothesis generation with integrated multi-criteria support for target identification. HAPPIER enables medicinal chemists to 1) efficiently explore and verify proteins in a single integrated graph component showing multi-criteria satisfaction and 2) validate AI suggestions with domain knowledge. These capabilities facilitate iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, essential for hypothesis generation. We evaluated HAPPIER with ten medicinal chemists, finding that it increased the number of high-confidence hypotheses and support for the iterative cycle, and further demonstrated the relationship between engaging in such cycles and confidence in outputs.",

This study investigates how people use ChatGPT for such planning tasks, focusing on user practices, uncertainties, and perceptions of AI assistance. We conducted an interview study with 14 participants who engaged in long-term planning activities using ChatGPT, combining analysis of their prompts and interview responses. The task topics across diverse domains, including personal well-being, event planning, and professional learning, along with prompts to initiate, refine, and contextualize plans. ChatGPT helped structure complex goals into manageable steps, generate ideas, and sustain motivation, serving as a reflective partner. Yet its outputs were often generic or idealized, lacking personalization, contextual realism, and adaptability, requiring users to actively adapt and verify results. Participants expressed a need for AI systems that provide adaptive and trustworthy guidance while acknowledging uncertainty and potential failure in long-term planning. Our findings show how AI supports long-term life task planning under evolving uncertainty and highlight design implications for systems that are adaptive, uncertainty-aware, and capable of supporting long-term planning as an evolving human-AI collaboration.",

      "title": "Immutable Explainability: Towards Verifiable and Auditable Affective AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.11065v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Affective artificial intelligence has made substantial advances in recent years; yet two critical issues persist, particularly in sensitive applications. First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion). Beyond these quantitative outcomes, our primary objective is to establish a foundation for affective AI systems that offer transparent explanations, trustworthy audit trails, and greater user control over personal data.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.10961v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Through extensive experience training professionals and individual users in AI tool adoption since the GPT-3 era, I have observed a consistent pattern: the same AI tool produces dramatically different results depending on who uses it. While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.",

However, it remains challenging to effectively integrate multimodal MRI while achieving neuroscience interpretability. Here we propose to use Laplacian harmonics and spectral graph theory for multimodal alignment and multiscale integration. Based on the cortical mesh and connectome matrix that offer multi-scale representations, we devise Laplacian operators and spectral graph attentions to construct a shared latent space for model alignment. Next, we employ a disentangled learning combined with Graph Variational Autoencoder architectures to separate scale-specific and shared features. Lastly, we design a mutual information-informed bilevel regularizer to separate causal and non-causal factors based on the disentangled features, achieving robust model performance with enhanced interpretability. Our model outperforms baselines and other state-of-the-art models. The ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Our model promises to offer a robust and interpretable framework for multi-scale brain structure analysis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.11000v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Representations pervade our daily experience, from letters representing sounds to bit strings encoding digital files. While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness.",

      "title": "Mathematics of natural intelligence",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10988v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the process of evolution, the brain has achieved such perfection that artificial intelligence systems do not have and which needs its own mathematics. The concept of cognitome, introduced by the academician K.V. Anokhin, as the cognitive structure of the mind -- a high-order structure of the brain and a neural hypernetwork, is considered as the basis for modeling. Consciousness then is a special form of dynamics in this hypernetwork -- a large-scale integration of its cognitive elements. The cognitome, in turn, consists of interconnected COGs (cognitive groups of neurons) of two types -- functional systems and cellular ensembles. K.V. Anokhin sees the task of the fundamental theory of the brain and mind in describing these structures, their origin, functions and processes in them. The paper presents mathematical models of these structures based on new mathematical results, as well as models of different cognitive processes in terms of these models. In addition, it is shown that these models can be derived based on a fairly general principle of the brain works: \\textit{the brain discovers all possible causal relationships in the external world and draws all possible conclusions from them}. Based on these results, the paper presents models of: ``natural\" classification; theory of functional brain systems by P.K. Anokhin; prototypical theory of categorization by E. Roche; theory of causal models by Bob Rehter; theory of consciousness as integrated information by G. Tononi.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.10985v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The existence of 'what' and 'where' pathways of information processing in the brain was proposed almost 30 years ago, but there is still a lack of a clear mathematical model that could show how these pathways work together. We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution. We propose Self-Awareness Principle 1: the ability to separate the self from the world is a necessary but insufficient condition for self-awareness.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.10984v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.10982v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain dynamics dominate every level of neural organization -- from single-neuron spiking to the macroscopic waves captured by fMRI, MEG, and EEG -- yet the mathematical tools used to interrogate those dynamics remain scattered across a patchwork of traditions. Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \\emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.10981v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) persists as a paramount challenge in neurological research, characterized by the pathological hallmarks of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. This review synthesizes the evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis, moving beyond the linear amyloid cascade hypothesis to conceptualize the disease as a cross-talk of intricately interacting pathologies, encompassing Abeta, tau, and neuroinflammation. This evolving pathophysiological understanding parallels a transformation in diagnostic paradigms, where biomarker-based strategies -- such as the AT(N) framework -- enable early disease detection during preclinical or prodromal stages. Within this new landscape, while anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab) represent a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapies, their modest efficacy underscores the limitation of single-target approaches. Therefore, this review explores the compelling rationale for combination therapies that simultaneously target Abeta pathology, aberrant tau, and neuroinflammation. Looking forward, we emphasize emerging technological platforms -- such as gene editing and biophysical neuromodulation -- n advancing precision medicine. Ultimately, the integration of early biomarker detection, multi-target therapeutic strategies, and AI-driven patient stratification charts a promising roadmap toward fundamentally altering the trajectory of AD. The future of AD management will be defined by preemptive, biomarker-guided, and personalized combination interventions.",

      "title": "Cognitive Mirrors: Exploring the Diverse Functional Roles of Attention Heads in LLM Reasoning",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10978v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, but remain largely opaque in terms of their internal mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improve their reasoning abilities. Drawing inspiration from the interplay between neural processes and human cognition, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the roles and behaviors of attention heads, which are key components of LLMs. We introduce CogQA, a dataset that decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions with a chain-of-thought design, each associated with specific cognitive functions such as retrieval or logical reasoning. By applying a multi-class probing method, we identify the attention heads responsible for these functions. Our analysis across multiple LLM families reveals that attention heads exhibit functional specialization, characterized as cognitive heads. These cognitive heads exhibit several key properties: they are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across different cognitive functions, and display interactive and hierarchical structures. We further show that cognitive heads play a vital role in reasoning tasks - removing them leads to performance degradation, while augmenting them enhances reasoning accuracy. These insights offer a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and suggest important implications for model design, training, and fine-tuning strategies.",

      "title": "The Homological Brain: Parity Principle and Amortized Inference",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10976v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Biological intelligence emerges from substrates that are slow, noisy, and energetically constrained, yet it performs rapid and coherent inference in open-ended environments. Classical computational theories, built around vector-space transformations and instantaneous error minimization, struggle to reconcile the slow timescale of synaptic plasticity with the fast timescale of perceptual synthesis. We propose a unifying framework based on algebraic topology, the Homological Brain, in which neural computation is understood as the construction and navigation of topological structure. Central to this view is the Parity Principle, a homological partition between even-dimensional scaffolds encoding stable content ($\\Phi$) and odd-dimensional flows encoding dynamic context ($\\Psi$). Transient contextual flows are resolved through a three-stage topological trinity transformation: Search (open-chain exploration), Closure (topological cycle formation), and Condensation (collapse of validated flows into new scaffold). This process converts high-complexity recursive search (formally modeled by Savitch's Theorem in NPSPACE) into low-complexity navigation over a learned manifold (analogous to memoized Dynamic Programming in P). In this framework, topological condensation is the mechanism that transforms a ``search problem'' into a ``navigation task'', allowing the brain to amortize past inference and achieve rapid perceptual integration. This perspective unifies the Wake-Sleep cycle, episodic-to-semantic consolidation, and dual-process theories (System 1-vs-System 2), revealing the brain as a homology engine that minimizes topological complexity to transmute high-entropy sensory flux into low-entropy, invariant cognitive structure.",
