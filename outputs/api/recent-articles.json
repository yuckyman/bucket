      "title": "Lightweight deep learning models for EEG decoding: a review",
      "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

      "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
      "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",

      "title": "Physiological Arousal as a Predominant Source of Individual Differences in Functional Brain Networks",
      "content": "Individual differences in brain network function and organization are promising targets for fMRI-based biomarkers in precision psychiatry, yet the sources of individual variability remain poorly understood. We show that arousal, assessed by systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) amplitude in the fMRI signal, accounts for a substantial portion of variance in brain network properties (e.g.: R= 0.70 for default mode network (DMN)-dorsal attention connectivity; R= -0.63 for DMN dynamics). These relationships replicated across sessions, across independent samples, and when assessed with traditional arousal indices. Critically, associations persisted after sLFO denoising, indicating a genuine brain-physiology relationship rather than hemodynamic artifact. Pharmacological manipulation showed that drug-induced sLFO-assessed arousal changes were accompanied by corresponding shifts in network connectivity and dynamics. This work identifies arousal as a prominent determinant of variability in functional brain networks, providing a new perspective on brain-based individual differences while offering an approach to measure arousal directly from fMRI data.",

      "title": "Distinct neural temporal architectures encode rapid social expressions and sustained internal mood states",
      "content": "Affective processing operates across multiple temporal scales, from rapid social signaling through facial expressions to sustained internal mood states, yet the neural computational principles governing these different timescales remain unclear. Understanding how the brain implements distinct temporal architectures for momentary versus persistent affective phenomena is important to comprehending emotional processing and developing objective biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. Here, we introduced a multimodal approach combining automated facial expression monitoring and continuous intracranial electroencephalography in 2,037 electrode contacts across 16 epilepsy patients, over multiple days. Of these, 15 and 12 patients met criteria for facial expression and for mood analysis, respectively. Among patients meeting criteria, we captured 1,396 naturalistic smiles, and 3,746 neutral expressions, separated by at least 10 seconds, alongside 336 periodic mood assessments. This paradigm revealed distinct behavioral and neural computational architectures. Aperiodic neural activity in the lateral temporal cortex (79.5% accuracy) encoded facial expressions with high cross-participant generalizability. Mood states, however, showed different encoding patterns. Facial expressions provided no consistent mood indicators across participants. Critically, low-gamma power dynamics in limbic regions encoded mood states in only a subset of individuals (5 of 12 participants) with expression-mood behavioral correlations, suggesting a distinct encoding phenotype. Cross-domain analysis confirmed computational independence: neural features optimized for facial expression decoding failed to predict sustained mood states, and vice versa. These findings suggest that multiple neural mechanisms may influence underlying affective processing, with variations in their contributions between individuals. The results provide a framework for understanding individual differences in neural mood representation and establish methodological approaches for objective measurement of naturalistic affective behaviors.",

      "title": "Single-cell perturbations reveal adaptive, stimulus-dependent recurrence in visual cortex",
      "content": "Cortical processing must adapt dynamically to the strength of sensory inputs, integrating information when signals are weak and refining representations when they are strong. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this adaptation involves recurrent cortical circuits through cooperative amplification and competitive interactions within functional networks. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have begun to support this idea, consistent with novel circuit motifs whereby excitatory and inhibitory cells are strongly connected. Despite these advancements, neither models or data provide a clear picture of the behavior of cortical columns within circuits with functional topography. Here, neighboring cells (excitatory and inhibitory) are selective for similar features in visual space, raising the question as to whether cortical columns act as amplifiers or engage in feature competition. Moreover, columnar network models make a strong prediction: cortical circuits should engage in functional amplification during weak sensory drive, transitioning to suppressive interactions with increasing sensory drive-a prediction not yet directly tested. Using single-cell perturbations in ferret V1, we show that cortical networks switch between amplification and suppression, depending on stimulus strength. Combining two-photon optogenetic stimulation with a generalized linear model (GLM) to quantify perturbations, we uncovered spatially broad suppressive influence modulated by stimulus contrast. At low contrast, we observed amplification between functionally-coupled cells. At high contrast, these networks switched to suppression. This reversal emerged in a recurrent network model with strong inhibitory-excitatory connectivity and weaker excitatory-excitatory connections. This class of models predicts markedly stronger suppressive influences from inhibitory cells onto excitatory populations, which we confirmed with cell-specific perturbations. Our results show that cortical recurrence with functional topography toggles between amplification and suppression, providing direct evidence long-predicted by normative and mechanistic circuit models of visual cortex.",

      "title": "Cortex-wide Dynamics of Internal Decisions About Behavioral Context",
      "content": "Many human decisions manifest in the outside world as motor actions. Correspondingly, neural signals reflecting decision formation are expressed in neural populations encoding the final action. Some decisions, however, are internal, shaping overt behavior indirectly through the selection of policies or rules that guide elementary sensory-motor decisions. We studied the human brain dynamics underlying internal decisions about the stimulus-response mapping rule for reporting visual orientation judgments. The rule changed unpredictably in a hidden fashion, and participants tracked it by accumulating ambiguous sensory cues. Computational model-based decoding of source-level magnetoencephalography data uncovered representations of the internal belief about the active rule in many areas, including occipital cortex. These representations exhibited profiles as predicted by normative models and as observed in action-related frontal areas during overt decisions. We conclude that a widely distributed network of cortical areas implements evidence accumulation for internal decisions, and that even visual cortex may represent high-level beliefs.",

      "title": "Early Post-Stimulus Activity Negatively Predicts P300 Amplitude: A Single-Trial Analysis of the Auditory Oddball Task",
      "content": "The P300 event-related potential is a core index of attention and context updating, yet the trial-by-trial factors that modulate its amplitude remain incompletely characterized. This study tested whether early post-stimulus signal magnitude in the sensory window (0 150 ms) predicts subsequent P300 amplitude (300 600 ms) at the single-trial level. Using data from the ERP CORE auditory oddball dataset (N = 40 participants; 1,661 accepted trials), early activity was quantified as root mean square (RMS) amplitude at electrode Fz. A linear mixed-effects model revealed a statistically reliable negative association between early RMS and P300 amplitude at Pz ({beta} = -0.064, SE = 0.0245, z = -2.61, p = 0.0085). However, early RMS explained minimal trial-level variance (R2 = 0.0042), indicating a modest effect. Model diagnostics confirmed adequate assumptions for inference (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.9995, p = 0.9690). Exploratory complexity measures (permutation entropy, Lempel / Ziv) were not predictive. Because RMS reflects both signal magnitude and within-trial variability, the findings are most conservatively interpreted as evidence that higher early signal energy is associated with slightly reduced P300 amplitude, possibly reflecting resource competition, refractory effects, or state-dependent processing. The results provide methodologically rigorous evidence for a small but reliable coupling between early and late ERP components, while highlighting the importance of distinguishing amplitude-based measures from trial-to-trial variability. Independent replication and control analyses separating mean amplitude from dispersion are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.",

      "title": "Evidence for dimensional representations and anticipatory dynamics in facial expression perception",
      "content": "Expression recognition relies on the ability to distinguish subtle visual differences across a range of facial expressions. Here, we examine the neural representation of dynamic expressions as reflected by electroencephalography (EEG) data in human adults. We find that a wide range of expressions (i.e., 14 emotional and 10 conversational expressions) can be decoded from neural signals, and that their representational structure evinces the classic dimensions of valence and arousal. Critically, we recover, through EEG-based video reconstruction, dynamic representations whose content succeeds in capturing even fine differences across related expressions (e.g., happy-satiated versus schadenfreude). Further, time-resolved decoding reveals anticipatory dynamics that maximize accuracy before the occurrence of an apex expression in the visual stimulus. These results are validated against behavioral data, which yield static reconstructions consistent with their neural counterparts. Thus, our results shed light on the representational basis of expression recognition and serve to recover the dynamic content of visual experience.",

      "title": "Evidence for an Integrated Bilingual Language System from Discourse Tasks in Aphasia",
      "content": "Background: The extent to which bilingual individuals represent and process their two languages within a shared or partially distinct neural architecture remains a topic of ongoing debate. While both parallel and divergent patterns of impairment have been reported in bilingual aphasia, such findings likely reflect a spectrum of representational overlap influenced by dominance, proficiency, and task demands. Critically, few studies have examined how breakdown manifests across multiple levels of linguistic structure using ecologically valid, discourse-based tasks. Aims: This study investigates whether Spanish-English bilinguals with aphasia exhibit parallel or dissociable patterns of impairment across their two languages, focusing on naturalistic narrative production and fine-grained analysis of error types and code-switching. Methods & Procedures: Thirteen bilingual individuals with aphasia following acquired brain injury produced story retellings in both languages. Speech samples were transcribed and coded for phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic errors, and for the word type at which they occurred. Code-switches were also identified and categorized. Analyses included generalized linear modeling and unsupervised clustering. Outcomes & Results: While participants made more errors in their non-dominant language, the structure and distribution of errors were highly similar across languages. Clustering algorithms revealed that impairments were parallel across languages and did not group by language dominance. Code-switching occurred more frequently from the non-dominant to the dominant language, consistent with activation-based lexical selection. Conclusions: Findings support an integrated bilingual language system that spans multiple levels of linguistic representation, modulated by language dominance. Naturalistic discourse tasks allow for richer characterization of bilingual language breakdown and may better inform both theoretical models and clinical management of bilingual aphasia.",
