      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Synapse-related protein alterations and estradiol deficiency associate with early Parkinsonism in female A53T-\u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice fed on a high-fat diet",
      "content": "Substantial evidence highlights the detrimental impact of a fat-rich diet on cognitive and emotional behaviour. Epidemiological studies have linked the consumption of saturated fat with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas a low-fat or ketogenic diet is reported to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms. Several animal model studies further support these associations. However, the impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) on sex-specific behavioural alterations and the underlying molecular mechanism in PD remains poorly studied. In the present study, we investigated the impact of HFD on PD progression in a sex-specific manner using the A53T transgenic mouse model of PD. Behavioural and pathophysiological analyses revealed a faster onset and progression of PD-like phenotype in female mice exposed to HFD compared with the male mice. Proteomics profiling of brain tissues demonstrated positive enrichment of immune system-related pathways in males, while females exhibited considerable downregulation of synapse-associated pathways under HFD conditions. The reduced estradiol level was identified as a potential factor contributing to synaptic dysfunction and the subsequent early onset of PD in female mice. These findings provide novel insights into the sex-specific consequences of HFD on PD pathogenesis and highlight the role of estrogen-linked synaptic vulnerability in mediating diet-induced PD onset.",

      "title": "A\u03b2-42 sidechain deamidation at Q15 and N27 modulate protein aggregation and microglial responses via altered cytokine production and CD68 expression",
      "content": "The progressive aggregation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) monomers into oligomers is a critical factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Although mutated forms of A{beta} have been shown to display altered aggregation dynamics, the specific effects of deamidated A{beta} on microglial function remain understudied. Our research group previously found that the deamidated variant A{beta}-42-N27D modified A{beta} aggregation, reduced neurotoxicity, and reduced microglial reactivity, but the impact of A{beta}-42 side chain deamidation in general on such parameters remained unclear. Here, we expanded on our prior work by investigating how two site-specific A{beta}-42 mutations (Q15E & N27D), where neutral amide side chains are replaced with negatively charged carboxylic acids, affect aggregation and microglial immune response using a mouse microglial cell line. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D exhibit distinct aggregation profiles compared to A{beta}-42 wild type (WT). Multiplexed analysis of 8 cytokines secreted into the culture medium revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MIP-1 relative to A{beta}-42-WT. Immunocytochemistry revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease CD68 expression relative to A{beta}-42-WT. These findings demonstrate that deamidation significantly alters A{beta}-42 aggregation and microglial activation, suggesting structural modifications to A{beta}-42 modulate inflammatory signaling in AD. This work provides a foundation for future studies on A{beta}-42 post-translational modifications as potential therapeutic targets in AD.",

      "title": "Exacerbation of a Subset of Behavioral Phenotypes by Early Treatment with AAV FOXG1 Gene Replacement Therapy in a Mouse Model of FOXG1 Syndrome",
      "content": "FOXG1 syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, profound intellectual disability with communication deficits including lack of speech, impaired social interaction, increased anxiety, hyperkinetic/dyskinetic movements, seizures and abnormal sleep patterns. Mutations in a single allele of the FOXG1 gene cause disease, likely due to loss-of-function. However, current therapies do not target this root cause of FOXG1 syndrome and have little to modest therapeutic benefit on only a small subset of symptoms. Recently, we reported the beneficial effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV) human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection at postnatal day 6 (P6) on several behavioral deficits that are relevant to key features of human FOXG1 syndrome, in male FOXG1 mice that were engineered with a highly prevalent, patient-specific Q84P mutation. Here, we report the behavioral effects of AAV human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by ICV injection in female as well as male mice and at an earlier age - postnatal day 2 (P2). Although the earlier studies had suggested that AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of a subset of functional deficits in human FOXG1 syndrome with no toxicity observations, our current study shows that certain motor behaviors can be negatively impacted or exacerbated by P2 treatment with AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy, in female but not male FOXG1 mice. Given these results, the risk-benefit balance of AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy in patients with FOXG1 syndrome should be carefully considered, especially in female patients.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",
