      "title": "Modeling Temporal Dependencies and Feature Interactions Reveal Novel Clinical and Molecular Insights into Alzheimer's Disease Progression",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease remains a major public health challenge, requiring insights into feature interactions and temporal trends of feature importance. Community-wide data science competitions such as TADPOLE Challenge provide platforms to benchmark predictive models using ADNI datasets. While top performing models achieve accurate predictions, they leave mechanistic questions unresolved. METHODS: We analyzed XGBoost with TreeSHAP for feature interactions and RNN with Integrated Gradients for temporal trends. This two-branch design allows XGBoost to capture nonlinear cross sectional interactions, while RNN captures evolving, time dependent influences. We conducted parallel attribution analyses across full and reduced feature sets, and then fused the outputs from both branches into a unified importance map. This fusion step prioritizes features consistently supported by both static and temporal models. RESULTS: Our framework showed agreement between TreeSHAP and IG, highlighting FAQ, CDRSB, ADAS13, MMSE, and RAVLT variants as the most consistently important features across both branches. Temporal attribution analysis revealed stage dependent trends: in CN, DX:CN, FAQ, and RAVLT_immediate increased in importance; in MCI, MidTemp and WholeBrain gained importance; and in AD, FAQ remained dominant. Feature interaction analysis identified strong clinical-clinical interactions and secondary clinical-molecular interactions. Notably, FAQ and CDRSB repeatedly formed high-strength interaction pairs, while hippocampal and entorhinal volumes contributed secondary molecular modulation, revealing distinct clusters of jointly influential biomarkers. DISCUSSION: This work highlights feature interactions and temporal trends in AD prediction models, offering insights for personalized treatments and patient specific trial designs. Our framework provides stable, cross validated explanations that unify structural and temporal importance, enhancing trustworthiness and mechanistic interpretability in AD modeling.",

      "title": "Testing for Interactions in Multivariate Data",
      "content": "Factorial designs are a mainstay of the scientific paradigm, allowing the effects of multiple experimental factors and their interactions to be efficiently studied within a single experiment. In brain imaging, however, multivariate data analyses commonly proceed using multivariate decoding and we argue that the standard \"difference of accuracies\" test is not a true test of interactions. To remedy this situation we propose an encoding method based on a Bayesian Multivariate Linear model which is ideally suited to the factorial analysis of such data. We show how it can be used to test for multivariate main effects and interactions using data from EEG studies of Reward Learning and Declarative Memory. This approach additionally allows for null hypotheses to be accepted and allows one to infer whether multivariate effects are driven by collections of univariate effects or voxel dependencies. We also propose that those wishing to pursue tests for interactions using decoding methods use an \"accuracy of differences\" test.",

      "title": "Amyloid-\u03b2 42-carrying extracellular vesicles are associated with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated in AD pathology, but their relationship to disease progression and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome remains poorly understood. In this study, we analysed plasma-derived A{beta}42-containing EVs from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and calculated the ratio between the percentage of A{beta}42-positive peripheral EVs and CSF A{beta}42 (rA{beta}42). This ratio was elevated in AD and positively correlated with amyloid pathology as measured by PET. Longitudinal analyses revealed that higher rA{beta}42 values predicted accelerated hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline, independent of CSF A{beta}42 concentrations. Proteomic profiling of CSF using the SomaScan platform showed that rA{beta}42 was associated with an inflammatory signature characterized by myeloid activation and type II interferon-related signalling pathways. Together, these findings indicate that A{beta}42-carrying EVs reflect an active and inflammatory component of AD pathology and may represent a novel class of biomarkers for disease progression. Understanding the mechanisms that link A{beta}42-positive EVs to neuroinflammatory signalling could open new avenues for pathway-specific diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in AD.",

      "title": "Split trial analysis reveals the information capacity of neural population codes",
      "content": "Understanding how correlated neural noise affects neural population coding represents one basic question in computational and systems neuroscience. Recent theoretical work suggest that shared noise along the stimulus encoding direction is the primary factor that limits information encoding (i.e., information-limiting noise). Despite this theoretical insight, it has been difficult to test experimentally due to the challenges in inferring information-limiting noise from neural data. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a method (i.e., split-trial analysis) based on partitioning the neural population response of an individual trial. Results from extensive numerical simulations suggest that split-trial analysis substantially outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Notably, it does so without estimating the noise covariance matrix, which represents a major barrier for prior studies. Applications of split-trial analysis to a number of neurophysiological datasets reveals insights into the precision of the neural codes for several systems. First, it reveals a substantial amount of information-limiting noise in the head direction system in mice. Second, it suggests a small yet positive information-limiting noise in the orientation code in mouse V1. Third, it reveals that the information-limiting noise in the macaque prefrontal cortex is highly consistent over time during a simple saccade task. Split-trial analysis is a general technique that should be widely applicable in analyzing the properties of population codes in the brain.",

      "title": "Proteomic Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease with Psychosis Reveals Separate Molecular Signatures for Core AD Proteinopathy and Postsynaptic Density Disruption",
      "content": "Background and Hypothesis: Alzheimer's disease with psychosis (AD+P) is a subgroup of AD patients with more rapid cognitive deterioration. While our previous study showed that AD+P is associated with loss of prefrontal cortex postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, identifying proteins in the broader cellular environment that influence PSD loss addresses a critical knowledge gap about synaptic dysfunction mechanisms in early disease stages. Study Design: We conducted a proteomic analysis comparing prefrontal grey matter cortex tissue homogenates from elderly normal controls (n=18), individuals with AD+P (n=61), and individuals with AD-P (n=48), all with Braak stages 3-5. Study Results: AD+P showed the most pronounced alterations relative to controls (178 proteins with q<0.05), although alterations in AD-P and AD+P relative to controls were highly similar (R2=0.965, p<0.001). Weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified four modules significantly associated with disease status, comparing AD subjects to controls, but none differed significantly between AD+P and AD-P. We identified 15 proteins significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, including ENPP6, linked to AD+P by GWAS. Additionally, PSD yield-associated proteins showed minimal overlap with altered AD proteins (1 of 137). WGCNA revealed one module significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, enriched for inflammatory terms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a model in which AD+P arises from the combination of quantitative alterations within a shared AD proteome profile and a superimposed set of protein alterations correlated with PSD yield that are largely independent of the shared AD proteome, conferring distinct mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability and psychosis risk.",

      "title": "The developmental emergence of tonic and phasic REM sleep in rats",
      "content": "REM sleep is composed of two substates - phasic and tonic - that differ in their behavioral, sensory, and electrophysiological features. Although these substates are well characterized in adults, their developmental trajectory remains unclear. Here, we examined the development of tonic and phasic REM in rats from postnatal day (P) 12-24, spanning a period of rapid corticothalamic development. We recorded local field potentials and single units from primary motor cortex (M1), together with high-speed video and electromyographic recordings of the nuchal muscle. Periods of behavioral quiescence along with high delta power indicated NREM sleep, whereas periods of sustained muscle atonia and low delta power indicated REM sleep. At P16, M1 theta oscillations first appeared, and the delay to the first twitch increased, revealing the start of a distinct twitch-free portion of REM sleep. Motivated by this, we divided REM sleep into phasic and tonic periods, with and without twitching, respectively. Spiking activity and gamma power were consistently higher during phasic REM. At P20, phasic REM also showed faster theta oscillations than tonic REM. At P24, tonic REM was accompanied by a distinct alpha oscillation. These results show that the features distinguishing the two REM substates appear sequentially across development, revealing a progressive differentiation of REM sleep into tonic and phasic periods, a developmental refinement that may support increasingly complex forms of sleep-dependent plasticity.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all</p> <p>I'm the developer of PyAppExec, a lightweight cross-platform bootstrapper / launcher that helps you distribute Python desktop applications almost like native executables without freezing them using PyInstaller / cx_Freeze / Nuitka, which are great tools for many use cases, but sometimes you need another approach.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Instead of packaging a full Python runtime and dependencies into a big bundled executable, PyAppExec automatically sets up the environment (and any third-party tools if needed) on first launch, keeps your actual Python sources untouched, and then runs your entry script directly.</p> <p>PyAppExec consists of two components: an installer and a bootstrapper.</p> <p>The installer scans your Python project, detects the entry point (supports various layouts such as <code>src/</code>-based or flat modules), generates a <code>.ini</code> config, and copies the launcher (CLI or GUI) into place.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfa5 Short demo GIF:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/hyperfield/pyappexec/blob/v0.4.0/resources/screenshots/pyappexec.gif\">https://github.com/hyperfield/pyappexec/blob/v0.4.0/resources/screenshots/pyappexec.gif</a></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>PyAppExec is intended for developers who want to distribute Python desktop applications to end-users without requiring them to provision Python and third-party environments manually, but also without freezing the app into a large binary.</p> <p>Ideal use cases:</p> <ul> <li>Lightweight distribution requirements (small downloads)</li> <li>Deploying Python apps to non-technical users</li> <li>Tools that depend on external binaries</li> <li>Apps that update frequently and need fast iteration</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison With Alternatives</h1> <p>Freezing tools (PyInstaller / Nuitka / cx_Freeze) are excellent and solve many deployment problems, but they also have trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li>Frequent false-positive antivirus / VirusTotal detections</li> <li>Large binary size (bundled interpreter + libraries)</li> <li>Slower update cycles (re-freezing every build)</li> </ul> <p>With PyAppExec, nothing is frozen, so the download stays very light.</p> <p>Examples:<br /> <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/yt-channel-downloader/files/Binary%20releases/\">Here</a>, the file <code>YTChannelDownloader_0.8.0_Installer.zip</code> is packaged with <code>pyinstaller</code>, takes 45.2 MB; <code>yt-channel-downloader_0.8.0_pyappexec_standalone.zip</code> is 1.8 MB.</p> <h1>Platform Support</h1> <p>Only Windows for now, but macOS &amp; Linux builds are coming soon.</p> <h1>Links</h1> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperfield/pyappexec\">https://github.com/hyperfield/pyappexec</a><br /> SourceForge: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyappexec/files/Binaries/\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyappexec/files/Binaries/</a></p> <h1>Feedback Request</h1> <p>I\u2019d appreciate feedback from the community:</p> <ul> <li>Is this possibly useful for you?</li> <li>Anything missing or confusing in the README?</li> <li>What features should be prioritized next?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading! I'm happy to answer questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ph0tone\"> /u/ph0tone </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pbp679/want_to_ship_a_nativelike_launcher_for_your/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pbp679/want_to_ship_a_nativelike_launcher_for_your/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Over the weekend (leaning heavily on Opus 4.5) I wrote Jargon - an AI-managed zettelkasten that reads articles, papers, and YouTube videos, extracts the key ideas, and automatically links related concepts together.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W7ejMqZ6EUQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/W7ejMqZ6EUQ</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/schoblaska/jargon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/schoblaska/jargon</a><p>You can paste an article, PDF link, or YouTube video to parse, or ask questions directly and it'll find its own content. Sources get summarized, broken into insight cards, and embedded for semantic search. Similar ideas automatically cluster together. Each insight can spawn research threads - questions that trigger web searches to pull in related content, which flows through the same pipeline.<p>You can explore the graph of linked ideas directly, or ask questions and it'll RAG over your whole library plus fresh web results.<p>Jargon uses Rails + Hotwire with Falcon for async processing, pgvector for embeddings, Exa for neural web search, crawl4ai as a fallback scraper, and pdftotext for academic papers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46110897\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46110897</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
