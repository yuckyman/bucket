      "title": "Acute stress reduces risk-aversion by changing magnitude perception",
      "content": "Stress is thought to impair financial decision-making by influencing the willingness to take risks. This effect is commonly attributed to stress-related changes in affective evaluation of rewards and their associated uncertainty. However, existing research has yielded inconsistent findings, and the psychological and neural mechanisms at play remain poorly understood. Here we show that acute psychosocial stress can affect financial risk-taking by altering basic perception of payoff magnitudes, independent of subjective valuation processes. Psychophysical and fMRI modelling reveals that stress reduces risk-aversion without changing choice consistency. A Bayesian perceptual model attributes this effect to an upward shift in prior beliefs about payoff magnitude: Under stress, participants choices are guided by relatively more optimistic beliefs about the risky options. A convergent pattern emerges in parietal neural representations of the payoff magnitudes, which show a systematic upward shift in neural coding as a consequence of the stress manipulation. These findings provide converging neural and behavioral evidence that stress influences financial risk-taking by changing neurocomputational processes related to magnitude perception. This has significant implications for psychological and neuroscience theories of stress and risky behavior, with potential applications to policy and clinical interventions.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",
