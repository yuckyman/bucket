      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "Computer vision-based laser communication system for robust optical beam tracking and alignment",
      "content": "Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a promising technology for high-speed data transmission, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on precise beam alignment. In this work, we present a computer vision-assisted tracking system designed to maintain robust optical alignment in real time. By combining a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Kalman filter, the system can detect the laser spot accurately and adjust the beam direction through a closed-loop feedback mechanism....",

      "content": "Geological storage of carbon dioxide is critical to mitigate emissions; however, subsurface heterogeneity poses a major challenge. This study investigates the Jurassic Plover Formation in the Browse Basin, Northwest Australia, a region underexplored for carbon storage potential. An integrated petrophysical workflow was applied to the Kronos-1 and Poseidon-1 wells, combining borehole logs, petrographic analysis, and core measurements. The workflow included refined porosity-permeability modeling,...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Italian universities showed a growing but uneven commitment to health promotion. Despite frequent references to wellbeing, its integration remains partial and sectoral. This study identified key areas for improvement, such as participation, and highlighted a selection of good practices. These practices offer actionable and replicable models that, through advocacy, can support the development of healthier, more inclusive, supportive university environments.",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Unhealthy behaviors increased incidence of AAMD by 3 to 5-fold among a highly genetically susceptible population, and 56-60% of AAMD incidence was attributed to modifiable factors: smoking, high BMI, high caloric intake and low intake of foods rich in lutein-zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids. Results underscore the importance of lifestyle interventions in high genetic risk populations, such as relatives of affected patients and/or patients with a high GRS, to reduce progression from...",
