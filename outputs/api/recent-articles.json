      "title": "From Hands to Feet: Experience-Driven Plasticity in Secondary Somatosensory Cortex in People Born without Hands",
      "content": "In congenital handlessness, where individuals rely on their feet for compensatory manual functions, reorganization in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) appears limited to local shifts by adjacent body parts. It remains unclear how congenital handlessness and lifelong compensatory foot use shape the sensorimotor system beyond SI, and whether compensatory abilities can drive broader functional reorganization. Here, we used task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how compensatory foot use changes body representations in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in people born without hands (individuals with upper-limb dysplasia, IDs). We found that IDs showed foot selectivity in the left hand-selective SII, with stronger foot activity than typically-developed (TD) control participants during action execution. Notably, this reorganization in the left SII hand area cannot simply be explained by this area's intrinsic organization - the typical secondary preference of this area in the TDs when hand responses are excluded, as this area in TDs shows shoulder - but not foot - selectivity when the hand activity is excluded. This indicates a functional reorganization dependent on the IDs' sensorimotor experience. Resting-state results further revealed altered functional connectivity between SII and primary sensorimotor regions in IDs. Our findings suggest that SII exhibits flexible, experience-dependent plasticity, revealing a hierarchical principle of cortical plasticity, whereby reorganization in the SI is constrained by somatotopic principles while SII reflects functionally or experience-dependent plasticity.",

      "title": "Poorer physical function is associated with elevated spatial entropy in the aging brain network landscape",
      "content": "Life is a constant struggle against disorder. As we age, our ability to maintain internal order declines. In the healthy human brain, order is observable in the form of functionally segregated brain network communities that exhibit spatial consistency. These communities associate with distinct cognitive and physical functions. When mapped into the brain, they form a functional landscape. We assessed the spatial disorder of these landscapes in older adults with a wide range of mobility using a modified version of Shannon entropy. We found that compared to younger adults, older adults had significantly higher entropy in the sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and occipital lobe. Higher entropy in many of these regions was associated with worse physical function and higher body mass index in older adults. Findings suggest that spatial entropy in brain network landscapes may be a marker of declining physical function. Modifiable factors, such as losing excess weight, may help to ameliorate aging-related brain entropy increases in regions such as the sensorimotor cortex, which may in turn help to preserve physical function in older adults.",

      "title": "Motor System Oligodendroglia Atlas Reveals Activation States Associated with Region-Specific Vulnerability in ALS",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes, the second most abundant cell type in the motor cortex and the most abundant in the spinal cord, are increasingly recognized as active contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Yet their diversity and disease relevance in the central nervous system remain incompletely defined. Here, we generate a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of 176 samples, integrating 2 in-house and 16 publicly available datasets. It encompasses more than 1,000,000 cells (350,000 oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors) from the human motor cortex and spinal cord in non-neurological controls and ALS patients. We identify a previously unrecognized oligodendrocyte subpopulation, marked by PPEF1, and uncover regional differences, with distinct OPALIN+ and RBFOX1+ oligodendrocyte proportions between cortex and spinal cord. Importantly, we demonstrate that 'disease-associated oligodendrocytes' (DAOs) represent a distinct activation state, rather than a distinct subpopulation. In ALS, spinal cord oligodendrocytes selectively shift toward reactive states, characterized by JUND-enriched regulon activity, heightened metabolic demand, increased intercellular signaling, and activation of cell-death pathways. Finally, we identify LRP2 as a novel transcriptional oligodendrocyte marker and find LRP2 and MBP proteins to be elevated in ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a potential biomarker of oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Our study provides a systems-level framework to interpret oligodendrocyte and OPC changes in ALS, linking cell state shifts to molecular alterations that can guide biomarker and therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Lysosomal swelling triggers LRRK2 activity",
      "content": "LRRK2 is implicated in lysosomal functions, but the physiological upstream cues that engage endogenous LRRK2 activity are incompletely defined. Here we show that lysosomal swelling serves as a selective and reversible trigger for LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation, without requiring membrane damage. Acute inhibition of PIKfyve, but not the general disruption of phosphoinositide signaling, induces the robust accumulation of phosphorylated Rabs across endolysosomal membranes. Rescue of swelling through pharmacological restoration of lysosomal ionic imbalances from PIKfyve inhibition suppresses LRRK2 activation without restoring lysosomal function. Mechanical lysosomal swelling from indigestible osmolyte uptake causes a dose-dependent increase in LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation on both swollen and non-swollen lysosomes. Together, these findings identify LRRK2 as a sensor of lysosomal volume and mechanical stress, not specifically membrane damage or PIKfyve inhibition. As lysosomal swelling is a shared pathological feature across LRRK2-linked diseases, these results reframe LRRK2 as part of an endolysosomal surveillance system responsive to lysosomal distension.",

      "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
      "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

      "title": "Ischemic stroke induces persistent alteration to brain stromal progenitor cells linked to chronic vascular dysfunction",
      "content": "Fibrotic scar formation after stroke serves a dual role: while essential for providing structural support during post-ischemic recovery, excessive fibrosis in the chronic phase of stroke impairs regenerative processes including axonal regrowth and neovascularization. The temporal dynamics of fibrosis are critical determinants of functional outcomes, as the balance between protective scarring and regenerative capacity differs across distinct stroke phases. Consequently, strategic modulation of fibrotic processes to preserve regenerative potential represents a promising therapeutic approach in stroke recovery. To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this fibrotic response, we investigated stromal progenitor cell composition in the post-stroke brain. The vast majority of stromal progenitor cells (SPCs) are pericytes, with minorities comprising perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) and vascular smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that ischemic stroke drives a long-term shift in this composition, characterized by sustained expansion of the PVF population and excessive laminin deposition in the peri-infarct region-effects that persist for at least six months post-stroke. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed sustained transcriptional and compositional alterations in the SPC population throughout chronic post-stroke phase, driven by AP-1-mediated signaling via TNF in both PVFs and pericytes. These changes correlate with long-term vasomotor dysfunction and capillary constriction in the peri-infarct region at six weeks post-stroke. Ischemic stroke drives aberrant, persistent PVF accumulation at the capillary bed with implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular dysfunction and recurrent stroke. Taken together, these findings reveal that ischemic stroke drives an aberrant long-term mis-localization of PVFs to the capillary bed that may have clinically-relevant implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular function as well as potential ramifications for recurrent stroke.",

      "title": "A Python tool to diagnose how functions behave when inputs are missing (None / NaN)",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>I built a small experimental Python tool called <strong>doubt</strong> that helps diagnose how functions behave when parts of their inputs are missing. I encountered this issue in my day to day data science work. We always wanted to know how a piece of code/function will behave in case of missing data(NaN usually) e.g. a function to calculate average of values in a list. Think of any business KPi which gets affected by missing data. </p> <p>The tool works by: - injecting missing values (e.g. <code>None</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>pd.NA</code>) into function inputs one at a time - re-running the function against a baseline execution - classifying the outcome as: - crash - silent output change - type change - no impact</p> <p>The intent is not to replace unit tests, but to act as a diagnostic lens to identify where functions make implicit assumptions about data completeness and where defensive checks or validation might be needed.</p> <hr /> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is primarily aimed at: - developers working with data pipelines, analytics, or ETL code - people dealing with real-world, messy data where missingness is common - early-stage debugging and code hardening rather than production enforcement</p> <p>It\u2019s currently best suited for relatively pure or low-side-effect functions and small to medium inputs.<br /> The project is early-stage and experimental, and not yet intended as a drop-in production dependency.</p> <hr /> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Compared to existing approaches: - <strong>Unit tests</strong> require you to anticipate missing-data cases in advance; <code>doubt</code> explores missingness sensitivity automatically. - <strong>Property-based testing (e.g. Hypothesis)</strong> can generate missing values, but requires explicit strategy and property definitions; <code>doubt</code> focuses specifically on mapping missing-input impact without needing formal invariants. - <strong>Fuzzing / mutation testing</strong> typically perturbs code or arbitrary inputs, whereas <code>doubt</code> is narrowly scoped to data missingness, which is a common real-world failure mode in data-heavy systems.</p> <hr /> <h3>Example</h3> <p>```python from doubt import doubt</p> <p>@doubt() def total(values): return sum(values)</p> <p>total.check([1, 2, 3]) ```</p> <hr /> <p>Installation</p> <p>The package is not on PyPI yet.
