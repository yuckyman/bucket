      "title": "A Distinct Subpopulation of Extended Amygdala Neurons Drives Food Intake",
      "content": "Background: Neurons in the oval subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) integrate stress and reward signals to regulate motivated behaviors, including food consumption. However, the contribution of specific ovBNST neuronal subpopulations remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) expressing ovBNST neurons using chemogenetics, immunohistochemistry, and viral circuit mapping. Methods and Results: Using stimulatory hM3Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we found that chemogenetic activation of ovBNST Vipr2 neurons significantly increased food intake. We then quantified cFos activation in Vipr2-tdTomato reporter mice following several unique feeding-related manipulations, finding that food restriction (FR) robustly activated ovBNST Vipr2 neurons. Further analysis revealed decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) innervation of the ovBNST following FR, in which reduced VIP expression was significantly associated with greater ovBNST Vipr2 cFos activation. Given previous reports of reduced food intake following stimulation of ovBNST neurons expressing protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}), we used immunostaining to uncover that Vipr2 and PKC{delta} mark largely non-overlapping ovBNST neuronal subpopulations, aligning with their opposing effects on food intake. Finally, Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing revealed that ovBNST Vipr2 neurons project prominently to the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), two feeding-related regions. Conclusions: Together, these results identify ovBNST Vipr2 neurons as a functionally distinct BNST subpopulation that promotes feeding, is activated by food restriction, and links ovBNST neuropeptide signaling to hypothalamic feeding centers.",

      "content": "Investigating the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying food choices has the potential to advance our understanding of eating behaviour and inform health-targeted interventions and policy. Large, publicly available neural and behavioural datasets can enable new discoveries and targeted hypothesis tests, yet no such datasets are currently available. We present the FOODEEG dataset containing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to a diverse array of food images, as well as behavioural measures of food cognition (food categorisation task, food go/no-go task, and food choice task responses), collected from 117 participants. We also provide normative ratings for the food image stimuli with respect to 22 food attributes, including nutritive, hedonic and taste properties, familiarity, and elicited emotions. Our dataset also includes questionnaire-based measures of participants' food motivations, dietary styles, and general motivational tendencies. In the validation analyses, we demonstrate that early food-evoked EEG responses in our dataset are consistent with observations in previous work. The FOODEEG dataset will be valuable for accelerating research into the neural substrates of visual food processing, dietary decisions, and individual differences.",

      "content": "Intermanual transfer refers to the improvement of motor skill in an untrained contralateral limb following unilateral limb practice. However, it remains uncertain whether motor skill in the lower limb (LL) can improve as a result of practice with the unilateral upper limb (UL). Forty-five healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) UL group, which practiced reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left upper limb; or (2) switches observation (SO) group, which observed the same RM sequences; or (3) nature observation (NO) group, which observed nature movies. RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "Multitarget neurostimulation of the deep brain: clinical opportunities, challenges, and emerging technologies",
      "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",
