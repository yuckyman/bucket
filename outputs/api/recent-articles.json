      "title": "State-dependent release of extracellular particles with distinct \u03b12,6-sialylation patterns and small RNA cargo related to neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and related dementias; yet peripheral biomarkers for neuroinflammation remain an unmet medical need. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a dual role in maintaining homeostasis under physiological conditions and driving neuronal damage when chronically dysregulated. One mechanism by which microglia influence their environment is through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and non-vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs), which can serve as biomarkers the reflect cellular states. Here, we systematically isolated and characterized microglia-derived EVs and NVEPs under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions and profiled their small RNA cargo by small RNA sequencing. We validated these findings in human iPSC-derived microglia and further recapitulated them in EVs and NVEPs from mouse brain and plasma. Using an engineered mouse model, we were able to isolate plasma microglia-specific EVs in vivo and demonstrated that their RNA cargo reflects their inflammatory state. Importantly, microglial EVs and NVEPs display distinct a2,6-sialylation patterns and small RNA signatures implicated in neurological diseases. These findings demonstrate that microglia-derived EVs and NVEPs cargo reflect microglial cellular state and establish them as putative minimally non-invasive biomarkers of early-stage neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Upregulation of interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-18 in traumatic brain injury patients and their potential as biomarkers",
      "content": "Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is diagnosed using radiological imaging and biomarker analysis, each with certain limitations. Accurate and accessible detection of TBI is essential for its treatment. Since interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18 are key neuroinflammatory cytokines, we aim to investigate the regulation of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 in TBI patients and assess their potential as biomarkers of TBI. Methods Forty TBI and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was used to assess the clinical severity of TBI. Spearmans rank-order correlation was employed to find the association between GCS scores and IL levels. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human IL-1{beta} and IL-18 ELISA kits was conducted to measure the serum IL-1{beta} and IL-18 levels. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were measured to assess the potential of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 as biomarkers. Results The patients had mild TBI (mTBI) with a mean GCS score of 11.05 {+/-} 1.67. A negative correlation was found between GCS scores and IL levels. IL-1{beta} levels in the TBI and healthy subjects were 1882.19 {+/-} 796.72 pg/mL and 1473.50 {+/-} 333.045 pg/mL, respectively, with a significant difference (p = 0.001). Moreover, the IL-18 levels in TBI subjects (25.92 {+/-} 14.81 ng/L) were also significantly higher (p = 0.000) compared to those of the control group subjects (19.14 {+/-} 2.99 ng/L). The IL-1{beta} exhibited an AUC of 0.72 with 72.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity, at a cut-off point of 1527.25 (pg/mL), while IL-18 had an AUC of 0.78 with 77.5% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity, at a cut-off point of 19.645 (ng/L). Conclusions IL-1{beta} and IL-18 levels were increased remarkably in mTBI patients and exhibited fair potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.",

      "title": "Integration of Nuclear Receptors into a Schwann cell Gene Regulatory Network",
      "content": "Peripheral nerve function depends on the proper formation and maintenance of Schwann cells. During development, large diameter axons are enveloped by single, myelinating Schwann cells whereas clusters of small diameter axons are surrounded by nonmyelinating Schwann cells in Remak bundles. The transcription factor SRY-box 10 (SOX10) is required for the development of Schwann cells, but its functions in different neural crest and glial lineages have shown that SOX10 commonly cooperates with other transcription factors to activate cell-specific gene programs. In a previous study, we compared SOX10-bound regulatory elements in Schwann cells and identified a specific enrichment for nuclear receptor motifs at SOX10 binding sites in Schwann cells. NR2F1 and NR2F2 (Coup-TFI/Coup-TFII) are expressed from neural crest through Schwann cell maturity, and knockdown of nuclear receptors Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 in primary Schwann cells downregulated several myelin genes. In this study, we have identified a NR2F-regulated target gene network in Schwann cells, which revealed enrichment for nonmyelinating Schwann cell genes. Cut&amp;Run assays in S16 Schwann cells revealed novel, genome-wide binding sites of NR2F2 and two downstream transcription factors: 1) Retinoid X Receptor Gamma (RXRG), which is also expressed preferentially in nonmyelinating Schwann cells, and 2) TEA-Domain factor (TEAD1), which is an important HIPPO pathway component required for Remak bundle formation. Our study elucidates the transcriptional cooperation that programs the regulatory network in nonmyelinating Schwann cells.",

      "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
      "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

      "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

      "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

      "title": "Multitarget neurostimulation of the deep brain: clinical opportunities, challenges, and emerging technologies",
      "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",
