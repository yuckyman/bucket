      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "Balancing Efficiency and Compensation: Age-related Theta and Alpha Dynamics in High-load Working Memory",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) declines with age, yet older adults often preserve performance through compensatory mechanisms. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta and alpha bands are central to these adaptations, but their distinct roles across maintenance, manipulation, and recall remain unclear. We examined behavioural and neural differences in WM using electroencephalography (EEG) during verbal (Letter Span) and visuospatial (Corsi Block) tasks under retention and manipulation conditions. Behaviourally, older adults preserved performance in the Letter Span but showed deficits in the Corsi Test, suggesting domain-specific declines, while higher task demands reduced accuracy across both groups. At the neural level, younger adults exhibited stronger mid-frontal and temporal theta activity, supporting more efficient recruitment of WM processes and stronger performance associations. Older adults showed attenuated theta power, indicative of neural saturation, and appeared to compensate through alpha-mediated mechanisms during the delay period (maintenance/manipulation): reduced alpha suppression in the Letter Span facilitated rehearsal and updating, whereas increased upper alpha in the Corsi Test protected stored visuospatial information. These findings suggest theta oscillations underpin core WM functions, whereas alpha oscillations flexibly support compensatory strategies in ageing.",
