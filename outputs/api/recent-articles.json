      "title": "Show HN: A geofence-based social network app 6 years in development",
      "content": "<p>My name is Adrian. I'm a Software Engineer and I spent 6 years developing a perimeter-based geofence-based social media app.<p>What it does:<p>- Allows you to load a custom perimeter anywhere on the geographic map (180\u00b0 E and W longitude and 90\u00b0 N and S latitude), to cover area any area of interest<p>- Chat rooms get loaded within the perimeter<p>- You can chat with people within the perimeter<p>I developed a mobile app that uses an advanced geofence-based networking system from 2013 to 2019. My goal was to connect uses within polygon geofences anywhere in the world. The app is capable of loading millions of polygon geofences anywhere in the world.<p><a href=\"https://enterpriseandroidfoundation.com/assets/images/other/manhattan-polygon-geofences.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://enterpriseandroidfoundation.com/assets/images/other/...</a><p>But people didn't really have a need for this. So after failing, I spent the next 6 years trying to ideas to use FencedIn for. I tried a location-based video app and a place-based app that had multiple features. Nothing worked, but now I'm almost finished developing ChatLocal, an app that allows you to load a perimeter anywhere on the geographic map, which loads chat rooms.<p>The tech stack is 100% Java (low-level mostly). I have a backend, commons library and an Android app. Java was the natural choice back in 2013. However, I still wouldn't choose anything else today. Java is the best for long-term large-scale projects. (I'm also using WildFly. PostgreSQL and a Linux server.)<p>This app is still not fully finished, but I think the impact on society might be tremendous.<p>The previous app to ChatLocal, LocalVideo, is fully up on the Google Play store and can be tested. It has 88% of the features of ChatLocal, including especially the perimeter-based loading system.<p>The feedback I'm mostly looking for is new ideas and concepts to add to this location-based social media app. And how strong of a value proposition does the app have for society.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46546349\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46546349</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "title": "Pooling quantitative MRI data: A multi-protocol study of healthy subcortical ageing",
      "content": "Quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures relaxation rates, exchange rates and proton densities that reflect the biophysical properties of tissue and are ideally free from protocol- and scanner-dependence. In practice, qMRI has not yet achieved this level of independence from sequence and hardware choice, and quantitative measurements often differ across sites and acquisition schemes. At the same time pooling data across different sources can be beneficial to statistical power of longitudinal, cross-sectional or case-control studies. Here we investigate how protocol and hardware differences can affect pooling data from difference sources in large ultra high field (UHF) qMRI studies in the context of healthy aging. We combine the openly available ageing UHF qMRI MP2RAGEME-based dataset with two different MPM-based sets of qMRI data. We evaluate how pooling affects age dependence of qMRI parameters and investigate protocol-related biases, with a particular focus on subcortical structures. We focus the analysis, first, on replication and expansion of the reference qMRI dataset on normative aging, second, the examination of the protocol influence on the measured qMRI values, and third, on detecting the protocol effect on the age dependence inferred from the data. We find that the age-related changes for R1, R2* and volume detected by different protocols were of the same order of magnitude supporting the idea that age-related inter-individual variability can be correctly grasped across sites and protocols using qMRI approaches. We further observe larger relative difference across protocols for R1 and volume, while R2* remains more consistent for most regions. We therefore provide assessment of the pooling effects in the ultra-high resolution UHF qMRI data performed over a relatively large participant cohort, comprising data from different sites collected with different quantitative protocols.",

      "title": "Convergence of Cortical and Thalamic Origins of Free Behavior Modulation of Mouse Primary Visual Cortex",
      "content": "The quality of sensory information flow in the brain may be affected by uninstructed free animal behavior. However, the specific circuit pathways that merge sensory and free behavior remain obscure. In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we combine two-photon calcium imaging of cortical neurons and thalamo-cortical LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) boutons with simultaneous measurements of facial movements. When controlling for spurious time-structured 'nonsense' correlations, we observed representations of both eye movements and non-ocular facial movement features in both LGN bouton and V1 cortical neuron activity during grating input stimulation. Further, the correlation between V1 neurons and facial movement is larger for grating stimulation compared to blank stimulation, likely due to the integration of LGN inputs and modulation of V1 from higher brain centers during grating stimulation. Together, our results suggest a convergence of uninstructed non-visual signals from a persistent top-down pathway and a stimulus-gated bottom-up pathway in primary visual cortex.",
