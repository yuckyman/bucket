Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "Time-resolved X-ray crystallographic analysis of mammalian visual rhodopsin has allowed to visualize the cis-to-trans isomerization of the retinal chromophore, a pivotal event in the early stages of vision, in a temporal and atomic resolution. This achievement provides a foundation for visualizing the subsequent photoreaction dynamics of bovine rhodopsin, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying scotopic vision. However, a critical question remains:...",

      "title": "A reevaluation of the visual phantom illusion and its impact on the motion aftereffect",
      "content": "The constructive nature of motion perception has been highlighted in studies of the visual phantom illusion. Visual phantoms can occur when two low-contrast collinear drifting gratings are separated by a blank gap, leading to the ghostly impression of drifting stripes that extend through the gap. Although previous work has shown that phantom-inducing gratings can elicit a motion aftereffect (MAE) in the gap region, it is not known whether these MAEs arise from the perception of visual phantoms...",
