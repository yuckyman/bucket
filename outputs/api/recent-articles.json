      "title": "Revealing higher-order neural representations of uncertainty with the Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model",
      "content": "arXiv:2503.14333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order\" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order\" representations (HORs), which are ``about\" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs\" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation\" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.",

      "title": "The dynamic interplay between in-context and in-weight learning in humans and neural networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2402.08674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of \"in-context learning\" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.",

      "content": "arXiv:2208.09677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.",

      "title": "Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.",

Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04633v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: My findings show, for the first time, what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioids induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow wave sleep. Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and other medial habenula activators slowdown respiration during SWS and anesthesia. Using DTI method I observed that human hippocampus is connected to MHb via posterior septum, while amygdala via anteromedial BNST. MHb projected to pineal gland and contralateral MHb (Vadovi\\v{c}ov\\'a, 2014). MHb has dense mu-opioids receptors (Gardon and Faget, 2014) and strong projections to IPN. Herkenham (1981) found increased glucose intake during anesthesia in MHb and IPN. The IPN projects to serotonergic MRN/DRN, and pain/interoception/arousal linked PAG. The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? This extended circuit model explains role of the dentate gyrus >posterior septum >MHb >IPN >MRN >hippocampus + BF + claustrum >cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) in memory replay, loss of awareness, anesthesia and SWS. It proposes new neural mechanisms for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN >MRN >claustrum >cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. This brain model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence and wanting. This model suggests that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, cannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, neuropeptide Y, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-proteins production-spines/synapses growth-anti-inflammatory state.",

      "title": "Altered excitability of dI3 neurons regulates hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury is limited in mammals. Reactivation of locomotor circuits does occur, but primarily through the activation of sensorimotor pathways in the context of locomotor training. Previous investigations have shown that dI3 neurons, a developmentally-defined population of pre-motor, glutamatergic interneurons, are indispensable for this process. However, it remains unclear how dI3 neurons are recruited during locomotor recovery, and whether they could be leveraged to improve locomotor function following spinal cord injury. Herein, we investigated how the excitability of dI3 neurons influences locomotor behaviour and recovery after spinal cord injury. In T9-T10 transected mice, we found that acute chemogenetic silencing of dI3 neurons leads to immediate loss of hindlimb motor tone, and significant reduction in stepping during treadmill locomotion. Conversely, regular chemogenetic stimulation of dI3 neurons led to transient increases in hindlimb motor tone early after injury, but ultimately reduced hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery over the long term. These chronic changes resulting from dI3 neuron stimulation were associated with the absence of expression of the constitutive 5-HT2C-R isoform, potentially representing a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of dI3 excitability following spinal cord injury. Given these findings, we hypothesized that dI3 stimulation effects on motor tone, while insufficient to drive locomotor function alone, may promote stepping improvements when locomotor rhythm-generating circuits are active. The addition of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist known to facilitate locomotor rhythmogenesis, in combination with dI3 stimulation, significantly improved locomotor function, while also mitigating the long-term reduction in treadmill stepping associated with dI3 stimulation alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that hyper-excitable dI3 neurons are involved in the maintenance of motor tone after spinal cord injury, possibly through a 5-HT2C-R-dependent mechanism, and further show that the selective stimulation of dI3 neurons could enhance the recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury.",

      "content": "Objective. Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, achieving effective seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetic techniques has proven challenging. This difficulty can be attributed to a suboptimal stimulation method that involves numerous complex variables. This study aims to examine how various stimulation parameters and opsin characteristics influence the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition protocols. Additionally, a new opsin model is introduced that permits easy implementation of the experimentally derived parameters describing the opsin\u2019s opening and closing dynamics. Approach. The mathematical description of a chloride and potassium conducting opsin was combined with a conductance-based model of a pyramidal CA1 neuron. Simulations with varying parameters were conducted to explore the effects of the stimulation paradigm and the neuronal environment on inhibition. A simplified, adaptable opsin model was used to test the robustness of these results and explore the impact of variations in opsin characteristics. Main results. Stronger inhibition was achieved with higher illumination intensities, pulse repetition frequencies, and duty cycles. Potassium conducting opsins were found to be more stable than chloride conducting ones. These findings were independent of the opsin\u2019s parameters. Additionally, changes in the opsin\u2019s dynamics had negligible impact when the opening and closing time constants were varied by factors between 0.5 and 2. Significance. This study provides key insights into the stimulation and physiological parameters that affect optogenetic inhibition. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right stimulation protocol and opsin for optimizing optogenetic strategies. The newly developed opsin model also offers a new, valuable tool that will facilitate future research into the development of an improved optogenetic modulation protocol for seizure suppression.",

At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation-induced local evoked potentials outperform spectral features in spatial and clinical STN mapping",
      "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

      "title": "Refining signal localization: a transcranial magnetic stimulation motor mapping approach to functional near-infrared spectroscopy",
      "content": "Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising brain imaging tool due to its cost-effectiveness and balance between spatial and temporal resolution. However, its reliance on the 10-20 EEG coordinate system for probe placement introduces potential inaccuracies in cortical localization. Despite concerns regarding its spatial precision, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with fNIRS for validating signal localization has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the interindividual variability in hand motor representations and how it influences the precision of fNIRS recordings during motor tasks. Approach. Neuronavigated TMS was employed on 18 neurotypical adults to map the motor representations of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and fourth dorsal interosseous (4DI) muscles. Center-of-gravity (CoG) coordinates from TMS-evoked motor maps were compared with fNIRS channel locations, including the theoretical hand channel defined by the 10-20 EEG system. FNIRS signals were recorded during a hand-grasp motor task, and the subject-specific hand channel was determined by identifying the fNIRS channel closest to the individual\u2019s TMS CoG. Main Results. TMS motor mapping revealed substantial interindividual variability, with 56% of participants demonstrating deviations from the theoretical fNIRS hand channel. TMS motor maps showed that the FDI and 4DI representations were closely positioned, with the 4DI representation slightly anterior to the FDI (p = 0.022). Analysis of fNIRS signals indicated that subject-specific hand channels exhibited significantly higher hemodynamic response amplitudes compared to the theoretical hand channel (p = 0.0004), suggesting enhanced signal sensitivity when using individualized cortical mapping. Additionally, fNIRS signal variance was significantly higher in the theoretical channel, indicating greater signal variability and lower signal robustness. Significance. These findings highlight the limitations of rigidly applying the 10-20 EEG system for spatial localization in fNIRS-based motor studies and show the benefits of integrating TMS-derived cortical mapping for improved signal accuracy and robustness.",

      "title": "Towards stimulation-free automatic electrocorticographic speech mapping in neurosurgery patients",
      "content": "Objective. The precise mapping of speech-related functions is crucial for successful neurosurgical interventions in epilepsy and brain tumor cases. Traditional methods like electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) are effective but carry a significant risk of inducing seizures. Methods. To address this, we have prepared a comprehensive ESM\u2009+\u2009electrocorticographic mapping (ECM) dataset from 14 patients with chronically implanted stereo-EEG electrodes. Then we explored several compact machine learning (ML) approaches to convert the ECM signals to the ground truth derived from the risky ESM procedure. Both procedures involved the standard picture naming task. As features, we used gamma-band power within successive temporal windows in the data averaged with respect to picture and voice onsets. We focused on a range of classifiers, including XGBoost, linear support vector classification (SVC), regularized logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, multi-Layer perceptron, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers and equipped them with confidence interval estimates, crucial in a real-life application. We validated the ML approaches using a leave-one-patient-out procedure and computed ROC and Precision\u2013Recall curves for various feature combinations. Results. For linear SVC we achieved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, which effectively distinguishes speech-related from non-related iEEG channels. We have also observed that the use of information on the voice onset moment notably improved the classification accuracy. Significance. We have for the first time rigorously compared the ECM and ESM results and mimicked a real-life use of the ECM technology. We have also provided public access to the comprehensive ECM+ESM dataset to pave the road towards safer and more reliable eloquent cortex mapping procedures.",

      "title": "Instantaneous recognition method for lower limb continuous motion based on onset-window surface electromyography data",
      "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

      "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
      "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

      "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",
