      "title": "Launch HN: Constellation Space (YC W26) \u2013 AI for satellite mission assurance",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN! We're Kamran, Raaid, Laith, and Omeed from Constellation Space. We built an AI system that predicts satellite link failures before they happen (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/069V9fADAtM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/069V9fADAtM</a>).\nBetween us, we've spent years working on satellite operations at SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA. At SpaceX, we managed constellation health for Starlink. At Blue, we worked on next-gen test infra for New Glenn. At NASA, we dealt with deep space communications. The same problem kept coming up: by the time you notice a link is degrading, you've often already lost data.<p>The core issue is that satellite RF links are affected by dozens of interacting variables. A satellite passes overhead, and you need to predict whether the link will hold for the next few minutes. That depends on: the orbital geometry (elevation angle changes constantly), tropospheric attenuation (humidity affects signal loss via ITU-R P.676), rain fade (calculated via ITU-R P.618 - rain rates in mm/hr translate directly to dB of loss at Ka-band and above), ionospheric scintillation (we track the KP index from magnetometer networks), and network congestion on top of all that.<p>The traditional approach is reactive. Operators watch dashboards, and when SNR drops below a threshold, they manually reroute traffic or switch to a backup link. With 10,000 satellites in orbit today and 70,000+ projected by 2030, this doesn't scale.\nOur system ingests telemetry at around 100,000 messages per second from satellites, ground stations, weather radar, IoT humidity sensors, and space weather monitors. We run physics-based models in real-time - the full link budget equations, ITU atmospheric standards, orbital propagation - to compute what should be happening. Then we layer ML models on top, trained on billions of data points from actual multi-orbit operations.<p>The ML piece is where it gets interesting. We use federated learning because constellation operators (understandably) don't want to share raw telemetry. Each constellation trains local models on their own data, and we aggregate only the high-level patterns. This gives us transfer learning across different orbit types and frequency bands - learnings from LEO Ka-band links help optimize MEO or GEO operations.\nWe can predict most link failures 3-5 minutes out with >90% accuracy, which gives enough time to reroute traffic before data loss. The system is fully containerized (Docker/Kubernetes) and deploys on-premise for air-gapped environments, on GovCloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government), or standard commercial clouds.<p>Right now we're testing with defense and commercial partners. The dashboard shows real-time link health, forecasts at 60/180/300 seconds out, and root cause analysis (is this rain fade? satellite setting below horizon? congestion?). We expose everything via API - telemetry ingestion, predictions, topology snapshots, even an LLM chat endpoint for natural language troubleshooting.<p>The hard parts we're still working on: prediction accuracy degrades for longer time horizons (beyond 5 minutes gets dicey), we need more labeled failure data for rare edge cases, and the federated learning setup requires careful orchestration across different operators' security boundaries.\nWe'd love feedback from anyone who's worked on satellite ops, RF link modeling, or time-series prediction at scale. What are we missing? What would make this actually useful in a production NOC environment?<p>Happy to answer any technical questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46721933\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46721933</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "A fast and simple algorithm for accurate spike detection in HD-MEA recordings",
      "content": "Background: High density microelectrode arrays provide a strong platform to study individual neuronal activity and neuronal network dynamics. However, the analysis of high volume and complex data present several challenges. Common spike detection methods based on Root-Mean-Square (RMS) threshold crossing underestimate the number of spikes during neuronal bursting, which frequently occurs in neuronal cultures. In addition, the detection of action potentials by multiple electrodes makes spikes sorting a computationally expensive task. New Method: We optimized a previously described detection method, based on the scaled median of absolute deviations (MED) that is more accurate during high rates of neuronal firing. In addition, we added a step to de-duplicate (DP) spikes recorded on multiple electrodes, which enhanced the accuracy of MED. The combined method of detection and de-duplication (DP-MED) is less computationally expensive and easier to implement than popular sorting alternatives like Kilosort-4. Results and Conclusions: During burst periods, the MED-based method detected over half of spikes that were undetected by the RMS-based method. To evaluate the performance of DP-MED, we simulated data that emulates neuronal activity recorded with HD-MEA. Across increasing firing rates, DP-MED shows more precision than Kilosort-4 but is slightly less accurate. After inducing high firing rate in cortical cultures with pharmacological stimulation, DP-MED detected a similar number of spikes than Kilosort-4, however, the analysis in Kilosort-4 was 40-fold more time-consuming. These results highlight the effectiveness of the DP-MED method in the context of drug screening using HD-MEAs.",

      "title": "A neuronal pathway for the supraspinal relay of warm and cool sensation",
      "content": "Cutaneous thermosensation is a fundamental sense allowing discrimination of external temperature changes and driving adaptive responses essential for survival and well-being. This sensory process begins with the activation of peripheral thermoreceptors, which encode the quality and intensity of thermal stimuli into neuronal activity that is further integrated by spinal cord circuits and relayed to supraspinal centres through the anterolateral tract (ALT). While classical experiments identified thermal responsive ALT neurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn, the functional logic of innocuous temperature relay remains poorly understood. We show that, in mice, the majority of Phox2a-lineage lamina I ALT are selectively tuned to innocuous warming or cooling, and receive direct inputs from peripheral thermoreceptors. Their genetic ablation, chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulation impaired temperature discrimination. Our findings contrast with the previous finding that the majority of ALT neurons being mechano- and thermo-nociceptive and provide novel evidence for the existence of a large ensemble of genetically defined warming- and cooling- responsive ALT neurons. The large representation of innocuous temperature in supraspinal-relaying ALT neurons indicates substantial spinal amplification of thermal information and underscores the importance of innocuous thermosensation in the ascending sensory pathway.",
