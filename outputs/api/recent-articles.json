      "content": "The study of a nervous system as big as the cephalopod requires multimodal imaging approaches capable of capturing neural architecture across scales. Here, we present a whole-animal volume of the pygmy squid hatchling Idiosepius hallami, acquired using X-ray holographic nanotomography at the beamline ID16A of the European Synchrotron. The reconstructed 3D volume comprises 40 tiled scans acquired at a voxel size of 125 nm. While individual neurons are not resolved at this resolution, we segmented major body regions and mapped the large-scale connectivity by tracing afferent and efferent nerve bundles, including projections from the olfactory organs, chromatophore lobes, and arm ganglia to the brain. The acquisition of this dataset represents a significant milestone for X-ray nanotomography, being the largest whole animal volume imaged at this spatial resolution. The volume serves as a resource for comparative neuroscience and cephalopod biology.",

      "title": "Optimal configuration of on-scalp OPMs with fixed channel counts",
      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Small object detection is an essential but challenging task in computer vision. Transformer-based algorithms have demonstrated remarkable performance in the domain of computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, they suffer from inadequate feature extraction for small objects. Additionally, they face difficulties in deployment on resource-constrained platforms due to their heavy computational burden. To tackle these problems, an efficient local-global fusion Transformer (ELFT) is proposed for small...",

Despite this promise, many AI applications remain confined to scientific research rather than being integrated into everyday clinical practice. This manuscript aims to help intensivists prepare themselves and their intensive care units (ICUs) for AI implementation. It provides a comprehensive yet practical roadmap,...",

The substantial loss of reading speed suggests that mesopic near vision is impaired. Low luminance reading speed is a practical, patient-relevant endpoint and should be considered in IOL evaluations.",
