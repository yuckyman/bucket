      "title": "Drinking microstructure analysis of direct controls of water intake in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Measures of rodent drinking (lick) patterns are used to test how various manipulations affect fluid intake. Decades of research indicate that manipulating the satiating potency of a stimulus affects the number of licking bursts whereas manipulating the hedonic value of the solution affects the size of the licking bursts or rate of licking. This type of analysis has been largely applied to manipulations that modulate drinking that is already occurring (i.e., indirect controls or modulators of intake), but there is a dearth of studies with detailed measures of licking in response to stimuli that are primary drivers of intake (i.e., direct controls). A better understanding of licking behavior in response to direct controls of fluid intake could provide insight into how drinking is stimulated. Accordingly, we analyzed lick patterns after varying doses of primary drivers (direct controls) of intake, angiotensin II, hypertonic saline, or carbochol, in male and female rats. As expected, all treatments dose-dependently increased licks for water. Analysis of licking patterns revealed dose-related increases in burst number after treatment with all stimuli, but dose did not predict burst size or lick rate. Together with previous work on licking patterns these data suggest that direct controls of water intake are more related to processes associated with satiety than to changes in hedonic value of the consumed substance.",

      "title": "Retinal Origins of Circadian Photoregulation's Specialized Dynamic Range and Temporal Integration",
      "content": "The circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate environmental changes that are driven by the earth's rotation, and synchronizes with this cycle using ligh1. The clock extracts relevant parameters of illumination, responding selectively to intensities at twilight and above, and to the number of photons counted over an extended time window2-8. These hallmark properties are thought to manifest in the brain9. Here, we report that they emerge within specific neurons of the eye. These M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) detect light directly, using a receptor called melanopsin, and indirectly, through circuits driven by rod and cone photoreceptors10. We find that the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic drives varies widely across M1s, and the population accounts for the dynamic range of circadian photoregulation. Both singly and collectively, M1s approach the level of temporal integration observed behaviorally. The cellular and behavioral levels match when the pupillary light reflex--another M1-driven function--shapes the light that M1s receive. This work reveals how the first steps of sensory processing are precisely formatted for specific tasks. It also introduces bioluminescence-based methods for identifying photosensitive neurons without desensitization, allowing their mechanistic study under physiological conditions.",

      "title": "Lateralized foraging induces asymmetric corticostriatal plasticity in mice",
      "content": "With practice, animals perform reward-oriented actions faster and with less variability. The dorsal striatum (DS) plays a key role in this process, potentially through opposing changes in cortical input strength to the two main striatal projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs). To test this hypothesis, we trained mice in a foraging task requiring them to perform quarter-turns (QTs) in a single direction (counterclockwise, CCW) along the walls of square towers to collect drops of water. As training progressed, the number and speed of CCW QTs increased while the variability of their trajectory decreased. Whisker trimming in well-trained mice altered QTs kinematics, highlighting the role of tactile inputs in guiding these actions. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DS with glutamate uncaging in the barrel cortex, we mapped the cortical neurons monosynaptically connected to D1- or D2-SPNs and measured the strength of these connections in the contralateral hemispheres, relative to the turn direction. In well-trained mice, compared to naive controls, the contralateral hemisphere showed no major changes in D1- or D2-SPNs connectivity, despite increased excitation of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the ipsiversive hemisphere exhibited no change in cortical excitability but showed increased cortical connectivity and input strength to SPNs. These findings reveal an unexpected hemispheric asymmetry in corticostriatal connectivity during lateralized foraging, which may reflect a homeostatic process normalizing striatal activity across hemispheres despite unbalanced cortical input.",

      "title": "Real-time Bayesian optimization of deep brain stimulation for personalized cognitive control enhancement",
      "content": "Background: Identifying effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters for psychiatric disorders has historically been a time-consuming and error prone process due to a lack of an objective and rapid readout of target circuit engagement. Cognitive control may have use as a biomarker of treatment efficacy but it has yet to be shown that DBS parameters can be reliably optimized to produce cognitive control improvements in individual subjects. Objective: We sought to leverage a rat model of DBS-driven cognitive control improvements to determine whether state of the art optimization algorithms could consistently identify effective stimulation amplitudes to enhance cognition. Methods: We delivered periods of active and inactive DBS-like stimulation at variable parameters while rats performed a Set-Shifting task that we previously showed to be stimulation-sensitive. We tested both predefined settings of interest and settings that were personalized to individual animals using Bayesian Optimization. Measurements of task performance including reaction time and accuracy were compared between acute, optimized, and traditional settings to evaluate effects on cognitive control. Results: Acute stimulation reduced reaction times without hindering accuracy (N=15), replicating the effects previously observed with chronic stimulation. In a second cohort (N=6), optimization of stimulation amplitude successfully reduced reaction times in all animals with comparable effect size to historically best settings. Conclusion: These findings confirm that optimization techniques can be effective for improving symptomatically-relevant cognitive markers supporting the feasibility of personalized, quantitatively-informed approaches to neuromodulation and target engagement for psychiatric and/or cognitive disorders.",

      "title": "Inducible CreERT2 mouse lines for characterization of retinal bipolar cell subtypes",
      "content": "Bipolar cells relay visual signals from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells in the retina. Fifteen bipolar cell subtypes have been identified in the mouse retina. These subtypes are classified as ON and OFF bipolar cells based on their response to light stimulus or rod and cone bipolar cells based on their connection to photoreceptor cells. However, the unique structural and functional role of these subtypes in the processing of visual information is not fully known due to the inadequate tools and models available for their characterization. In this study, to trace the lineage and characterize Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4-expressing bipolar cell subtypes in developing and adult mouse retina, we developed inducible Cre lines under the promoter of Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 and crossed them with ChR2EYFP reporter mice. Lineages of cells expressing Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 after Cre induction in the adult and postnatal mouse retina were then characterized. ChR2EYFP expression driven by Vsx1-CreERT2 was detected in type 2, 6, and 7 bipolar cells, Lhx3-CreERT2 in type 1b, 2, and 6 bipolar cells, and Lhx4-CreERT2 in type 2, 3, 4, and 5 bipolar cells as well as cone photoreceptor cells in the adult mouse retina. These bipolar cell subtype-specific inducible Cre mouse lines serve as efficient tools for elucidation of the mechanisms that control bipolar cell subtype development and function in the retina.",
