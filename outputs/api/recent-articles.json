      "title": "A Reference Atlas of the Human Dorsal Root Ganglion",
      "content": "Somatosensory perception largely emerges from diverse peripheral sensory neurons whose cell bodies reside in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Damage or dysfunction of DRG neurons is a major cause of chronic pain and sensory loss. In mice, deep single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetically defined models have offered important clues into DRG function, but in humans, the cellular and molecular landscape of DRG neurons remains less understood. Here, we constructed a reference cell atlas of the human DRG by profiling transcriptomes of cells and nuclei from 126 donors sampled across cervical, thoracic, and lumbar DRGs. This atlas resolves 22 neuronal subtypes, including known and previously unrecognized subtypes linked to nociception, mechanosensation, thermosensation, and proprioception, as well as 10 types of non-neuronal cells. Cross-species integration, spatial transcriptomics, and microneurography enabled cell-type-specific comparisons of soma size and conduction velocity between species. Human DRG somata are larger across all cell types than their mouse counterparts, and the conduction velocities of human hair follicle innervating A-fibers are faster than in mice, suggesting a functional shift in rapid mechanical detection in humans. This integrated human DRG reference cell atlas provides a resource for exploring new molecular and physiological features of human DRG, which could help identify new strategies for treating chronic pain and other diseases of the peripheral nervous system.",

      "content": "HIV-1 infection affects approximately 38.4 million people around the world. The advent of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly improved the quality of life of infected individuals; however, roughly 50% of these individuals will still experience HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Additionally, the gastrointestinal microbiome has been reported to be dysbiotic in HIV-1 infected individuals, regardless of adherence to cART. Current research has pointed to the gut-brain-microbiota axis as a potential target to treat both cognitive deficits and microbial changes. The present study investigated S-Equol (SE) as a potential therapeutic for HAND by modulating the gastrointestinal microbiome. The study included 21 HIV-1 Tg rats and 21 F344 control animals to test the effect 0.2mg SE has on cocaine-maintained responding on a PR schedule of reinforcement. Gastrointestinal microbiome alterations between genotypes were found at the phylum and genus level, regardless of treatment group, and SE treatment had both main effects and interactions with genotype. Prevotella_UCG_001 was significantly associated with lever presses for drug, suggesting an effect on motivation for cocaine. Alloprevotella was found to significantly differentiate between genotype by treatment effects, indicating that SE differently affects genotypes.",

      "title": "Mini-Pcdh15b Gene Therapy Rescues Visual Deficits in a Zebrafish Model of Usher Syndrome Type 1F",
      "content": "Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) is a severe inherited disorder caused by mutations in PCDH15, resulting in congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and progressive retinal degeneration leading to blindness. While cochlear implantation can restore hearing, no therapeutic interventions currently exist for vision loss. Gene augmentation therapy represents a promising approach; however, the PCDH15 coding sequence (~5.3 kb) exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. To overcome this limitation, we previously engineered shortened \"mini-PCDH15\" constructs that retain key structural and functional domains while fitting within a single AAV. Among these, the mini-PCDH15-V4 variant successfully restored hearing in Pcdh15-deficient mice. Here, we investigated the ability of a cone-targeted mini-pcdh15b-V4 transgene to rescue vision in a zebrafish model of USH1F. Untreated pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish exhibited severe structural and functional defects of the retina, including disorganized and shortened photoreceptor outer segments, disrupted calyceal processes, and markedly reduced electroretinogram (ERG) and optokinetic response (OKR) performance. Targeted expression of mini-pcdh15b-V4 recapitulated typical localization of Pcdh15b to calyceal processes and outer segment membranes, rescued photoreceptor architecture, and re-established both structural organization and functional output. Treated mutants exhibited improved visual tracking behavior and full recovery of ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, indicating restoration of photoreceptor and synaptic function. Importantly, mini-pcdh15b-V4 expression produced no adverse effects in wild-type or heterozygous fish, supporting the safety of cone-specific expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that mini-pcdh15b-V4 can restore both photoreceptor structure and visual function in pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish. This work establishes the pcdh15b mutant zebrafish as a powerful preclinical model for studying USH1F retinopathy and supports the translational potential of rationally engineered mini-PCDH15 constructs as a feasible gene therapy approach for preventing or reversing vision loss in individuals with USH1F.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "title": "The time-varying brain: a comprehensive review of dynamic functional connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG",
      "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

      "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
      "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",
