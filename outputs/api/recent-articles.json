      "title": "Spontaneous perceptual reversals are accompanied by systematic changes in pupil size but not respiration phase",
      "content": "Humans tend to align their respiration with important events, in line with the notion that respiration serves as a tool to allocate (neuro-)physiological resources. This respiration alignment is consistently reported in laboratory studies relying on sequences of stimulus-driven experimental trials. However, whether such respiration alignment also occurs in the absence of external cues - such as during spontaneous perceptual changes - remains unknown. However, pupil size is known to change around spontaneous changes in perception, and pupil size supposedly covaries with respiration phase, suggesting that indeed respiration may align to spontaneous changes in perception. We investigate the link between respiration, pupil size, and spontaneous perceptual changes while participants (n=21) reported spontaneous perceptual reversals while viewing an ambiguous Necker cube. We confirmed the biphasic modulation of pupil size around reversals (constriction followed by dilation) and the general variation of pupil size with respiration phase. However, this coupling of pupil size and respiration phase broke down around perceptual reversals. Crucially, our data reveal no clear alignment of respiration phase to perceptual reversals although respiration frequency was predictive of the perceptual stability duration. These findings suggest that the temporal predictability of external events is critical for the robust respiration alignment to cognitive events.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Proteomic Profiling Defines Robust Molecular Subtypes Underlying the Heterogeneity of Parkinson's Disease",
      "content": "Heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is a barrier to developing therapeutics and understanding progression and prognosis. High throughput proteomic measures can be used to better interpret PD pathophysiology and generate clusters to define disease subtypes. Identification of subtypes related to clinical phenotypes will help researchers understand PD progression. We analyzed longitudinal proteomic data from the Tracking Parkinson's Cohort, consisting of recent-onset PD patients across 72 UK sites. 794 patients were measured on the Somalogic platform (7596 proteins) for three time points. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) at each time point revealed consistent protein co-expression modules. Two modules were strongly preserved across all three time points and in validation in the Global Neurodegenerative Proteomics Consortia (GNPC) datasets. The brown module was enriched for metabolite pathways and the blue module with cellular signaling pathways and associated with quality of life scores. Conversely, the smaller red module had distinct cognitive function phenotypes and changed protein expression between visit time points. Using detailed characterization of proteomic clusters we have provided a comprehensive view of PD progression offering deeper insights into the conservation of proteomic expression, suggesting new module subsets and providing candidate target proteins for further study.",

      "title": "Concurrent saliency and intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex",
      "content": "The goal for the motor action represents the desired state of the individual to interact with world. Investigating how the goal is generated requires clarifying spatial extrapolation that involves perceptual and action processes. Here, we recorded neural activity from monkeys manually intercepting a circularly moving target being occluded. The saliency and intentional maps, which developed to locate the target of interest and the intended action goal, were thus distinguished in neural activity recorded from the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) and parietal reach region (PRR). Dynamic internal representations spanning from visual registration to state estimation were unveiled in both areas, with the goal for the interception being inferred as the visual consequence of the movement. The motion extrapolation was found to be an intrinsic part of movement planning so that the continuous and stable spatial extrapolation from motion to action was prevalent in both areas. The goal estimation based on the sensory extrapolation rationalized the concurrency and correlation of saliency and intentional maps, which were found to switch their dominance by reorganizing the read-out dimensions of the spatial manifold. The extrapolation achieved at both the perceptual and motor stages not only bridged the saliency and intentional maps, but also revealed the form of the state estimation in guiding predictive sensorimotor control.",
