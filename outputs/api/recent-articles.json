      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "content": "Background: Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents (ZES) are increasingly used off-label for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). However, foundational, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant preclinical safety data specific to the cerebral vasculature is lacking. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic evaluation of the technical feasibility, anatomic features, and 30-day clinical safety profile of the Onyx Frontier ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in a GLP-compliant canine intracranial model. Methods: In a prospective GLP study, a 2.0 x 8.0 mm Onyx Frontier ZES was implanted in the basilar artery of twelve healthy mongrel canines pre-treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Vertebral artery tortuosity was assessed via angiography and graded as Type I (non-tortuous/straight), Type II (moderately tortuous/S-shaped), or Type III (severely tortuous/coiled). The primary endpoints were procedural success and 30-day safety, assessed via angiography, serial neurological examinations, and comprehensive clinical monitoring. Results: Technical success was achieved in 100% of animals (12/12). The cohort exhibited challenging anatomy, with a mean basilar artery diameter of 1.39 {+/-} 0.10 mm. Tortuosity analysis revealed that 33.3% of animals were Type I (mild), 58.3% were Type II (moderate), and 8.3% were Type III (severe). Post-procedure, mild vasospasm was observed in all cases, with only one canine requiring intra-arterial verapamil. A single case (8.3%) of self-limiting contrast extravasation occurred without clinical sequelae. At 30 days, there was no mortality, and no animals suffered a neurological adverse event. Minor clinical events were unrelated to the device, and comprehensive clinical pathology panels revealed no evidence of systemic toxicity or a significant inflammatory response. Conclusion: This first-of-its-kind preclinical study demonstrates that implantation of the Onyx Frontier ZES is technically feasible with a 100% success rate in a sub-2mm vessel model with significant tortuosity and has an excellent 30-day safety profile with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity. These findings provide foundational preclinical data supporting further investigation of this technology for treating ICAD in human subjects.",
