      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I recently caught 2 cases, 1 criminal and 1 civil and I realized how incredibly difficult it is for the average person to find a suitable lawyer for their specific situation. There's two ways the average person look for a lawyer, a simple google search based on SEO ( google doesn't know to rank attorneys ) or through connections, which is basically flying blind. Trying to navigate court systems to actually see an attorney\u2019s track record is a nightmare, the portals are clunky, slow, and often require manual searching case-by-case, it's as if it's built by people who DOESN'T want you to use their system.</p> <p>So, I built CourtScrapper to fix this.</p> <p>It\u2019s an open-source Python tool that automates extracting case information from the Dallas County Courts Portal (with plans to expand). It lets you essentially &quot;background check&quot; an attorney's actual case history to see what they\u2019ve handled and how it went.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <ul> <li>Multi-Attorney Search: You can input a list of attorneys and it searches them all concurrently.</li> <li>Deep Filtering: Filters by case type (e.g., Felony), charge keywords (e.g., &quot;Assault&quot;, &quot;Theft&quot;), and date ranges.</li> <li>Captcha Handling: Automatically handles the court\u2019s captchas using 2Captcha (or manual input if you prefer).</li> <li>Data Export: Dumps everything into clean Excel/CSV/JSON files so you can actually analyze the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li>The average person who is looking for a lawyer that makes sense for their particular situation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Enterprise software that has API connections to state courts e.g. lexus nexus, west law </li> </ul> <p><strong>The Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Playwright (for browser automation/stealth)</li> <li>Pandas (for data formatting)</li> </ul> <p><strong>My personal use case:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Gather a list of attorneys I found through google</li> <li>Adjust the values in the config file to determine the cases to be scraped</li> <li>Program generates the excel sheet with the cases for the listed attorneys</li> <li>I personally go through each case to determine if I should consider it for my particular situation</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019d love for you guys to roast my code or give me some feedback. I\u2019m looking to make this more robust and potentially support more counties.</p> <p>Repo here:<a href=\"https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper\">https://github.com/Fennzo/CourtScrapper</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlikely90\"> /u/Unlikely90 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1peelsy/i_built_an_automated_court_scraper_because/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Ventromedial striatal dopamine dynamically integrates motivated action and reward proximity",
      "content": "Dopamine release in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) both invigorates actions and encodes reward-related information, yet how these functions are integrated remains under active debate. To investigate this further, we designed four different versions of a rat Go/No-go task, where we systematically manipulated response requirements, temporal task demands, and controllability of reward pursuit. Dopamine release increased reliably during action initiation (Go) but was delayed during action suppression (No-go), and was insensitive to augmented response demands or controllability. Following response completion, dopamine rose gradually until animals arrived at the reward location, irrespective of reward-delivery timing, prior action demands, or controllability. This proximity dopamine-signal was exaggerated after animals exhibited Pavlovian consummatory behavior during No-go trials, revealing a motivational signal component. Together, these findings indicate that in reward contexts, VMS-dopamine signals successively integrate the invigoration of action initiation with the continuous estimation of spatial - but not temporal - proximity to rewards.",

      "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

It can be used in prod but for now it's under development.</p> <p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/adelra/anyid\">https://github.com/adelra/anyid</a></p> <p>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/anyid/\">https://pypi.org/project/anyid/</a></p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>It can generate a wide of IDs, like cuid2, snowflake, ulid etc.</p> <p><strong>How to install it:</strong></p> <pre><code>uv pip install anyid </code></pre> <p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p> <pre><code>from anyid import cuid, cuid2, ulid, snowflake, setup_snowflake_id_generator # Generate a CUID my_cuid = cuid() print(f&quot;CUID: {my_cuid}&quot;) # Generate a CUID2 my_cuid2 = cuid2() print(f&quot;CUID2: {my_cuid2}&quot;) # Generate a ULID my_ulid = ulid() print(f&quot;ULID: {my_ulid}&quot;) # For Snowflake, you need to set up the generator first setup_snowflake_id_generator(worker_id=1, datacenter_id=1) my_snowflake = snowflake() print(f&quot;Snowflake ID: {my_snowflake}&quot;) </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)</p> <p>Anyone who wants to generate IDs for their application. Anyone who deosn't want to write the ID algorithms from scratch.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)</p> <p>Didn't really see any alternatives, or maybe I missed it. But in general, there are individual Github Gists and libraries that do the same.</p> <p>Welcome any PRs, feedback, issues etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adelrahimi\"> /u/adelrahimi </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdtpyx/anyid_a_tiny_library_to_generate_any_id_you_might/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdtpyx/anyid_a_tiny_library_to_generate_any_id_you_might/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "NVUAtlas: A Comprehensive Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Resource for the Human Neurovascular Unit in Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Background: Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction is being recognized as one of the earliest contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, systematic investigation of NVU dysfunction is currently limited by lack of access to molecular level information due to underrepresentation of vascular and mural cells in standard single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets. Consequently, existing transcriptomic atlases lack the resolution necessary to capture the coordinated intercellular signaling and dysfunction across vascular components of NVU, including endothelial cells and pericytes. Methods: We constructed the Human NVU Atlas by integrating 11 publicly available snRNA-seq datasets, including vascular-enriched samples, from the human prefrontal cortex. This comprehensive dataset aggregates over 4.2 million nuclei from 748 donors, including AD patients and age-matched controls. We utilized a unified probabilistic pipeline based on deep generative models (SCVI) to perform batch-aware integration and employed an ensemble of supervised and deep-learning classifiers to rigorously re-annotate cell types. Differential expression and ligand-receptor interaction analyses were subsequently performed to identify cell-type-specific disruptions in males versus females. Results: The atlas successfully curated vascular populations from 11 studies to assemble the largest publicly available NVU cohort of endothelial cells (2.8%) and pericytes (1.9%) alongside astrocytes and neurons. Differential expression analysis revealed that while neurons predominantly exhibited gene downregulation in AD, vascular cells displayed a pattern of transcriptional hyperactivity with significant gene upregulation. We also identified pronounced sex-specific vulnerabilities; females exhibited distinct inflammatory signatures and downregulation of basement membrane collagen genes (e.g., COL4A1, COL4A2) in pericytes, whereas these changes were not observed in males. Moreover, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed a widespread loss of collagen-integrin signaling between pericytes and neurons, suggesting the involvement of extracellular matrix disruptions in NVU dysfunction observed in AD. Conclusion: The Human NVU Atlas provides a high-resolution, integrated transcriptomic framework for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit. By uncovering sex-specific vascular mechanisms and disrupted intercellular communication, this resource highlights the critical role of vascular cells in AD progression and serves as a foundational reference for investigating cerebrovascular contribution to AD.",
