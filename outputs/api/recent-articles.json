      "title": "In vitro reconstitution of hippocampal cell assemblies",
      "content": "Three-dimensional neuronal cultures, such as brain organoids, have proven effective for in vitro modeling of brain development and disease. However, it remains unclear whether these systems can intrinsically generate the spatiotemporal network motifs that support cognitive function, particularly given their lack of sensory input. To address this, we developed a 3D long-range modular neuronal network approach to test whether dissociated embryonic hippocampal cells can self-organize into neuronal manifolds capable of generating network dynamics analogous to the in vivo hippocampal cell assemblies implicated in cognitive function. Using all-optical interrogation, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of cell assemblies and their hallmark features, including recurring sequential activation, hierarchical chaining, multi-day stability, resilience to perturbation, and attractor-like pattern completion. We further investigated the effects of acute ketamine exposure on these assemblies, revealing network-wide reconfiguration reminiscent of in vivo responses. Finally, we show that human iPSC-derived neurons can similarly self-organize into modular network architectures. Together, these findings are consistent with an intrinsically inside-out view of the brain, rather than a tabula rasa model in which sensory input is required for the emergence of cognitive network motifs, and open new avenues for in vitro modeling of network-level mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Myelin maintenance and addition regulate synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse cortex",
      "content": "Myelination of the developing central nervous system (CNS) increases action potential conduction velocity but can also act as a plasticity brake, limiting neurite reorganisation and synaptic plasticity. As myelination is a life-long process, the myelin laid down in development or adulthood could also affect synapse number or plasticity across the lifespan. We report that conditionally deleting the transcription factor, myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), to disrupt the myelin maintenance program in oligodendrocytes (OLs) from P57 (Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice), led to significant myelin loss and impaired action potential conduction and gross motor performance. By sparsely labelling layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, we could visualise the apical and basal dendrites and their excitatory post-synaptic dendritic spines and determined that spine density was normal in P57+60 Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice. However, a higher proportion of the dendritic spines were large, stable mushroom spines and generated larger amplitude miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents. These data indicate that the myelin maintenance program is critical for preserving neuron adaptability, homeostasis and glutamate sensitivity. When we instead prevented the addition of new OLs and myelin from P57, action potential conduction velocity and gross motor performance appeared normal. Spine density was also normal in Pdgfr-CreERTM :: Myrf fl/fl mice, however, spine morphology was changed along the basal dendrites of layer V M1 pyramidal neurons. At P117, the basal dendrites were frozen in a state that resembled P57 dendrites, as they retained a higher proportion of thin, plastic spines. These data suggest that adult myelination supports the life-long accumulation of stable spines within the basal but not apical dendritic compartment and have important implications for understanding dendritic plasticity rules in the motor circuit.",

      "content": "The ability to compose complex mental representations by recombining simpler primitives is a characteristic of the human brain that manifests itself in a variety of domains such as spoken or written language, mathematics, or social reasoning. While it is known that these domains rest on partially distinct brain networks, they are rarely investigated together in the same paradigm. Here, we present a systematic functional MRI study of written and spoken word and sentence processing in each of these domains. In a true-false judgment task, adult participants were presented with a hierarchy of meaningless and meaningful stimuli bearing on various domains of general semantic knowledge and mathematics. The results show that distinct brain regions are activated by (1) syntax and semantics; (2) math versus non-math knowledge; (3) different domains of mathematics, such as geometry versus arithmetic; (4) social knowledge versus other knowledge. All of these regions are activated essentially identically in the written and spoken modalities. The results were replicated in a group of adolescents. Our experiments show that the human brain comprises distinct amodal networks for various domains of linguistic and semantic knowledge, and provide a simple paradigm to dissect them within a short fMRI session.",

      "title": "Salient auditory stimuli evoke spatially segregated phasic and sustained neural responses in the human brain",
      "content": "Salient sensory stimuli are known to evoke neural activations across distributed brain regions. However, the temporal dynamics of these responses over sub-second timescales remain poorly understood, in part due to limitations in the temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging methods. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activations evoked by salient sensory stimuli (rare sounds) using 1,194 widely distributed intracranial electrodes in 5 neurosurgical patients. Salient stimuli preferentially activated 263 of 1,194 electrodes (22%), with responses segregating into two largely distinct spatiotemporal patterns: (1) phasic activation in sensorimotor regions, and (2) sustained activation within the salience network. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that phasic sensorimotor activation preceded sustained salience network activation on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings support an updated view of salience processing in the human brain, revealing that salient stimuli evoke two sequential stages of neural activation - phasic sensorimotor responses followed by sustained salience network activity - rather than simultaneous widespread activation.",

      "title": "BRD1 haploinsufficiency alters early neuronal programming and disrupts maturation in human induced glutamatergic neurons",
      "content": "BRD1 is an epigenetic regulator implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, yet its role in human neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts early neuronal programming, resulting in accelerated maturation and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in human induced glutamatergic neurons. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early shift toward neuronal identity, characterized by downregulation of pluripotency markers and persistent upregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly and organization, including GRIA3. Despite this, BRD1+/- neurons form significantly smaller synapses and display increased neuronal activity. Our findings highlight BRD1 as a key regulator of neurodevelopmental timing and synaptic maturation, and network activity reinforcing growing evidence that disruptions in chromatin-mediated control of differentiation and synaptic organization contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Sex differences in the neural circuitry of aggression",
      "content": "The social behavior neural network (SBNN) is a circuit composed of reciprocally connected limbic structures that regulate a range of social behaviors, including aggression. Although both males and females of many species display aggressive behavior, studies of the neural circuitry underlying aggression have focused almost exclusively on males. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in neuronal activation of the neural circuitry controlling aggression in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We employed c-Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify neuronal activation following aggressive encounters between same-sex male and female dyads. Animals were tested in their home cage either alone (n=7 per sex) or with a same-sex, non-aggressive intruder (n=7 per sex) for 10 minutes. Our data revealed substantial sex differences in the neuronal activation of the SBNN following aggression. In some regions, neuronal activity changed in opposite directions in males and females compared to controls (e.g., posterior lateral septum), while in others, there was a change in neuronal activation in only one sex (e.g., medial amygdala). These findings support the hypothesis that the neural circuitry regulating aggression exhibits marked sexual differentiation.",
