      "title": "A Dual-Pathway Prediction Error Model of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders:Bridging NMDA Hypofunction and Dopaminergic Hyperfunction",
      "content": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) present a profound clinical enigma, manifesting as a heterogeneous continuum ranging from the chaotic volatility of acute psychosis to the impenetrable rigidity of systematized delusions. While neurobiological research has independently implicated NMDA receptor hypofunction or dopaminergic hyperfunction as cardinal pathophysiological distinct mechanisms, a computational framework capable of bridging these distinct cellular deficits to the spectrum's vast phenomenological diversity remains elusive. Here, we propose a biologically plausible neural model using a dynamic Bayesian inference with separable positive and negative prediction-error pathways. We demonstrate that NMDA hypofunction selectively blunts negative prediction errors, fostering rigid, bias-dominated beliefs, while dopaminergic hyperfunction uniformly amplifies error signals, driving volatile, observation-dominated states. Their interaction reconstructs SSDs as a continuous bias-volatility spectrum, accounting for key neurophysiological markers and offering a theoretical foundation for mechanism-based patient stratification.",

      "title": "Reward-driven emergence of auditory pattern encoding in the primate motor system",
      "content": "The ability to anticipate rhythmic patterns is fundamental to human experience, enabling music appreciation, speech comprehension, and dancing in sync to music. How the brain learns to use acoustic information to guide motor behavior remains a key question whose neural underpinnings and evolutionary origins are debated, especially in non-human primates. To understand how brain areas involved in motor control naively respond to predictable tone patterns, we recorded large single neuron populations across primary somatosensory (S1), primary motor (M1), dorsal premotor (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), pre-supplementary motor (preSMA) cortices, globus pallidus interna (GPi), and medial geniculate body (MGB) of a rhesus monkey. During passive listening (Experiment 1) with a reward only at the end of each trial, primarily the MGB, not motor areas, responded to the auditory tone patterns, ruling out the spontaneous entrainment of motor activity to auditory patterns. Almost all areas robustly represented the elapsed time within the trial, suggesting a general tracking of trial progression and reward structure. Next, we tested if motor areas learn to respond to auditory patterns if associated with rewards. When each tone was simultaneously accompanied by a liquid reward (Experiment 2), all areas except S1 showed clear responses to the tone patterns. To test if the tone responses persisted, the reward contingency was subsequently removed (Experiment 3). Strikingly, although the reward was delivered only at the trial's end as in Experiment 1, GPi neurons continued to track the occurrence of the tones. These findings suggest that while basic sensory processing of tone patterns occurs in the MGB, higher-order processing in motor areas is profoundly shaped by reward association. This reorganisation of neural responsiveness shows that the capacity for auditory association can be elicited in the motor system through appropriate motivational contexts.",

      "title": "A functional influence based circuit motif that constrains the set of plausible algorithms of cortical function",
      "content": "There are several plausible algorithms for cortical function that are specific enough to make testable predictions of the interactions between functionally identified cell types. Many of these algorithms are based on some variant of predictive processing. Here we set out to experimentally distinguish between two such predictive processing variants. A central point of variability between them lies in the proposed vertical communication between layer 2/3 and layer 5, which stems from the diverging assumptions about the computational role of layer 5. One assumes a hierarchically organized architecture and proposes that, within a given node of the network, layer 5 conveys unexplained bottom-up input to prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. The other proposes a non-hierarchical architecture in which internal representation neurons of layer 5 provide predictions for the local prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. We show that the functional influence of layer 2/3 cell types on layer 5 is incompatible with the hierarchical variant, while the functional influence of layer 5 cell types on prediction error neurons of layer 2/3 is incompatible with the non-hierarchical variant. Given these data, we can constrain the space of plausible algorithms of cortical function. We propose a model for cortical function based on a combination of a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and predictive processing that makes experimentally testable predictions.",

      "title": "A Detailed Model for Understanding the Human Neocortex",
      "content": "The neocortex underlies cognitive abilities that set humans apart from other species. Although Ramon y Cajal initiated its study in the 19th century, much about its fundamental properties remain poorly understood. Biologically detail modeling, has been shown to serve as a tool to understand the modeled system better. By comparing computational models for different species we can highlight functional differences between them, find their anatomical or physiological basis and thus improve our understanding of cortical function. In this study we built a detailed model of a human cortical microcircuit following an established workflow. We compared the human data and results against a previously published reconstruction of rat cortical circuitry. To parametrize the human model, we gathered new original data on human morphological reconstructions, axonal bouton densities, single cell and synaptic recordings. We combined them with data available in the literature and open-sourced databases. We also developed various strategies to overcome the missing data, such as generalizing or adapt- ing data from rodents. The resulting model consists of seven columnar units with similar characteristics. Each column has a radius of 476 um, a height of 2622 um, a volume of 1.86 mm3, a total cell density of 24,186 cells/mm3, on the order of 35,000 cells, around 12 million connections and approximately 47 million synapses. Comparing the rat and the human model showed that the human cortex is less dense in terms of cell bodies than the rodent cortex. Human cells have more complex branching, but lower bouton densities than rodent cells. However, the number of connections between cell types is similar.",

      "title": "Push-and-pull protein dynamics leads to log-normal synaptic sizes and probabilistic multi-spine plasticity",
      "content": "A typical neuron receives thousands of inputs and is able to adapt the strength of its synapses to store new information and meet ongoing computational demands. The synaptic response to plasticity induction is stochastic and spatially structured but is traditionally described by deterministic models representing the enquote{average} dynamics. Growing experimental evidence indicates that not only the stimulation protocol determines the plasticity outcome but that the initial synaptic sizes, their fluctuations, and the spatial competition for the plasticity-relevant proteins play a decisive role. This probabilistic perspective makes it hard to predict the fate of a given synapse and requires a conceptual shift from a single synapse view to a probabilistic multi-spine competitive process where the plasticity needs and the available resources are considered together. Here, we propose a data-driven modeling framework able to predict collective plasticity outcomes along a dendrite based on the initial size, the number, and the spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated synapses. Our data analysis reveals a log-normal distribution of protein numbers for many plasticity-mediating proteins and shows that this log-normal protein allocation constrains and controls the collective plasticity outcome across multiple stimulated and non-stimulated synapses while preserving a global size distribution. Our findings highlight how local stochastic processes and global protein allocation rules give rise to synaptic plasticity outcomes, offering a new framework to understand and predict dendritic computation.",

      "title": "Network analysis of optimal deep or machine learning strategies for classification and detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on MRI scanning",
      "content": "BackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) presents a significant global health challenge, with its prevalence projected to increase substantially by 2050. Despite its widespread impact, the underlying causes and mechanisms remain incompletely understood, complicating efforts toward effective diagnosis and treatment. Pathologically, AD is marked by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but the relationship between these factors and disease progression is complex and heterogeneous.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to compare the efficacy of different deep/machine learning models based on MRI scanning.MethodsThe study follows rigorous systematic review protocols, adhering to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Interventions and the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Medline, and EMBASE. Advanced statistical methods were used for data synthesis and analysis, incorporating network meta-analysis and machine learning techniques to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of different diagnostic models.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 11 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria. The studies employed various machine learning algorithms, including CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet, to classify AD and distinguish it from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. The results indicate that CNN and ResNet consistently outperform other models in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology and AI-driven diagnostics demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the diagnostic process.ConclusionDespite challenges such as data heterogeneity and the interpretability of AI-driven models, the study highlights the transformative potential of computational techniques and advanced imaging technologies in AD diagnosis and management. The integration of network-based analyses and machine learning approaches offers promising avenues for future research, aiming to revolutionize the understanding and approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

      "title": "Decoding the mechanisms of acupuncture by neuroimaging: an integrated review from networks to molecules",
      "content": "Acupuncture, a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is widely used for conditions like chronic pain and functional disorders, yet its neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. This review synthesizes findings from multimodal neuroimaging\u2013including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET)\u2013to examine the central nervous system and neurochemical correlates of acupuncture. We summarize reports of its modulatory effects on large-scale brain networks (e.g., Default Mode Network, Salience Network) and neural oscillations, alongside evidence of neurochemical changes. Importantly, we also address the methodological limitations, inconsistent results, and significant role of non-specific (e.g., placebo) effects prevalent in this literature (Chen B. et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024). Building on this evidence, we propose a multi-level integrative framework that outlines a potential pathway from peripheral stimulation to clinical outcomes via neurochemical and network-level interactions, while carefully distinguishing observed correlations from established causation. We conclude by discussing future research priorities, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols, rigorous causal inference, and a measured approach to translating emerging technologies. This review aims to bridge traditional practice with modern neuroscience by offering a balanced perspective that highlights both progress and persistent challenges in the field.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomically informed psychotherapy after mild brain injury: a single-case report of clinical improvement",
      "content": "Psychotherapeutic interventions following acquired brain injury often underestimate the influence of neural connectivity on emotional and cognitive recovery, contributing to treatment response variability. We present a single-case report of an adult with mild acquired brain injury, in whom diffusion tensor imaging (tractography) and neuropsychological assessment were integrated to guide individualized clinical planning. Baseline tractography revealed globally preserved white-matter organization with rightward asymmetries in the uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculi\u2013pathways involved in cognitive\u2013emotional integration. This specific neuroanatomical profile informed a psychotherapeutic plan that prioritized attentional and experiential strategies, being functionally compatible with the preserved networks, over those requiring complex verbal-analytic processing. After 1 year of intervention (approximately 40 sessions), reassessment documented significant functional improvements, quantified by a reduction in anxiety to a non-clinical range (HADS-A: 11 \u2192 6) and a normalization in cognitive flexibility (TMT-B: 190 \u2192 128 s), without observable structural change. These findings validate the hypothesis that therapeutic change may arise from functional optimization within preserved networks rather than anatomical reorganization. This report proposes the functional compatibility framework as a transferable and theoretically grounded model for precision psychotherapy, bridging the gap between neuroscience and clinical practice.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Evaluating haptic experience using EEG and deep learning across multiple modalities: linking stimulus and self-reports",
      "content": "Conventionally, evaluations of haptic interfaces have relied on self-reported assessments, which offer limited objectivity and can disrupt the user experience, making it challenging to design interfaces that dynamically adapt to users' cognitive state in real time. To overcome these limitations, cognitive haptic interfaces leverage neurophysiological measures such as EEG and deep learning to directly capture the brain's responses to haptic stimulation. A key challenge is how to label these neural responses: do we ground models in objectively controlled Physical Stimulation (PS) parameters, or in participants' Self-Reported (SR) perceptions? The goal of this work is not to demonstrate that EEG can reproduce subjective reports, but rather to systematically examine how neural responses relate to these two aspects of haptic experience by training deep learning models under both PS and SR labeling schemes. Here, we investigate how PS- versus SR-based labeling impacts model performance across four modalities: (i) delayed force-feedback (DFF), (ii) fingertip vibration feedback (FVF), (iii) upper-body vibration feedback (UVF), and (iv) fingertip thermal feedback (FTF). We evaluate three deep learning benchmarked architectures: ATCNet, EEG Inception, and EEG Conformer on EEG data labeled according to both approaches. Across all modalities, PS-labeled models yield more stable and higher performance than SR-labeled models in a group-level leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting, with the largest gains at near-perceptual-threshold levels (e.g., mild thermal changes, moderate vibration intensities, borderline delay settings) where SR labels are most variable across individuals. Rather than aiming to replace self-reports, these results reveal when EEG-based models align more closely with the physical stimulation than with participants' reports and support using PS-trained decoders as a structured first-stage representation that can later be adapted with user-specific SR information.",
