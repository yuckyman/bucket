      "title": "Functionally Relevant and Reliable Brain Stimulation Targets for Enhancement of Novel Word-Learning",
      "content": "Linking word forms and their meanings is central to language learning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has shown potential to enhance this process, but with variable effects. This study aimed to (1) identify reliable and functionally relevant tDCS target brain regions to enhance novel-word learning, using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compatible associative picture-pseudoword learning task, and (2) assess test retest reliability (TRR) of behavioral and imaging outcomes. Twenty healthy individuals completed two fMRI sessions using parallel task versions. Participants learned picture pseudoword associations across four learning blocks. A lexical decision task served as control condition. Behavioral learning was analyzed using linear mixed models. Whole brain and region of interest analyses examined learning related activity changes and their behavioral relevance. TRR was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Participants successfully acquired the novel-word forms, indexed by increased accuracy and faster latency across stages. Behavioral outcomes showed good to excellent TRR. The task elicited robust language learning related activity and activity changes across stages were correlated with learning success. The control task showed no consistent activity changes. Task-related brain activity showed substantial variability, but a subset of voxels (~30%) within significant clusters showed good consistency. In sum, we identified accessible, reliable and functionally relevant cortical targets for enhancing novel word learning by tDCS. TRR results support the usefulness of APPL task for future concurrent tDCS fMRI research. Our study also outlines a general path towards optimization of brain stimulation studies by implementing an empirically informed approach for selecting reliable and relevant target regions and implementation of reliable experimental and imaging paradigms.",

      "title": "Human-specific fast synaptic kinetics enable rapid detection of predictive features",
      "content": "Humans can discern the underlying principles in complex environments, but the cellular basis of this ability is unclear. By comparing layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in five mammals (mouse, rat, marmoset, macaque and human), we found that human neurons exhibited distinctively faster kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmissions. In a computational model, neurons with human-type synapses detected hidden patterns more quickly in noise, and this superiority was only evident in unsupervised learning. Tracking synaptic weights revealed that human synapses were potentiated sharply and persistently by the patterns, while macaque-type synapses were broadly potentiated, which were easily eroded. These data suggest that the human-specific acceleration of synaptic kinetics enables the rapid extraction of latent structures in complex environments, providing a cellular basis for our efficient cognitive abilities.",

      "title": "Fully Automated EEG Source Imaging Using Structured Sparsity for Single and Multiple Synchronous Epileptic Activities",
      "content": "Accurate localization of epileptic zones from High-Resolution ElectroEncephaloGraphy (HR-EEG) data can be challenging, especially when multiple synchronous zones are involved, and is highly dependent on the chosen EEG Source Imaging (ESI) method. Since a given scalp-level electrical pattern can result from multiple source configurations, ESI methods address this ill-posed inverse problem by imposing constraints on the structure of underlying sources. Here, we present an efficient approach that imposes sparsity on both the source-level activity and its spatial gradient. Unlike other methods that generally require a heuristic choice of a regularization parameter that balances between data fidelity and constraints, our method iteratively adjusts the parameter value based on the noise level in a fully automated way. The performance of the new method is evaluated across different scenarios of realistic synthetic HR-EEG data, including unifocal and synchronous multifocal cortical epileptic activity. Based on multiple performance indices, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in accurately reconstructing epileptic sources. We also show that the method reduces polarity artifacts responsible for ghost sources and spatial discontinuities. Its ability to recover homogeneous, well-delineated regions of activity is further confirmed using real EEG data capturing a typical absence seizure.",

      "title": "Choosing the best or avoiding the worst: complementary and opponent value signals in the human brain",
      "content": "Whether the brain encodes the subjective value of pleasant and unpleasant situations via a single integrated circuit or through distinct pathways remains unresolved. It is also unclear how neural value signals guide choices when the context involves choosing the most favorable option or avoiding the most unfavorable one. To address these questions, we recorded intracerebral activity from 27 participants as they first rated pleasant and unpleasant scenarios and then made binary choices across all combinations of item domain (pleasant/unpleasant) and choice frame (choose best/worst). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) broadband gamma activity (BGA, 50 to150 Hz) tracked the value of pleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating positively with the most pleasant item irrespective of choice frame. Similarly, anterior insula (aIns) BGA tracked the value of unpleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating negatively with the most unpleasant item irrespective of choice frame. The difference in relative value correlations between the vmPFC and aIns was larger for choices involving a conflict between item domain and choice frame, consistent with slower response times and choices less aligned with value differences in these trials. These findings reveal dissociable yet complementary neural systems for pleasant and unpleasant valuation and highlight how such signals may guide flexible decision making across contexts.",

      "title": "Structural and functional brain asymmetry in relation to heterogeneous causes of situs inversus totalis",
      "content": "Various aspects of brain organization differ between the left and right hemispheres. Clues to the developmental origins of these asymmetries may be gained through associations with situs inversus totalis (SIT), a rare condition in which visceral organs are reversed on the left-right axis. In the largest previous brain imaging analyses of SIT (38 cases, 38 controls from Belgium), typical functional asymmetries such as left-hemisphere language dominance were mostly unaltered, but various aspects of asymmetrical cerebral structure - petalia, bending, and posterior venous anatomy - were often reversed in this condition. SIT can be a monogenic trait that arises from rare genetic variants, usually affecting motile cilia which help to create the embryonic left-right body axis. However, most SIT cases do not have obvious genetic causes and may arise from environmental or random effects during embryogenesis. We sequenced the genomes of 23 SIT cases and 23 controls from the Belgian brain imaging dataset and pooled with prior data from 15 cases and 15 controls. We aimed to discover whether there are altered brain asymmetries in SIT cases with disruptive DNA variants in ciliary genes, or in other types of genes, as compared to genetically unsolved cases. In total, 19 cases had likely causal variants affecting ciliary function, while 19 cases remained genetically unsolved. Functional and structural brain asymmetries were not significantly different in genetically solved versus unsolved SIT cases. Therefore, functional brain asymmetries seem largely independent of known mechanisms of visceral situs formation, while structural brain torque is altered in SIT regardless of the presence or absence of overt genetic causes.",

      "title": "A Caveat Regarding the Unfolding Argument: Implications of Plasticity for Computational Theories of Consciousness",
      "content": "The unfolding argument in the neuroscience of consciousness posits that causal structure cannot account for consciousness because any recurrent neural network (RNN) can be \"unfolded\" into a functionally equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN) with identical input-output behavior. Subsequent debate has focused on dynamical properties and philosophy of science critiques. We examine a novel caveat to the unfolding argument for RNN systems with plasticity in the connection weights. We demonstrate through rigorous mathematical proofs that plasticity negates the functional equivalence between RNN and FNN. Our proofs address history-dependent plasticity, dynamical systems analysis, information-theoretic considerations, perturbational stability, complexity growth, and resource limitations. We demonstrate that neuronal systems that possess properties such as plasticity, history-dependence, and complex temporal information encoding have features that cannot be captured by a static FNN. Our findings delineate limitations of the unfolding argument that apply if consciousness arises from temporally extended dynamic neural processes rather than static input-output mappings. This work has implications for various theories of consciousness, and for the fields of computational neuroscience and philosophy of mind more generally, providing new constraints for theories of consciousness.",
