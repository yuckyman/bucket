      "title": "Intrinsic excitability controls structural plasticity of cerebellar climbing fibers",
      "content": "In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) convey a teaching signal to Purkinje cells (PCs) that is crucial for cerebellar learning. They undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity during development and learning, and their transverse branches have an activity-dependent control of mobility. The maintenance of their structure was shown to rely on the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is highly expressed in these fibers under basal conditions in adults and which is controlled by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation. Although activity-dependent structural plasticity occurs in several axonal fibers throughout the brain, it remains unclear whether this is also the case for the main branches of CFs. Here, we investigate this issue using in vivo knock-down of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) in the CF-generating neurons of the inferior olive, and analyzing CF three-dimensional morphology, density and function of synaptic contacts with PCs. We show that the decrease in intrinsic excitability causes a reduction in the number and length of CF branches and that similar effects are caused by the knockdown of GAP-43, suggesting that GAP-43 may mediate this response. We also show that the retraction of CF fibers is associated with a seemingly compensatory increase in the density of CF synaptic terminals and PC dendritic spines, specifically in the area where PCs receive CF inputs. These plastic modifications are associated with a decrease in paired-pulse ratio and an increase in the kinetics and transferred charge of synaptic currents. Our data show that CFs can undergo activity-dependent structural plasticity changes affecting synaptic transmission and suggest the possibility that they contribute to encoding memories in the cerebellum and, if disrupted, to the pathophysiology of cerebellar diseases.",

      "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity of Thalamoprefrontal Circuitry Characterizes Learning Across Species",
      "content": "Learning is an adaptive process which is thought to require precise coordination among multiple brain regions over time. Thalamoprefrontal circuitry is central to multiple domains of cognitive control and executive function, yet its evolution during learning is not characterized. In this study, we explored thalamoprefrontal circuit signaling in mice and connectivity dynamics in humans over the course of learning a homologous psychomotor task. In mice, we targeted a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to the mediodorsal-prefrontal (MdT-dmPFC) projection and used fiber photometry to record synaptic dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity. As learning sessions progressed, all mice demonstrated a decrease in reaction time (RT) performance on successful trials (p<0.001). In concomitant synaptic MdT-dmPFC circuit activity across sessions, we observed a significant increase in activity during the anticipatory (p<0.01) and reward retrieval (p<0.01) periods, and a non-significant trend towards an increase in preparatory activity (p<0.15). However, following the learning period, during task re-exposure, we observed a significant shift in circuit activity, away from anticipatory (p<0.001) and towards the preparatory period (p<0.001) over the course of re-exposure sessions. Furthermore, we observed an emergence of a learner (decrease in RT) and a non-learner group (increase in RT) during the task re-exposure period. Over the course of a single analogous task session in humans, we also observed a learner and a non-learner group. When analyzing the thalamoprefrontal regional connectivity dynamics of early and late trials for learners, we observed a significant increase in low frequency and decrease in high frequency synchrony (connectivity tilt) in thalamoprefrontal pathways during preparatory and anticipatory periods. Interestingly, pairwise interactions specifically between the anterior corona radiata (ACR) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the human homolog to the genetically targeted MdT-dmPFC circuitry in mice, in fact demonstrated a robustly opposite connectivity tilt effect distinguishing learners from non-learners (Cohens d > 2). Overall, these findings may provide cross-species evidence of novel, conserved thalamoprefrontal circuit mechanisms of adaptive learning.",

      "title": "Social Processing in the Amygdala: Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing Reveals Distinct Neuronal Responses to Dominant and Subordinate Cues",
      "content": "The amygdala serves as a critical neural hub for interpreting social cues, with its distinct subregions and diverse neuronal populations playing specialized roles in processing these signals. This study employs single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the amygdala's neuronal responses to olfactory cues associated with social dominance, uncovering distinct activation patterns within glutamatergic and GABAergic populations. We find that a glutamatergic cluster, characterized by expression patterns closely aligned with glutamatergic Slc17a7 (VGLUT1) medial amygdala (MeA) neurons, preferentially responds to dominant cues. In contrast, a larger glutamatergic Slc17a6 (VGLUT2) cluster associated with neurons of the MeA, as well as cortical and basomedial amygdala, exhibits a heightened response to subordinate cues, underscoring the MeA region's role in processing social olfactory information. Additionally, a glutamatergic cluster resembling dorsal endopririform (EPd) neurons responded more to dominant stimuli, supporting the EPd's role in olfactory perception. We also identified a GABAergic cluster with elevated dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) expression that predominantly responds to dominant cues, consistent with this receptor's known role in mediating threat responses. Through gene co-expression network analysis, we linked gene expression within neuronal clusters to specific biological processes. These findings reveal distinct neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying social processing, particularly in response to dominant and subordinate olfactory signals, thus enhancing our understanding of the neural substrates of social behavior.",

      "title": "Role of Bassoon-mediated active zone integrity at different types of brain synapses for brain activity and cortex-dependent memory formation",
      "content": "Background: The properly controlled release of neurotransmitter at presynaptic active zones is crucial for brain function and performance. Bassoon is a major scaffolding protein involved in the organization of neurotransmitter release sites at excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory brain synapses. Global deficiency of functional Bassoon causes severe neurological conditions including disturbed patterns of brain activity and early-onset epilepsy. To distinguish the contribution of different types of synapses to this phenotype we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking the Bsn gene in (i) GABAergic interneurons expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Dlx5/6 regulatory elements (BsnDlx5/6 cKO), (ii) glutamatergic forebrain neurons expressing Cre under the Emx1 promoter (BsnEmx1 cKO), and (iii) dopaminergic neurons expressing DAT-driven Cre (BsnDAT). Methods: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was employed to assess in vivo brain-wide activation patterns in the cKO mice and corresponding control animals with wildtype Bsn genes. A cortex-dependent learning task to discriminate frequency-modulated tones was then used to evaluate the cognitive abilities of the different cKO lines. Results: Marked reduction of brain activity was found in various cortical areas and the basolateral amygdala of BsnDlx5/6 cKO mice, while patches of increased activity were detected in the dorsal striatum. BsnEmx1 cKO mice, in contrast, display increased brain activity in many cortical areas. Only minor changes in CBF were detected in BsnDAT cKO mice. Concerning auditory discrimination learning BsnDlx5/6cKO mice were severely impaired, although they responded to stimuli normally. On the other hand, BsnEmx1 cKO mice acquired the task more efficiently reaching maximum performance levels faster than control animals. Surprisingly, BsnDATcKO mice did not differ in their behavior from the control group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that absence of Bassoon from presynapses of GABAergic interneurons expressing Dlx5/6 gene during development results in severe neurological symptoms and associated dysfunctions. Instead, network changes associated with Bassoon deficiency at glutamate release sites of excitatory forebrain neurons, even seem to have an enhancing effect on learning.",

      "title": "The brain architecture of punishment learning",
      "content": "Learning which actions cause harm is essential for survival, yet how the brain transforms this knowledge into adaptive control of behavior remains unclear. We combined whole-brain analysis, multisite chemogenetic silencing, spatial transcriptomics, and longitudinal calcium imaging to map how punishment learning reorganizes brain networks across scales. Learning reshaped mesoscale community organization into a network anchored by the amygdala, subthalamic hypothalamic zone, and ventral midbrain tegmentum. These regions contributed distinct components of adaptive avoidance and engaged diverse transcriptional programs across multiple neuronal subclasses. Within this network, the amygdala acted as a hub, partitioning action and outcome information and remapping neural geometry to segregate punished from safe actions. Together, these results identify a multiscale neural architecture through which aversive experience can be transformed into flexible behavioral control.",

      "title": "Distinct Roles of Deep and Superficial Cortical Layers in Tone Prediction, Comparison, and Adaptation in Human Auditory Cortex",
      "content": "Auditory perception relies on prior sensations both to form expectations about upcoming sounds and to adapt to repeated inputs. Yet, how these processes interact with bottom-up frequency-specific stimulus drive, and how they are organised across cortical depth, remains unclear. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), participants listened to stochastic tone sequences whose repetition structure and predictability varied over time. For each voxel independently, we used computational modelling to estimate responses for stimulus drive, repetition suppression, and expectations. We then partitioned the unique and shared variance of these components to estimate their relative importance in modulating BOLD activity across cortical layers in auditory cortex. Expectation-related signals explained most unique variance in deep (infagranular) layers, in line with accounts that place internal model representations and belief updates in deeper cortical populations. Variance jointly explained by stimulus drive and expectation was instead strongest in superficial layers, consistent with these compartments expressing computations that combine bottom-up input with top-down predictions, such as prediction error signalling. Finally, repetition suppression accounted for variance uniformly across depth, suggesting an adaptation-like mechanism that modulates responsiveness without a clear laminar bias. Together, the data suggest that deep layers contain content-specific predictive models, superficial layers register prediction-input alignment, and repetition suppression provides a depth-invariant, local gain control that complements predictive processing.",

      "title": "Sex and experience dependent regulation of synaptic protein turnover",
      "content": "Synaptic transmission can be carefully tuned through plasticity mechanisms that regulate synaptic strength, structure, and number. In vivo measurements demonstrate remarkable spine dynamics, with subsets of synapses persisting for months. This correlates with the extreme longevity of certain memories, which can persist for an organisms lifetime. The molecular basis supporting the long-term stability of specific synapses and the long-term durability of memories remains unknown. At the protein level, most proteins persist for a relatively short amount of time before they are degraded and replaced with new molecules. However, recent work has identified a population of proteins, including those present at the synapse, that are exceptionally long-lived. It has been speculated that long-lived proteins (LLPs) could contribute to long-term synapse stability, function, and memory. Here, we used stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) to first identify LLPs in the post synaptic density (PSD) of the hippocampus and subsequently determine if protein turnover rates varied by sex or following learning. We identified novel synaptic LLPs and found that both sex and experience can regulate synaptic protein turnover rates. We identified sex-dependent changes in protein turnover rates in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, including increased stability of Gabrg2, a GABA-A receptor subunit, in male mice. Furthermore, we observed stabilization of a subset of PSD proteins, such as Shank3, following contextual fear conditioning. We propose that sex and experience dependent changes in protein turnover rates could help explain sex-differences in psychiatric risk and aid our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support learning and memory.",

      "title": "Exposure to Maternal Pre- and Postnatal Psychological Distress: Associations with Brain Structure in 5-year-old Children",
      "content": "Background: Maternal mental health is an important contributor to child neurodevelopment. While there are multiple studies on prenatal exposure, early postnatal exposure has received little attention in neuroimaging research. Methods: 5-year-old children (n = 173) were recruited from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study. Maternal distress was assessed using questionnaires on depressive and anxiety symptoms at 14, 24 and 34 gestational weeks and postnatally at 3, 6 and 24 months. T1-weighted structural images were processed using a voxel-based morphometry pipeline to map associations between maternal distress exposure and regional gray matter (GM) volumes, while accounting for potential confounders. Results: We found widespread associations between maternal distress symptoms and offspring brain morphology. Higher prenatal distress at 14 gestational weeks was positively associated with regional GM volume in the right superior parietal lobe and precuneus. In contrast, postnatal distress at 3 months was negative associated with GM volumes in multiple motor regions, the left anterior insula, right superior frontal areas and supramarginal gyrus. Postnatal distress at 6 months demonstrated a positive relationship with GM volumes in the right calcarine and lingual gyri, while distress at 24 months was negatively associated with GM volumes in the left supramarginal and right superior frontal gyri. Conclusions: This study provides support for hypotheses proposing that fetal and early life exposure to maternal distress can influence the structural development of the brain. Furthermore, it highlights the role of early postnatal period and calls for further research into this so far overlooked period and pathways that explain the associations.",

      "title": "Predictive Neural Signals during Natural Mandarin Speech Comprehension",
      "content": "Language comprehension requires transforming continuous speech into hierarchical linguistic representations, from phonemes to words to sentences. Prediction has been proposed as a key mechanism supporting this process across languages. Here, we extend this framework to Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language with a distinct phonological structure. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded neural responses from native speakers listening to an audiobook, and applied linear regression modeling to examine how linguistic features modulate brain activity. We found that listeners segmented continuous speech into multiple linguistic units, and that surprisal modulated neural responses at several representational levels, though not at the finest phonemic level. Tonal information was not independently predicted, but played a critical role when integrated with its segmental component. Finally, entropy reduction--an information-theoretic measure that quantifies how much a word reduces uncertainty about future words in a sentence--elicited a later and temporally distinct neural response from surprisal, indicating independent contributions of these two information-theoretic measures. Together, our findings suggest that predictive mechanisms in language comprehension are universal in their computational principles, but implemented in ways shaped by language-specific structural features, and that local surprisal resolution precedes the global updating of sentence interpretation.",

      "content": "BackgroundUpper limb motor impairment after stroke is a major cause of limitations in daily activities and reduced quality of life. Although traditional rehabilitation is effective, it is often insufficiently intensive and lacks focus on fine motor activation. Portable soft exoskeletons offer a promising approach to intensify recovery. This trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ReHand robotic system in subacute stroke rehabilitation.MethodsThis Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) included 120 patients in the subacute period of stroke. Participants were stratified by age and motor deficit severity and randomized into the intervention group (robotic therapy + standard therapy) or control group (standard therapy only). The intervention was delivered 5 times per week over 8\u202fweeks. The primary outcome was change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE); secondary outcomes included Barthel Index (BI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Wolf Motor Function Test (mWMFT), Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis was performed in Python (v3.11). Normality was assessed with the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test; the Mann\u2013Whitney test was used for intergroup comparisons; Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test with Yates\u2019 correction was used for categorical variables. Effect size was calculated using Cliff\u2019s delta; rank-ANCOVA was performed via the Quade method. Significance was set at p\u202f<\u202f0.05.ResultsThe intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in upper limb motor impairment compared to the control group, as reflected by larger gains in FMA-UE scores. Clinically meaningful improvements (\u22655.25 points) were observed in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group versus 43.3% in the control group. All secondary outcomes also showed significant improvements in the intervention group (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No adverse events were reported in either group.ConclusionWhen combined with standard therapy, the ReHand robotic system may enhance upper limb recovery after stroke and appears to be a safe and feasible adjunct to multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, identifier (NCT06937346).",
