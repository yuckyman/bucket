      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "title": "A correlation-based tool for quantifying membrane periodic skeleton associated periodicity",
      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",
