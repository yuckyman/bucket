      "title": "Rescuing Neurodevelopmental Deficits in AMPA Receptor Gain-of-Function Mutant",
      "content": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for neuronal development and brain function. We investigated the role of a recurrent variant in the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T) identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). To test causality and mechanism, we generated a Gria1-A636T knock-in mouse model. Mutant mice exhibited core ASD/ID-like behaviors and a selective hippocampal vulnerability characterized by progressive dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss. Despite reduced GluA1-containing complexes, AMPARs displayed synaptic hyperexcitability and failed to undergo the normal postnatal transition to calcium-impermeable AMPARs, resulting in persistent excitotoxicity. To explore therapeutic intervention, we designed an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide to specifically silence the mutant transcript. A single neonatal administration of the antisense oligonucleotide entirely prevented hippocampal pathology and ameliorated behavioral deficits. These findings establish GRIA1-A636T as a gain-of-function mutation that drives developmental excitotoxicity and highlight the potential of RNA-targeted precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Postmortem brain MRI reveals differential associations of subcortical and limbic volumes with cortical thinning and neuropathology patterns",
      "content": "The impact of different neuropathologies on deep brain structures remains to be understood. In this study, we investigate subcortical and limbic volumetry in neurodegenerative diseases involving concomitant co-pathologies (p-tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43). We acquired neuropathological measures and brain segmentations from ex vivo postmortem analysis of 132 donors with Alzheimer disease (AD; n=60), Lewy body disease (LBD; n=26), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP; n=21) and FTLD-Tau (n=25). Compared with AD and LBD, individuals with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau exhibited significantly reduced thalamic and striatal volumes. Disease-specific cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic associations were observed: AD showed widespread cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic morphometric associations, whereas LBD demonstrated more restricted parieto-occipital cortical-limbic associations. FTLD-TDP was characterized by predominant cortico-subcortical associations, while FTLD-Tau showed stronger cortico-limbic coupling. Pathology/structure analyses revealed that in AD and FTLD-Tau, hippocampal volume was associated with p-tau burden, neuronal loss, and gliosis. In LBD, thalamic alpha-synuclein severity was associated with both subcortical and limbic volumes, whereas no significant volumetric associations with TDP-43 burden were detected in FTLD-TDP. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct structure-structure and structure-pathology relationships across neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the value of ex vivo postmortem neuroimaging for disentangling disease-specific patterns of deep brain vulnerability.",

      "content": "Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests spatial memory impairment and tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, how EC neural activity contributes to memory deficits in tauopathy remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with virtual reality to examine medial EC (MEC) activity in PS19 tauopathy mice during 10 days of spatial learning. PS19 males exhibited pronounced learning deficits and their MEC neurons showed impaired speed modulation, unstable spatial encoding, and weakened representations in cue-poor relative to cue-rich regions, suggesting disrupted path integration. These deficits were most prominent in pyramidal cells, which accumulated higher levels of phosphorylated tau than stellate cells, particularly in males. Notably, MEC activity robustly predicted learning performance, especially via non-grid and pyramidal cells, and distinguished PS19 from wild-type mice. Together, these findings identify MEC dysfunction as a key neural correlate of spatial memory decline in AD-related tauopathy, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Expression of the human immunomodulatory protein, human B7-1 (CD80), accelerates neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, microvascular instability and lethality in a murine model of Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immune loci exhibit significant sequence diversity, with human proteins sharing only 45% to 70% identity with their murine orthologs. This divergence contributes to the inability of many established mouse models to accurately capture key neuroinflammatory mechanisms relevant to human AD. We recently identified that the human, but not murine, immunomodulatory protein B71 (CD80) activates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), a function arising from evolutionary divergence in human B71. This discovery provides an opportunity to directly interrogate the role of this interaction in disease progression using a well-characterized murine model of mutant A{beta} overexpression (CRND8). We generated a mouse line in which murine B71 was replaced with a chimeric human:murine B71 that retains normal interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28, while gaining the ability to bind p75, and evaluated its effects in CRND8 mice. Expression of human:murine B71 in vivo resulted in increased lethality, accelerated neuroinflammation of resident glia, more rapid synaptic and dendritic loss, and enhanced microvascular compromise in the subiculum compared to CRND8 mice expressing murine B71. Together, these findings identify the human B71:p75 interaction as a previously unrecognized contributor to AD pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target in a brain region critical for learning and memory that is affected in early stages of disease.",

      "title": "Memory schema reorganization induced by the deliberate processing in the executive network supported by widespread amplified activity",
      "content": "Schema accommodation is the reorganization of a preexisting memory schema to deeply accept new information incongruent with it. Although it is crucial for flexible intelligence, it occurs infrequently, making its neural basis difficult to study. To overcome this, we conducted an fMRI experiment using a newly developed experimental paradigm, the reversal description task. The results suggest that the schema changes that occurred during the task were global reorganizations rather than local adjustments. Moreover, the executive network responsible for deliberate processing played a central role, with the support of widespread amplified activity. Furthermore, reinforcement learning-based control implemented in these neural substrates, in cooperation with the caudate nucleus, emerged as a candidate mechanism for the deliberative schema update. These findings indicate that memory reorganization involves not only automatic but also deliberate processes, in which the desired global structure is explored through the control operation performed by these neural bases.",

      "title": "Discovery of Abundant Nano-scale Lymphatic-like Vessels in Brains",
      "content": "As one of the most metabolically active organs, the high metabolic demands of the brain require a highly efficient system for waste clearance. However, it remains unclear whether the brain possesses such an efficient system, and if so, what are the features of the system. Over a decade ago, a glymphatic system was proposed to describe neurofluid transport through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perivascular spaces (PVS), complemented by dural and meningeal lymphatic pathways. Nonetheless, it is still elusive whether transport within the CSF and PVS occurs as a structured form of flow. Moreover, unlike the abundance of blood capillaries in the brain, only a low density of lymphatic vessels has been observed. Such a low density of lymphatic vessels is unlikely to support the level of efficiency required for effective metabolic waste clearance in the brain. By combining expansion microscopic imaging with CRANAD-3, a pan-beta-amyloid fluorescence probe, we discovered abundant nano-scale lymphatic-like vessels (NLVs) in the brain parenchyma of both mouse and human. The majority of these vessels have diameters less than 1000 nanometers and show moderate positivity for several lymphatic biomarkers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, PDPN, and VEGFR3. The NLVs coil around blood vessels and possible connections between blood vessels were observed. Notably, we also found that some NLVs travel through several layers in the cortex and display distinct orientation patterns in different cortical layers. Our discovery reveals a previously hidden vascular system, and raises the possibility that such an abundant and structured web of tubular structures could enable highly efficient means to enhance waste clearance, and could thus play a crucial role in supporting the high metabolic demands of brains.",

      "title": "Ciliary sensing in tanycytes couples nutrient availability to metabolic regulation",
      "content": "Body homeostasis relies on accurate communication between the brain and the periphery. Disruption of this communication can contribute to disease. Tanycytes are located at the interface of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bloodstream, and hypothalamus, where they sense circulating nutrients and regulate neuroendocrine axes and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which they sense CSF signals remain largely unclear. Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice. These findings identify tanycytic cilia as key sensors regulating energy balance.",

      "title": "Fast and slow architectures of cortical dynamics in human brain",
      "content": "The most critical attribute of the brain is its ability to coordinate perception, thoughts, and action across different timescales. A prominent theory holds that the cortex is organized along a unidimensional hierarchy, where higher-order regions operate over longer intrinsic timescales than sensory areas, a view inferred from analytical methods that assume a single, dominant timescale per region. However, whether cortical dynamics are governed by such a singular hierarchy, or instead by multiple concurrent timescales, has remained unclear due to this fundamental methodological constraint. Here, developing an assumption-free spectral analysis of human intracranial recordings, we discover a fundamental dissociation: cortical dynamics are organized into a fast spectral component (~10-100 Hz) and a slow component (<~1-10 Hz). Crucially, only the fast component spatially recapitulates the classic sensory-to-transmodal functional gradient, whereas the slow component lacks gradient and is coupled to cardiac-related neural activity. This dual-timescale architecture, stable across distinct conscious states, demonstrates human cortical dynamics are organized into parallel processing channels, not a single temporal hierarchy. This framework provides a new foundation for understanding dynamical subsystems that link to brain physiology and cognition.",

      "title": "Symmetry constraints on feedback-driven orientation tuning dynamics in translation-invariant models of primate V1",
      "content": "Orientation selectivity in primate V1 is shaped by feedforward drive, intracortical recurrence, and corticocortical feedback. Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.",
