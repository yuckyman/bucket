      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "Repeated fentanyl abstinence intensifies opioid withdrawal and induces a proinflammatory state in striatal microglia",
      "content": "Opioid withdrawal is a serious obstacle to self-initiated abstinence, and previous experiences of opioid withdrawal may exacerbate the severity of subsequent incidences. To study the impact of repeated opioid withdrawal episodes, we compared male and female mice after one or five cycles of fentanyl exposure and withdrawal. We selectively expressed hemagglutinin-tagged ribosomes (RiboTag) in microglia of transgenic mice to immunoprecipitate and sequence RNA actively undergoing translation (the 'translatome') from striatal microglia during fentanyl withdrawal. Key changes were confirmed by RTqPCR of RiboTag RNA. Repeated bouts of fentanyl treatment and withdrawal impacted striatal microglia much more than a single cycle of fentanyl followed by withdrawal. Multiple withdrawal cycles reduced ramification of microglial processes, suggesting a more reactive cell state, and induced more severe behavioral withdrawal signs in mice. Five cycles of fentanyl exposure and withdrawal increased the expression of gene networks associated with innate immunity signaling. Indeed, 100% of the genes associated with the 'microglia core sensome', were upregulated after five cycles of withdrawal. Together these results suggest that mouse striatal microglia initiate a proinflammatory response following five, but not one, opioid exposure and withdrawal experiences and suggest that drug therapies targeting microglial innate immune responses may mitigate the severe withdrawal associated with repeated opioid tolerance and withdrawal.",

This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

While previous work has shown that personality traits shape interpersonal behavior, and that trait similarity can enhance dyadic coordination, little is known about whether such similarity predicts neural synchrony. The present study used an electroencephalography (EEG) hyper-scanning methodology to investigate the relationship between the degree of similarity in Big 5 scores of interacting participants in dyads and their interbrain synchrony during naturalistic dialogue. A total of 23 female dyads completed the Big 5 questionnaire and performed a goal-oriented social task while each wearing lightweight EEG headsets. Similarity for each Big 5 personality scale was created by calculating the absolute difference between the two participants within each dyad. Interpersonal neural synchrony was measured using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which quantified the similarity between separate temporal signals, based on a time-frequency decomposition of EEG. Results showed that similarity of Conscientiousness scores within dyads significantly predicted interpersonal neural synchrony within dyads (with openness showing marginal prediction). No relationship was evident for any other Big 5 trait. These findings demonstrate that personality similarity, particularly in conscientiousness, contributes to interpersonal neural synchrony, highlighting a trait-based pathway through which social alignment emerges during naturalistic interaction.",

      "title": "DeepAttNet: deep neural network incorporating cross-attention mechanism for subject-independent mental stress detection in passive brain\u2013computer interfaces using bilateral ear-EEG",
      "content": "IntroductionElectroencephalography (EEG)-based mental stress detection has the potential to be applied in diverse real-world scenarios, including workplace safety, mental health monitoring, and human\u2013computer interaction. However, most previous passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) studies have employed EEG recorded during the performance of specific tasks, making the classification results susceptible to task engagement effects rather than reflecting stress alone. To address this limitation, we introduce a rest-versus-rest paradigm that compares resting EEG recorded immediately after exposure to a stressor with that recorded after meditation, thereby isolating mental stress from the task-related confounds. EEG recording setups were designed under the assumption of bilateral ear-EEG, a compact and discreet form factor suitable for real-world applications. Furthermore, we developed a novel subject-independent deep learning classifier tailored to model interhemispheric neural dynamics for enhanced mental stress detection performance.MethodsThirty-two adults participated in the experiment. To classify mental stress status in a subject-independent manner, we proposed DeepAttNet, a deep learning model based on cross-attention and pointwise temporal compression, specifically designed to effectively capture left and right hemispherical interactions. Classification performance was assessed using eight-fold subject-level cross-validation against conventional deep learning models, including EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, DeepConvNet, and TSception. Ablation studies evaluated the impact of the cross-attention and/or pointwise compression modules.ResultsDeepAttNet achieved the highest average accuracy and macro-F1 values, with performance declining when either the cross-attention or pointwise compression module was removed in the ablation studies. Explainability analyses indicated lower cross-attention entropy with stronger directional ear-to-ear asymmetry under stress, and temporal occlusion identified mid\u2013late windows supporting stress decisions. Moreover, six of seven canonical scalp-EEG markers were FDR-significant for post-stressor vs. post-relaxation rest.ConclusionThe proposed rest-versus-rest paradigm and DeepAttNet enabled robust, subject-independent mental stress detection with a fairly high accuracy using only two-channel EEG recordings. This approach is expected to offer a practical solution for continuous stress monitoring, potentially advancing passive BCI applications outside laboratory settings.",

      "title": "The cost of language: functionally over-dominant language circuits in the human brain may limit cognitive abilities and non-verbal executive functions",
      "content": "Evolutionarily, the most recent connective system in the human brain is the language circuitry. However, its presence may impose restrictions on higher executive functions apparent as non-verbal talents in art, science, and management\u2013 essentially a conflict between talking and doing. Since the associative cortex underlies thinking, the question then is how much of it is assigned to language functions, and how much is left for associative networks that support non-verbal functions such as planning and parallel processing. Arguments: (i) The determinant of neocortical network organization is the motor cortex, which acts as the main attractor for all processes in the hemispheres yet is split in two sub-attractors formed by disproportionally enlarged zones of origins for two bundles, the corticospinal tract co-driving movements of arms and hands, and the corticobulbar tract to the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves innervating the vocal tract, tongue and face. (ii) This arrangement must entail different functional properties of the associated networks. The language network faces executive limits because the linear generation of words becomes dominated by cerebellar feedback from lingual processing (\u201cone word generates the next\u201d), while the non-verbal networks have more freedom in generating mental goals and movements. (iii) Functional imbalance between these neocortical networks results from altered connections caused by neuronal competition during brain development, either by epigenetic events or by selectable genetic factors. (iv) The descent of the larynx in humans during the paleolithic period and the following self-domestication and neoteny during the last 30,000 years have favored the expansion of the cerebral language network. Voices gained prosody and melody, thereby transmitting fine-grained levels of emotions between individuals, facilitating the evolution of collective cooperation in agricultural economies. On the other hand, with the advent of densely populated kingdom states, emotional voicing also enabled mass control of people for warfare and social stratification of societies. This new environment entailed genetic adaptation of a large population segment resulting in moderately lowered cognition, firstly by expansion of the language network permitting emotional association of simple memes and words, possibly supported by additional mechanisms conserving a child-like stage of brain development responsible for word-linked beliefs.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the sleep\u2013wake circadian rhythm and phenotypic characteristics in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and to explore the relationship and potential mechanisms between sleep\u2013wake phenotypes and circadian rhythm disruption.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with acute ICH admitted to Kailuan General Hospital between January 2020 and December 2024, along with 67 age- and sex-matched hospitalized controls. Sleep parameters during the daytime (06:00\u201318:00) and nighttime (18:00\u201306:00) were collected using a mattress-based sleep monitoring system. Circadian rhythm indices\u2014including interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV), and relative amplitude (RA)\u2014as well as sleep phenotypic features were evaluated.ResultsCompared with the control group, patients with ICH exhibited significantly disrupted circadian rhythms, characterized by reductions in IS, IV, and RA (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Significant alterations in sleep\u2013wake states were observed in both daytime and nighttime periods among ICH patients. These included prolonged/increased durations and proportions of light sleep, deep sleep, NREM sleep, REM sleep, and sleep efficiency, along with shortened/decreased sleep latency, REM latency, and proportion of NREM sleep (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Phenotypic analysis revealed a significantly higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleep, increased total sleep across 24\u202fh, and reversed sleep\u2013wake cycles in the ICH group (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Regression analysis indicated that reduced IS was significantly associated with reversed sleep\u2013wake cycles (OR\u202f=\u202f\u22125.831; 95% CI,: \u221212.577\u202f~\u202f\u22121.350).ConclusionAcute hemorrhagic stroke is associated with excessive sleepiness, disrupted sleep architecture, and weakened circadian rhythms. These disturbances may impair recovery and long-term outcomes, underscoring the need for rhythm-based biomarkers and individualized interventions.",
