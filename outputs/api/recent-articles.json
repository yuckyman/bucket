      "title": "Disentangling motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations and their modulation with rTMS",
      "content": "Cortical beta oscillations are central to motor control. These rhythms are modulated during movement preparation and execution, and are also sensitive to cognitive factors such as uncertainty, attention and reward prediction. However, the distinct motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations-roles that may inform condition-specific therapeutic strategies-remain unclear. This study aimed to disentangle the respective contributions of motor and cognitive functions, and to assess their modulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twenty-four healthy participants performed a visually cued reaching task in which directional uncertainty was dynamically manipulated by varying the number of targets in real-time. Reaction time was quantified as a behavioural measure. Three stimulation conditions were applied during the preparatory periods between the 'uncertainty' and 'go' cues: no stimulation, regular rTMS at each participant's individual beta frequency, and irregular rTMS. Electroencephalography was used to measure beta-band oscillatory activity. Our results showed that 'uncertainty' cues induced bilateral beta suppression, with greater uncertainty linked to smaller reductions in beta power. Movement-related beta modulation was lateralised to the hemisphere contralateral to the executing hand, where elevated beta power in the pre-'go' cue period predicted longer reaction times. Both regular and irregular rTMS significantly shortened reaction times and attenuated beta event-related desynchronisation. Reductions in beta desynchronisation correlated with improvements in reaction times, suggesting beta desynchronisation reflects a neural threshold for movement initiation. These findings indicate that cortical beta oscillations encode distinct motor and cognitive processes, and that beta frequency rTMS can modulate beta dynamics to facilitate faster movement initiation by lowering this neural threshold.",

      "title": "Drosophila maintain a consistent navigational goal angle for days to weeks",
      "content": "Past work has demonstrated that Drosophila can keep to a consistent navigational bearing for minutes to hours. Here, we ask whether they can do so over days to weeks. First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks. Furthermore, the technology introduced here may enable trained behaviors across thousands of reinforcement trials in Drosophila, a paradigm central to mammalian neuroscience yet absent in flies.",

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",
