      "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
      "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

      "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

      "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",

      "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
      "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

      "content": "This study examined the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to measure real-time cognitive engagement during English-speaking tasks among Thai undergraduate students. A total of 41 participants took part in a mock job interview while wearing a five-channel EEG headset, which captured brain activity in the beta and gamma frequency bands. The EEG data were analyzed to identify variations in neural activation associated with speaking performance. Descriptive analyses revealed that participants with higher speaking scores generally exhibited increased beta and gamma wave activity, indicating greater attentional focus and semantic processing. However, nonparametric tests showed no statistically significant differences in neural activation between the lowest- and highest-scoring groups, suggesting that cognitive engagement may not always correspond directly with observable speaking performance. These results emphasize that even lower-performing learners may exhibit strong mental effort during communication, and that EEG can serve as a valuable tool for understanding hidden cognitive processes and informing more personalized language instruction and assessment.",

      "content": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been studied in clinical and laboratory contexts, but the rise of consumer-grade devices now allows exploration of their use in daily activities. Virtual reality (VR) provides a particularly relevant domain, where existing input methods often force trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and physical effort. This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360\u00b0 cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. While the differing confirmation pipelines limit direct comparison of throughput metrics, NeuroGaze is positioned as a feasibility study illustrating trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and accessibility. It highlights the potential of consumer-grade BCIs for long-duration use and emphasizes the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

      "title": "Calibration of MRI-based reference intervals to new samples",
      "content": "Reference intervals, defined as intervals containing a new observation with a specified probability relative to reference data, would be clinically useful in assessing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain charts, which are estimates of MRI phenotypes across covariates such as age and sex, can be used to construct reference intervals. However, the reference data used to fit intervals often differs from a new sample in terms of study design, MRI acquisition, and image preprocessing. Application of MRI reference intervals to new samples remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method called Reference interval calibration via conFormal prediction (ReForm) that adjusts reference intervals for a new sample. Our method builds on recent work in conformal prediction, which yields intervals with guaranteed coverage for new observations. Through resampling experiments in Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium cortical thickness data, we compare ReFormed reference intervals to refitting intervals, statistical harmonization methods, and model-based adjustment of intervals. Notably for patient privacy concerns, ReForm does not require sharing of reference data. Yet, our empirical results demonstrate that ReForm controls FPR similarly or better than alternative methods which require sharing reference data.

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Neural heterogeneity as a unifying mechanism for efficient learning in spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",
