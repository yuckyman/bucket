      "title": "Deliberation is a controllable process governed by desirability and cognitive effort",
      "content": "Humans spend a lifetime making decisions based on incoming sensory information and goals. Prominent theories of perceptual decision-making have described the components of deliberation process, yet they lack a unifying principle that governs how the nervous system tunes the deliberation process across multiple contexts. Desirability (reward) and effort (energy) are major determinants in governing a broad range of human and animal behaviour, such as foraging, walking, and decisions. Here we develop a theory where desirability and cognitive effort tune the control gains that govern deliberation. Several hallmark features of decision behaviour simply emerge from the model, with the deliberation process closely resembling low-dimensional neural dynamics. We also predict and provide a novel mechanistic explanation for ''choking-under-pressure'', where extremely large rewards lead to performance deficits. Our principled framework explains both behavioural and neural phenomena while providing a path to unify disparate fields.",

      "title": "Modeling the effects of Huntington disease on age-related genes reveals CXXC4 as an epigenetic target to restore health and excitability of Drd1-expressing striatal neurons",
      "content": "Gene profile studies suggest that neurons may face premature aging in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease (HD). Cells remodel gene expression to resist molecular damage in aging, but how neurons may engage age-related genes to resist HD remains unknown. Here, we found that transcriptional-aging inversion (TAGI) in the Drd1-expressing striatal neurons (Drd1 SNs) of HD knock-in (Hdh) mice shows discrete patterns in the backdrop of a TAG-like (TAGL) signature, and that TAGI persistence as Hdh mice become strongly symptomatic may better explain disease progression compared to TAGL dynamics. We also found that genes affected by 3prime UTR accumulation in aged mouse Drd1 SNs of aged mice are more likely downregulated in aging and deregulated in Hdh mice. Mapping 3prime UTR data in aging on gene dysregulation networks in the Drd1-SNs of weakly symptomatic Hdh mice highlighted a CAG repeat-dependent network of upregulated genes with compensatory potential as suggested by enrichment in development and maintenance factors such as CTCF. This class noticeably contains Atad-5, a PCNA unloader in the DNA repair complex and a modifier of CAG expansion in the plasma of HD patients. This class also contains CXXC4 (IDAX), an epigenetic regulator and repressor of TET2 activity, for which upregulation is lost in strongly symptomatic Hdh mice. CXXC4 reduces the levels of p16INK4a, a cellular senescence marker, in human iPS cell-derived SNs and restores glutamate excitability in human HD iPS cell-derived SNs. Collectively, these data suggest that the resilience capacity of Drd1 SNs against HD involves discrete patterns of age-related genes, where early intervention based on expressing broad-spectrum genes such as CXXC4 may provide novel therapeutic strategies to restore cortico-striatal homeostasis and function.",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

      "title": "Reevaluating the classification of pediatric speech sound disorders: a ground truthing perspective",
      "content": "Pediatric Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs) are conventionally diagnosed using auditory-perceptual assessments, heavily relying on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions. This approach, while prevalent, is increasingly criticized due to inherent perceptual biases, limited sensitivity to subtle speech motor variations, and insufficient reflection of underlying speech mechanisms. This paper critically re-examines a widely used diagnostic classification system for pediatric SSDs, namely Dodd\u2019s Model of Differential Diagnosis (MDD), emphasizing the limitations of perceptual methods and advocating for instrumental techniques to address significant ground truthing issues. Critical analysis in this paper integrates evidence from perceptual research, instrumental phonetics, and speech motor development studies, highlighting discrepancies between traditional classification methods and modern instrumental data. Findings indicate profound limitations in current auditory-perceptual classification methods, particularly regarding their inability to detect subtle motoric impairments such as jaw sliding, covert motor contrasts, and undifferentiated tongue gestures. Evidence from instrumental studies supports a speech-motor rather than purely cognitive-linguistic basis for many pediatric SSDs, revealing significant inadequacies in current clinical practices. To avoid the narrow interpretation of \u201cmotor speech\u201d as referring only to childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or dysarthria, we explicitly broaden its scope to include a wider range of motoric influences on SSDs. Given these critical ground truthing concerns, the paper proposes adopting instrumental-based methodologies that offer greater precision in identifying underlying motor-based impairments, thereby promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of pediatric SSDs. Furthermore, the discussion advocates for adopting a dimensional rather than categorical classification framework, emphasizing gradual developmental trajectories and foundational speech motor skills. Aligning with modern precision medicine principles, the proposed approach aims to refine diagnostic accuracy, improve intervention effectiveness, and ultimately enhance clinical outcomes for children with SSDs.",
