      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal Divergence Between Intrinsic And Evoked Cortical Activity Predicts Visual Detection.",
      "content": "The threshold for sensory detection varies with fluctuations in intrinsic cortical activity. When stimulus-encoding cortical populations are more excitable, stimuli elicit stronger neural responses that are more likely to be detected. However, the detection of a stimulus is also more likely when cortical populations are less excitable because there is less background 'noise'. Therefore, it is unclear how the variable states of intrinsic and sensory-evoked cortical activity and their interactions impact sensory detection. We hypothesize the answer depends on the spatiotemporal structure of intrinsic activity states across sensory encoding and non-encoding populations. To test this, we examined intrinsic and target-evoked population activity across cortical Area MT in common marmosets while they performed a threshold visual detection task. We compared detection performance based on target-evoked responses and the state of intrinsic activity in the larger surrounding population. We find that the intrinsic activity in the surrounding, non-encoding population predicted trial-by-trial detection performance better than the population encoding the target evoked response. Furthermore, we find that the detection performance of the monkey was best predicted by the divergence in excitability between the encoding and surrounding non-encoding population. These findings suggest that, rather than a source of noise or irrelevant to sensory processing, the distributed spatiotemporal state of intrinsic activity directly influences how sensory signals are represented in cortical populations and can influence perceptual thresholds in visual detection.",

      "title": "Good dog, bad wolf: Debunking evolutionary preparedness to fear wolves",
      "content": "The return of wolves to historical ranges often causes strong opposition, contrasting with widespread affection for domestic dogs. Evolutionary accounts suggest this discrepancy stems from deeply ingrained affective responses that predispose humans to fear wolves while fostering positive attachment to dogs. Using neuroimaging and self-report data from 42 participants, we investigated how defensive neural circuits linked to implicit threat detection are related to explicit threat evaluations of the two species. During functional MRI, participants viewed images of wolves, dogs, and snakes - the latter chosen for their strong engagement of predisposed threat-related responses - displaying either aggressive or non-aggressive behaviours. As predicted, aggressive displays of all species elicited stronger neural responses in threat-related brain areas. Snakes elicited stronger subcortical threat responses than wolves or dogs, while neural responses to wolves and dogs were largely indistinguishable when comparing aggressive displays. However, explicit threat evaluations strongly differed: wolves were perceived and rated as significantly more threatening than dogs, especially when the species exhibited aggressive displays. Together, these findings challenge accounts that humans are predisposed for negative responses to wolves, suggesting instead that our attitudes towards the species are shaped primarily by deliberate-evaluative processes rather than by implicit-automatic threat responses. This underscores the role of experience, knowledge, stereotypes, and socio-cultural mechanisms in shaping public perceptions of human-wildlife conflicts and conservation efforts. These results provide new insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of human-animal relationships, informing efforts to improve human-wildlife coexistence.",

      "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

      "content": "This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) are able to perform tasks which require higher-order theory of mind (ToM)\u2014the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g., I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",
