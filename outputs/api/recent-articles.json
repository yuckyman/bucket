      "title": "The Turbulent Brain: a toolbox to compute the turbulent dynamical behaviour of whole-brain activity",
      "content": "Brain disorders remain one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. Computational precision medicine offers a promising framework to reveal the mechanistic principles governing both healthy and pathological brain dynamics. In this context, we present The Turbulent Brain (TTB) toolbox, an open-source MATLAB platform that implements and disseminates the turbulence framework for immediate and widespread application in neuroscience research. The toolbox combines model-free and model-based analyses through an intuitive graphical interface, enabling customizable workflows across different parcellations and preprocessing pipelines. Our toolbox builds on recent advances demonstrating that turbulence physics can effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity as a high-dimensional system operating far from equilibrium. This framework allows researchers to explore how fundamental mechanisms are modulated across distinct brain states and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including disorders of consciousness and major depressive disorder. As an illustrative application case, we used TTB to analyse fMRI data from 176 individuals from the Human Connectome Project during resting state and movie watching, showing that movie watching, as compared to resting state, significantly reduces information transmission in terms of turbulence measures, with stronger reductions observed during Creative Commons movie watching compared to Hollywood movies. In summary, the TTB toolbox establishes an accessible framework providing a methodological bridge between nonlinear physics and computational neuroscience, offering new tools for investigating psychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

      "title": "Population Morphology Implies a Common Developmental Blueprint for Drosophila Motion Detectors",
      "content": "Quantitative analysis of neuron morphology is essential in order to develop our understanding of circuit organisation and development. The recent acquisition of whole-brain electron microscopy-based (EM) reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system now provide the resolution needed to examine morphology at scale. Utilising these data, together with new computational tools, we extract and analyse the dendrites of all T4 and T5 neurons within one hemisphere (n [~] 6000). T4 and T5 neurons are the first uniquely direction-selective neurons in the visual pathway, and are classified into four subtypes (a,b,c, and d). Each subtype encodes one of four cardinal motion directions (up, down, forwards, backwards). The dendrites of these neurons form in two distinct neuropils, the Medulla (T4) and the Lobula (T5), and are asymmetrically oriented in a direction inverse to the direction of motion which they encode. However, their densely overlapping and compact arbours has made rigorous morphological quantification challenging. The presence of differences beyond their characteristic orientation, both between T4 and T5, as well as within subtypes, has remained poorly understood. Our analysis reveals a high degree of structural similarity across both types and subtypes. Particularly, measures of geometry and graph topology show only minor variation, with no consistent separation between T4 and T5, or their subtypes. These results indicate that, despite forming in different neuropils, and serving distinct motion directions, T4 and T5 dendrites follow closely aligned morphological patterns. This suggests that their arborization may be governed by shared developmental constraints and mechanisms.",

      "title": "Microstructural functional coupling as a multimodal biomarker of emotional state transitions in bipolar disorder",
      "content": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by dynamic transitions between depressive and manic states, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these state shifts remain unclear. Here, we developed an integrative framework to quantify the microstructural functional coupling (MFC) of the brain, which captures the distributional similarity between voxel wise diffusion and functional features within each cortical region. Using multimodal MRI data from 72 BD patients and 65 matched healthy controls, we observed a global increase of MFC of BD, which indicates a desimilarity of brain microstructure and function. Partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis revealed that the principal latent component linking MFC to behavioral scores explained 67.2% of the variance, with the strongest contributions from the control and somatosensory networks. Mediation analysis demonstrated that regional MFC influenced anxiety indirectly through depressive symptoms, supporting a sequential affective transition from depression to anxiety. Moreover, macroscale gradient analysis showed that the principal MFC gradient was significantly correlated with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, including A4B2, 5 HT1B, and H3. Together, these findings highlight MFC as a multimodal biomarker sensitive to emotional state transitions in BD and suggest its potential as a bridge between microstructural alterations, functional dynamics, and neurotransmitter systems.",

      "title": "Delta Opioid Receptors on Parvalbumin Neurons are Necessary for the Convulsant and Anxiolytic Effects of the Delta Agonist SNC80",
      "content": "The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is expressed broadly throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Activation of DOR by exogenous and endogenous ligands regulates pain, motivation, emotion and memory, but the cells and neural circuits mediating these behavioral effects remain poorly characterized. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons express high levels of DOR transcript (OPRD1) and protein (Birdsong et al 2019). Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons also play a role in pain and emotional processing, suggesting that DOR signaling on PV interneurons may modulate these behaviors. To address this question we used a conditional knockout mouse line (Floxed DOR; PV-cre) to delete DOR from PV-expressing cells. First, we validated the functional loss of DOR through whole-cell electrophysiology experiments. Next, we characterized baseline behavioral phenotypes and the convulsant, pro-locomotive and anxiolytic-like behavioral responses induced by the DOR agonist SNC80 in Floxed DOR; PV-Cre mice and their littermate controls. Interestingly, we found that the convulsant and anxiolytic effects of the DOR agonist SNC80 were diminished in Floxed DOR;PV Cre animals. However, baseline behavioral phenotypes, SNC80-induced spontaneous hyperlocomotion and respiratory stimulation were conserved. These novel findings indicate that the pro-convulsant and anxiolytic effects of DOR agonists are anatomically separable from the locomotor stimulating effects and are dependent on DOR expression on PV interneurons.",

      "title": "Gene network inference and master regulator analysis identifies the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3) as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder (AUD).",
      "content": "Differential gene expression is often inadequate to predict the activity of transcription factors and their contribution to the phenotypes associated with specific gene expression states. Here we used a systems biology approach based on gene network inference and master regulator analysis (MRA) to identify candidate drivers of the gene network dysregulations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of human subjects with a history of alcohol dependence. The estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR{gamma}) gene ESRRG, an orphan nuclear receptor protein that acts as a transcription activator, emerged as a high-ranking Master Regulator (MR) based on the expression of its targets and was selected for functional validation due to its translational and druggability potential. The ERR{gamma} agonist, GSK4716, reduced alcohol drinking in the mouse binge drinking paradigm of drinking in the dark (DID) and in both non-dependent mice as well as in mice made dependent by chronic intermittent vapor exposure (CIE). GSK4716 also prevented alcohol-conditioned place preference without affecting saccharin intake or mouse locomotion. Similarly, in rats, GSK4716 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in non-dependent and dependent (by CIE) rats under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. Overall, these results support the efficacy of transcriptome-wide gene regulatory network approaches for the identification of key druggable regulators of long-term transcriptional adaptations that sustain the molecular and behavioral pathology of alcohol dependence and identify ERR{gamma} as a regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and seeking, and a therapeutic target for AUD.",

      "title": "Deep Learning for Cognitive Task Presence Prediction from Dynamic Functional Connectivity",
      "content": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) studies the time-varying coordination between brain regions measured with fMRI and is a potential biomarker for understanding cognitive dynamics and tracking the development of neurological disorders. However, a critical methodological challenge lies in the variability of dFC estimates across different dFC assessment methods, raising concerns about the reliability and interpretation of downstream findings. While deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated the ability to capture traditionally inaccessible data patterns in many disciplines, they encounter challenges when applied to neuroimaging data. For instance, the high dimensionality, noise, and temporal complexity inherent in dFC makes it challenging for DL models to extract meaningful and interpretable insights. In this study, we investigated how DL architectures can be developed and adapted to predict task presence over time from task-based dFC data, and additionally, how the choice of dFC assessment method influences the predictive performance of DL models. We developed and compared a convolutional neural network (CNN), a node-level classification graph convolutional network (GCN), and a graph-level classification GCN based on their ability to predict time points at which subjects were performing a cognitive task or at rest. In our study, the results indicate that both DL model architecture and dFC estimation methodology significantly impact task presence prediction capacity, while the specific task paradigm had minimal influence out of the limited types that were explored. This work offers a powerful benchmark for understanding the dynamics of underlying task-driven cognitive state transitions and the analytical flexibility limitations of dFC estimation methods and DL architectures.",

      "title": "Numerosity Is Directly Sensed and Dynamically Transformed in the Human Brain: Evidence from MEG-MRI Fusion",
      "content": "Humans can estimate the number of objects in a scene within a fraction of a second, suggesting that numerosity is encoded rapidly and directly by the visual system. Yet how this encoding unfolds over time and interacts with other visual features remains unclear. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) and MEG-fMRI fusion to track how numerosity is represented in the brain over time. We also used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize the evolving patterns of neural activity. Two main findings emerged. First, numerosity exhibited the hallmarks of a primary perceptual attribute: its neural signature appeared rapidly after stimulus onset, preceding the encoding of non-numeric features that could otherwise define number. Second, Visualization of the neural patterns using MDS suggested a temporal transformation in representational geometry, reflecting the engagement of two distinct coding schemes- an early, linear number line, consistent with a \"summation code\", dominating activity in occipital regions, and a later, curved number line, consistent with \"numerosity-tuned code\", emerging more strongly in associative areas along the dorsal stream. Together, these findings demonstrate that numerosity processing is encoded directly from the visual image and unfolds through a rapid hierarchical transformation, from a broad quantity signal to a finely tuned, number-specific code, linking perceptual encoding to higher-level numerical abstraction.",

      "title": "UCM-A86 is a selective positive allosteric modulator of GluN1/GluN3 NMDA receptors",
      "content": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) where they play critical roles in normal and pathological brain functions and neurodevelopment. While the glutamate/glycine-activated GluN2-containing NMDA receptors (GluN1/GluN2) have been extensively studied, the physiological roles and pharmacology of glycine-activated GluN3-containing receptors (GluN1/GluN3) remain less understood. Although GluN1/GluN3 receptors exhibit unique functional properties and play distinct roles in neuronal development and synapse maturation, studies of their precise roles in neurophysiology and circuit function are impeded by limited availability of GluN3-selective pharmacological tools. This study describes UCM-A86, a novel GluN3-selective positive allosteric modulator, with EC50 values of 21 M and 19 M at GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors, respectively. UCM-A86 selectively potentiates recombinant GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors by 436% and 174%, respectively, relative to activation by glycine, with no activity at recombinant GluN1/GluN2A-D receptors. Furthermore, UCM-A86 selectively potentiates responses from native GluN1/GluN3A receptors expressed in somatostatin-expressing interneurons of the somatosensory cortex with no modulation of hippocampal AMPA receptor- and GluN1/2 NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mechanistic studies suggest that UCM-A86 modulation is facilitated by agonist binding (or channel gating) and that UCM-A86 primarily potentiates GluN1/GluN3A by increasing open probability with no effects on mean channel conductance. These findings advance the synthetic pharmacology of GluN1/GluN3 receptors and provide a novel tool for modulation of native GluN3-containing NMDA receptors.",

      "title": "Short trains of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation increase online corticospinal excitability and pupil size in humans",
      "content": "Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a method for interrogating the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine system in human behavior. Tuning of excitability in the corticospinal tract is central to many cognitive and motor processes, but little is known about how the LC contributes to this tuning. In particular, no existing studies have examined the effect of tVNS on corticospinal excitability 'online' during active stimulation, where the largest effects on pupil size are observed. Method: To address this question, we delivered repeated 4-second trains of tVNS and sham stimulation and elicited MEPs during stimulation trains (online) and shortly after train offset (offline). Pupil size was concurrently recorded throughout each train. Results: We discovered that tVNS significantly increases corticospinal excitability compared to sham stimulation, but only when measured online and not offline. The excitatory effects on corticospinal excitability were greater in the latter half of tVNS trains. Pupil size was also significantly increased by tVNS compared to sham; however, the effect on pupil size peaked earlier during the tVNS trains compared to corticospinal excitability. In line with these distinct temporal profiles, changes in corticospinal excitability and pupil size were not significantly correlated, likely reflecting differences in the anatomical circuits underpinning each effect. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that tVNS increases corticospinal excitability at rest, but the effect only emerges when corticospinal excitability is measured online during active tVNS. Implications for basic and clinical neuroscientific research are discussed.",

      "title": "Repeat Opioid Use Modulates Microglia Activity and Amyloid Beta Clearance in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "In addition to driving dependency and overdose, illicit use of opioids, such as fentanyl, is linked to the risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Growing evidence also indicates that opioid use is associated with pathological features, paralleled early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which raises the possibility of the involvement of mechanistic interactions between opioid use and AD progression. Here, we investigate how chronic fentanyl use (i.e., 20 days) influences the neuroimmune state, microglial activity, and amyloid burden in wildtype and APPPS1-21 mice, a transgenic model of AD. In wild-type mice, fentanyl use promoted a pro-inflammatory state without increasing the incidence of disease-associated microglia. In APPPS1-21 mice, chronic fentanyl use led to a shift favoring an anti-inflammatory state, which was associated with increased microglia clustering and activation at A{beta} plaques, increased A{beta} internalization in plaque-associated activated microglia, decreased soluble A{beta}, and decreased plaque burden. Our findings indicate that chronic fentanyl use fundamentally changes the trajectory of neuroimmune activity and features characteristic of early AD by enabling microglia to enhance A{beta} clearance. The interactions demonstrate how substance use can reshape the neuroimmune landscape in neurodegenerative disease, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",
