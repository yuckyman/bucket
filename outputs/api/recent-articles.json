      "title": "Propagation Mapping: A Precision Framework for Reconstructing the Neural Circuitry of Brain Maps",
      "content": "Human brain mapping has traditionally relied on univariate approaches to characterize regional activity, an assumption that is increasingly being challenged. While functional connectivity offers a promising alternative, it fails to capture signal amplitude, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the brain biological organization. The current study introduced and validated propagation mapping, a novel framework designed to reconstruct the neural circuitry underlying human brain maps. By modeling the interdependence of regional signal amplitude and connectivity, the spatial organization of brain maps could be predicted with near-perfect accuracy. This precision remained stable across task contrasts, parcellation atlases, and both short- and long-range connections. Critically, propagation mapping preserved each individual functional fingerprint, enabling reliable study of inter-individual differences in brain behavior relationships. As a biologically informed and accessible representation of brain organization, propagation mapping provides a powerful alternative to traditional regional analyses and opens new avenues for discovery in neurological and psychiatric neuroimaging research.",

      "title": "Cortical myelination networks reflect neuronal gene expression and track adolescent age in marmosets",
      "content": "Structural similarity provides a powerful framework for measuring coordinated macro- and microstructural variation across the cortex of a single brain. Similarity networks derived from myelin-sensitive MRI sequences undergo marked reorganisation during adolescence, linked to psychosocial outcomes in humans and rodents. However, the cellular mechanisms of myelination similarity and its development in non-human primate cortex remain unexplored. Here, we used myelin-sensitive T1w/T2w ratio images from a cross-sectional sample of 446 common marmosets (aged 0.62 to 12.75 years) to estimate cortical similarity networks in individual animals. Cortical areas with similar myeloarchitecture showed highly similar patterns of gene co-expression in glutamatergic neurons and PV+ and VIP+ interneurons, reflecting the activity dependence of myelination. A reliable age-based signal exists within network features, with coordinated developmental trajectories observed across the cortical hierarchy from primary to transmodal association cortices - a pattern that mirrors findings in human cortex. Taken together, marmosets demonstrate phylogenetically conserved patterns of myelination network development, potentially underpinned by key neuronal cell types that shape the functional specialisation of cortical areas.",

However, challenges such as manual data collection, multipath interference, and poor cross-domain generalization hinder real-world deployment. Existing data augmentation approaches often neglect the biomechanical structure underlying RF signals. To address these limitations, we present CM-GR, a...",

      "content": "The structural integrity of poultry eggs is essential for food safety, economic value, and hatchability. External eggshell quality-measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness-is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of...",

Although several machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, accident detection systems are not widely deployed, and most existing solutions fail to handle the growing complexity of modern traffic environments. This study introduces Collaborative Intelligence for Road Safety (CIRS), a novel, multi-agent,...",

      "content": "Achieving rapid and accurate object classification holds significant importance in various domains. However, conventional vision-based techniques suffer from several limitations, including high data redundancy and strong dependence on image quality. In this work, we present a high-speed, image-free object classification method based on dual-pixel measurement and normalized central moment invariants. Leveraging the complementary modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD), the...",
