      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Barry and I've built Prism.Tools (<a href=\"https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/</a>) \u2013 a collection of client-side developer utilities that respect your privacy.<p>Many of these tools were used way back in the days when I ran a BBS and started my communities first ISP, serving three local communities with Dial-Up Internet, Web Hosting etc. The tools have been refined to reflect the changes in tech since then and designed for the Novice and Pro alike. As I locate more tools others may find useful I will refine and add them to the collection. Use them, Share them, or not. They will be here if you need them...<p>40+ dev tools (JSON formatters, regex tester, base64 encoder, Git command helper, etc.) that run entirely in your browser.\nZero tracking, zero analytics, zero data collection \u2013 everything processes locally.\nSelf-contained HTML files with no build process or frameworks.<p>I realized I had a lot of tools/utilities I've built over the years for my own use. I lothe having to 'sign-up' just to access/use simple utilities that I can create myself. I've refined them and put them in one safe place so I could easily access them if/when needed. I decided to make them available via Github Pages for anyone that may find them useful. Prism.Tools is the result.<p>Each tool is a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks, no npm packages, no build steps \u2013 just open the file and it works.<p>The entire toolset:<p>- 100% client-side processing \u2013 your data never leaves your browser.<p>- No external dependencies except for specific libraries from cdnjs.cloudflare.com (marked.js for markdown, exifr for image metadata, etc.)<p>- Consistent dark UI \u2013 every tool follows the same design language for familiarity.<p>- Vanilla JS where possible \u2013 only reaching for Public CDN Resources when necessary.<p>The constraint of \"single HTML file\" was intentional. It forces simplicity and ensures tools remain maintainable. It also means users can inspect, modify, or self-host any tool trivially.<p>These tools have helped me with debugging production issues, Quick formatting tasks, learning Git commands (the Git command helper has been particularly helpful)<p>Just visit <a href=\"https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/</a> and try any tool. No signup, no install.<p>What tools are missing that you find yourself needing?\nAny performance issues with specific tools?\nUI/UX friction points?<p>All tools follow the same privacy-first philosophy...\nYour data stays in your browser. No accounts, no tracking, no servers processing your information.\nThe project is also a demonstration that you don't always need React, Vue, or complex build pipelines \u2013 sometimes vanilla JavaScript in a single HTML file is exactly the right tool for the job.<p>Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)\nCSS3 with CSS Grid\nMinimal external libraries: marked.js, exifr, highlight.js, sql-formatter (all from CDN)\nNo frameworks, no bundlers, no npm\nHosted on Github Pages<p>Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, design decisions, or specific tools!<p>All tools are inspectable \u2013 just view source on any page to see exactly how they work!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511469\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511469</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>",

      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
