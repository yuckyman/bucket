Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "content": "Neurons are highly polarised cells that depend on mitochondria for energy and signalling homeostasis. Importantly, energy and signalling requirements vary considerably across individual neurons both spatially and temporally. Therefore, to fully understand neuronal mitochondria, methods are needed to analyse mitochondria in live cells over time. The nanotweezer, a minimally invasive single-cell sampling technique, enables precise extraction a individual mitochondria from defined subcellular locations. Here, we combine single-mitochondrial extraction from live neurons with mitochondrial gene expression tracking and mtDNA profiling. By tracking mitochondrial gene expression in the same neurons over time, we reveal a downregulation of mitochondrial genes MT-ND1 and MT-ATP6 following exposure to -synuclein aggregates, independent of the proximity of the aggregates to the sampled mitochondria. Our approach provides precise, dynamic measurements of mitochondrial composition and gene expression in vivo at single-organelle resolution, enabling mechanistic studies of neuronal mitochondrial heterogeneity and its perturbation in models of neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) is a rare but devastating clinical variant characterized by abrupt cognitive decline, yet the molecular features underlying this phenotype remain unknown. Tau oligomers (TauO) are key mediators of tau toxicity, but whether their biochemical properties differ across AD subtypes has not been examined in human brain. We isolated endogenous TauO from frontal cortex of well-characterized control, slowly progressive AD (spAD), and rpAD cases using T22 immunoprecipitation and performed ultrastructural, biochemical, and proteomic characterization. rpAD TauO displayed compact, densely aggregated morphology and exhibited the highest levels of disease-associated phosphorylation (pS396, pS422). Label-free proteomics revealed that control and spAD shared a robust TauO interactome enriched for translation, proteostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and vesicle trafficking. Strikingly, these modules were absent in rpAD, which instead showed selective enrichment for aldehyde detoxification, amino-acid and carbon metabolism, and actin-regulatory pathways. rpAD TauO demonstrated increased association with SERPINA1, ALDH9A1, MAPRE3, DPYSL2/3, and NFASC, and reduced association with MRPL17 and C9. Functionally, rpAD TauO induced the strongest toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these findings indicate that rpAD likely harbors a biochemically distinct TauO species, defining a molecular signature that may underpin its fulminant clinical progression and support the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.",

      "content": "Proper entrainment of the body's circadian rhythms to the environment is critical to human health. Light is one of the strongest cues driving circadian photoentrainment of the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via projections from the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Circadian research has historically centered males, and recent work has revealed multiple sex-differences in circadian circuitry and function, indicating that our understanding of this system in females is severely limited. Moreover, while recent studies have investigated the role of hormonal modulation of light responses, the additional possibility that ipRGC inputs may also be sex-dependent has not been directly tested. Here, we report that not only do ipRGCs in female mice show higher levels of melanopsin expression, but that melanopsin also plays a larger role in shaping circadian photic responses in females compared to males. Collectively, these results define a new retinal source for sex-dependent differences in circadian behavior.",

      "content": "Neuropeptides contribute to the functional complexity of the nucleus accumbens, and evaluating the mechanisms by which they influence reward neurocircuitry may reveal novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the role of the neuropeptide precursor VGF (non-acronymic) in the nucleus accumbens, and its contribution to synaptic and opioid-evoked plasticity and behavior. We first characterized VGF expression within the nucleus accumbens, then examined its impact on excitatory synaptic transmission, and finally disrupted its expression to assess its influence on opioid sensitivity. We found that VGF is expressed by interneurons and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, and the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 reduced excitatory synaptic transmission onto nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons. Conditional genetic knockout of VGF from the nucleus accumbens did not affect acute opioid sensitivity, but amplified opioid-evoked psychomotor sensitization following chronic fentanyl exposure. These results establish VGF as a modulator of nucleus accumbens synaptic and drug-evoked plasticity. Uncovering the impact of VGF on nucleus accumbens plasticity following exogenous opioid exposure may lead to novel therapeutic targets to treat opioid use disorders.",

      "title": "Functional implications of compartment-specific homeostatic regulation and the feasibility of independent local feedback signals",
      "content": "Neurons regulate their average firing rate by adjusting their synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability. Both forms of homeostatic regulation utilize changes in intracellular calcium as a feedback signal to adjust ion channel densities. But two properties cannot be independently regulated using a single feedback signal, suggesting that either synaptic scaling and excitability regulation are linked by a shared feedback signal or that local calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Past studies on homeostatic regulation have focused on global calcium changes but spatially restricted calcium changes also occur. We hypothesized that local perturbation-induced calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Simulations in a simple two-compartment model confirmed that a perturbation applied to one or the other compartment induces local compensation only if the feedback is compartment-specific. Simulations in a biophysically detailed multicompartment model with realistic calcium handling confirmed that dendritic and somatic calcium signals remain relatively segregated and can, therefore, mediate homoeostatic regulation independently in subcellular compartments. Strong perturbations (as often tested experimentally) triggered widespread compensation because local compensation was overwhelmed. Non-local compensation also occurred when the spatial segregation of calcium signaling was weakened. Our results demonstrate the plausibility of spatially segregated calcium changes encoding separate feedback signals so that homeostatic changes can be locally controlled. Our results also highlight that whereas local homeostatic regulation nullifies local perturbations through compensation within the affected compartment, non-local regulation causes widespread compensatory changes that, while restoring the neuron's overall input-output relationship, distorts the input-output relationship of individual compartments, with potentially important consequences.",

      "title": "Neuronal APOE4 reduction with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within the central nervous system (CNS), APOE is produced by a variety of cell types, with differential roles in AD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that APOE4 produced by neurons plays a central role in promoting the development of major AD pathologies, including p-tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role as an upstream initiating factor that affects other cell types and downstream AD-related pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting APOE-I3, a neuron-specific splicing variant of APOE mRNA, effectively reduce APOE expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Treating PS19 tauopathy mice expressing APOE4 with this APOE-I3-targeting ASO reduces neuronal APOE4, rescues neurodegeneration, and diminishes neuroinflammation. Strikingly, the extent of neuronal APOE4 reduction predicts the efficacy of rescuing neurodegeneration. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated that APOE-I3-targeting ASO treatment decreases disease associated neuronal and glial subtypes and increases a disease-protective microglial subtype. These findings suggest that preferential knockdown of neuronal APOE4 with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against key hallmarks of AD pathology, elucidating a potential therapeutic approach for treating APOE4-driven AD.",

      "title": "TARGETING 5-HT7 RECEPTOR WITH BIASED LIGANDS TO ALLEVIATE PAIN AND SPINAL NEUROINFLAMMATION",
      "content": "The serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and represents a promising target for treating CNS disorders such as sleep disturbances, migraine, neuropsychiatric conditions, and neuropathic pain. Owing to its therapeutic potential, extensive efforts have focused on developing selective 5-HT7R ligands. In the last decades, biased signalling has emerged as a key concept in GPCR pharmacology as biased ligands can stabilize specific active states of the receptor and trigger selective activation of downstream signaling pathways. In this context, we recently identified two biased 5-HT7R ligands, Serodolin and MOA51, from different chemical series. Here, we aimed to compare the pharmacological and safety profiles of these ligands and to assess their effect on pain-related behaviors and spinal neuroinflammation. In inflammatory pain models (acid acetic writhing, formalin and CFA tests), both serodolin and MOA51 effectively attenuated pain responses to a similar extend. Furthermore, in neuropathic pain models, spinal nerve injury (SNI) and Cuff model, both ligands reversed mechanical allodynia. Interestingly, unlike pregabalin, a clinically used reference drug, neither Serodolin nor MOA51 induced apparent tolerance after 10 consecutive days of administration. Treatment with these 5-HT7R ligands also reduced spinal microglial and attenuated neuronal hyperactivity in the spinal cord. Altogether these findings highlight the potential of 5-HT7R-biased ligands as promising analgesic candidates capable of modulating neuroinflammatory processes and mitigating both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.",

      "content": "Previous brain wide association studies (BWAS) cross sectionally linked a specific behavioral trait, most commonly IQ or psychopathology, to variation in brain function or structure. Here, we expanded the focus of BWAS from effect sizes to interpretability and generalizability by mapping 649 variables to brain function and structure. We compared the resultant BWAS maps to other types of brain data to annotate the BWAS patterns. Socioeconomic status (SES), not IQ or psychopathology, showed the strongest associations with both resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cortical thickness in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. A principal exposome brain pattern, anchored to sensory and motor cortex, captured 34% of the variance across all BWAS maps. This exposome pattern was strongly correlated with the SES and IQ BWAS maps and non BWAS maps of sleep (EEG), norepinephrine (PET), and stimulants (drug trial), but not cognitive activation maps (task fMRI). Adjusting for SES, reduced brain with IQ associations by 40%. Brain with IQ associations did not generalize, as they could no longer be detected in subsamples drawn from only higher SES backgrounds, while brain with SES associations remained strong in higher IQ only subsamples. These findings reveal SES as the principal axis of population level brain variation, possibly stemming from the sleep deprivation and heightened stress associated with lower SES, since socioeconomics can only indirectly affect the brain.",
