      "title": "Transcranial 1064-nm laser photobiomodulation modulates frequency-specific cortical source dynamics and functional connectivity in healthy adults",
      "content": "IntroductionTranscranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) with near-infrared light is a promising non-invasive method to enhance cognition and support brain health. However, its mechanistic effects on large-scale cortical dynamics remain poorly understood. Establishing how tPBM reorganizes oscillatory hierarchies is critical for advancing both neuroscience and clinical translation.MethodsWe examined whether acute 1,064-nm tPBM modulates oscillatory power, dipole source trajectories, and functional connectivity in the human brain. Simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded in 25 healthy adults before and after prefrontal tPBM. Distributed source imaging (sLORETA) and global optimization dipole modeling characterized spatiotemporal alpha and beta activity. Connectivity was assessed with phase transfer entropy, and infra-slow phase\u2013amplitude coupling analyses assessed hierarchical modulation.ResultsTranscranial photobiomodulation induced frequency-specific reorganization of cortical networks. Alpha oscillations engaged coordinated fronto\u2013visual circuits, whereas beta activity preferentially recruited higher-order executive regions. Source imaging revealed a post-stimulation shift from default mode toward central executive network dominance with stronger directed interactions. Infra-slow rhythms (<0.1 Hz), encompassing both very-low-frequency (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) and ultra-slow (<0.01 Hz) activity, significantly modulated alpha- and beta-band amplitudes, embedding faster oscillations within slower temporal patterns.DiscussionThe findings of his work indicate that tPBM influences intrinsic brain activity by reorganizing oscillatory patterns and shifting network engagement. The redistribution from default mode toward executive systems, along with the nesting of faster rhythms within slower temporal structures, reflects a capacity for large-scale functional rebalancing. The results highlight tPBM\u2019s potential as a precision neuromodulation tool for modulating executive and cognitive control systems.",

      "title": "Impact of sex differences on clinical characteristics of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis during the acute phase: a single-center retrospective study",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo elucidate the influence of sex differences on the clinical characteristics of anti-NMDAR encephalitis during the acute phase.MethodsPatients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who were hospitalized at Huanhu Hospital, affiliated with Tianjin University, from January 2020 to January 2025 were collected. They were divided into two groups: male and female. Clinical data for both groups were gathered, including age, history of prodromal infection, clinical manifestations, complications, presence of tumor, laboratory indices, MRI findings, GCS scores, length of hospital stay, treatment regimens, and acute phase outcomes. Statistical methods were employed to compare the differences between the two groups.ResultsA total of 43 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis were included in this study, comprising 20 male patients (46.51%) and 23 female patients (53.49%). Female patients were more likely to exhibit decreased levels of consciousness compared to male patients (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.113, p\u202f=\u202f0.043). Additionally, the antibody titers in CSF of female patients were significantly higher than those in male patients too (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.870, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Interestingly, CSF protein levels were higher in male patients than in female patients (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.591, p\u202f=\u202f0.019), and male patients were more prone to test positive for anti-MOG antibodies (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f5.715, p\u202f=\u202f0.017). The treatment improvement rate for female patients was lower than that for male patients (Z\u202f=\u202f4.768, p\u202f=\u202f0.029), and family members of female patients were more likely to automatic discharge (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.075, p\u202f=\u202f0.044).ConclusionFemale patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis experience greater challenges and difficulties compared to male patients. Therefore, it is necessary to choose more proactive treatment options for female patients to help reduce the risk of adverse outcome in acute phase.",

      "content": "IntroductionBinaural beat (BB) stimulation has been shown to enhance working memory (WM); however, its role in information segregation and neural processing mechanisms remains insufficiently explored. This study hypothesized that improvements in WM recall are associated with enhanced \u03b8-band\u2013mediated information segregation in frontal brain regions.MethodsSixty healthy participants were randomly assigned to three BB stimulation groups: Group A (\u03b1-BB, 10 Hz), Group B (\u03b2-BB, 14 Hz), and Group C (\u03b3-BB, 30 Hz). Electroencephalography (EEG; 14 channels, 128 Hz sampling rate) was recorded before (Pre), during (Du), and after (Post) BB stimulation. Cognitive performance was assessed using a digit-span test. EEG power spectra and graph-theoretical network metrics were analyzed across \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 frequency bands. Correlations between EEG measures and cognitive changes were computed, and paired t-tests were used to compare Pre-, Du-, and Post-BB conditions.Results\u03b8-band activity showed a significant positive correlation with cognitive improvements, particularly in frontal and parietal regions. Group A demonstrated significant increases in \u03b8-band clustering coefficient and local efficiency at both global and fronto-parietal network levels, along with enhanced in-degree and out-degree centrality. Group C exhibited increased \u03b8-band clustering coefficient during the Post-BB phase and greater betweenness centrality in fronto-parietal regions. No comparable effects were observed in Group B.DiscussionThe findings indicate that BB stimulation, particularly at \u03b1 and \u03b3 frequencies, enhances WM performance through \u03b8-band\u2013mediated improvements in brain network efficiency and information segregation. These results support the potential of BB stimulation as a non-pharmacological approach for cognitive enhancement and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying WM modulation.",

In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03546v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03534v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03444v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03273v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.00911v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.",
