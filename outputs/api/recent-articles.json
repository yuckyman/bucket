      "content": "Opioid misuse remains rampant as new synthetic opioids reach the market. Large-scale genetic tools like the GWAS identify previously unrecognized targets and biomarkers in opioid misuse with hopes of combating the opioid epidemic. One such target is the AMPAR auxiliary protein Cornichon Homolog-3 (human analog: CNIH3, mouse analog: Cnih3), which determines AMPAR subunit composition and kinetics. Though CNIH3 was identified as a gene of interest in OUD, its role in opioid use and accompanying risk factors has not been studied. Using mice with Cnih3 deletion, we assess the role of CNIH3 in risk factors for opioid use, cognition, and opioid use itself. We find that Cnih3 deletion moderately impairs spatial memory, reward-cue association, and reversal learning. Cnih3 deletion also impairs fentanyl-cue association and blunts fentanyl intake during IVSA. We use principal component analysis to pinpoint the dimensions in which Cnih3 deletion impacts behavior in an unbiased manner. Additionally, we identify in previously published human data that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are more protective against progression to daily opioid use in women than in men, suggesting a potential sex-specific role of CNIH3. These findings highlight an important role of CNIH3 in opioid use through learning and memory processes that may differ between males and females.",

      "title": "Decoding brain-wide signatures of uninformed choices for BCI assisted decision-making",
      "content": "Decision-making is an essential cognitive function. It can be impaired due to a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as external factors such as time pressure or stress. To assist users during decision-making, we propose a decision-making brain computer interface (BCI) that can alert to uninformed decision-making, prompt additional information seeking and therefore improve decision-making quality. To this aim, we establish the feasibility of decoding uninformed decision-making from local field potentials recorded with implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes in 6 participants. We show that decoding of available information above chance level is possible for all participants, both after stimulus presentation, as well as before task response. Starting from stimulus onset, the temporal processing hierarchy of informed vs. uninformed decision-making spans from visual processing through hippocampal memory processes to frontal control network shifting. The anterior insula, known to be a decision-making hub, codes available information during the decision phase prior to button press. These results further elucidate the neural basis of coded information availability and confirm the feasibility of a decision-making BCI.",

      "title": "Multiparametric MRI and imaging transcriptomics reveal molecular and cellular correlates of neurodegeneration in experimental multiple system atrophy",
      "content": "Background: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive -synucleinopathy characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction associated with widespread oligodendroglial -synuclein inclusions, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed characteristic patterns of brain atrophy and microstructural alterations in MSA, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these imaging abnormalities remain poorly understood. The proteolipid protein-human -synuclein (PLP-Syn) transgenic mouse model reproduces key pathological and behavioral features of MSA and provides a valuable platform to dissect the biological substrates of MRI-detected changes and their relevance to disease mechanisms. Methods: We performed the first whole-brain MRI characterization of the PLP-Syn model using ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with imaging alterations, we applied an imaging transcriptomics framework integrating MRI-derived phenotypes with more than 4,000 spatial gene expression maps from the Allen Brain Atlas. Gene ontology and cell-type enrichment analyses identified biological processes and cellular contributors linked to MRI changes, and imaging-correlated genes were compared with differentially expressed genes from cerebellar RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to assess molecular concordance. Results: PLP-Syn mice exhibited widespread brain atrophy involving the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and white matter tracts, closely mirroring neuroimaging findings in patients with MSA. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in major white matter tracts and increased mean diffusivity in the brainstem and cerebellum, reflecting distinct microstructural pathologies. Imaging transcriptomics linked these alterations to genes regulating myelination, gliogenesis, and neuroinflammation, strongly enriched for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte markers, while diffusivity changes were associated with neuronal connectivity and energy metabolism. Imaging-correlated gene signatures showed significant overlap with RNAseq-derived molecular profiles, reinforcing the biological validity of the imaging-derived mechanisms. Conclusions: MRI sensitively detects MSA-like neurodegeneration in the PLP-Syn mouse, providing a translationally relevant platform to investigate the biological basis of imaging biomarkers. Integrating MRI with spatial transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MRI-detected alterations, advancing mechanistic understanding of MRI changes in MSA and establishing imaging transcriptomics as a powerful approach to bridge neuroimaging with molecular pathology in -synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of a de novo C9ORF72 knock-in isogenic iPSC cell bank to model ALS and FTD",
      "content": "Background: The pathogenic G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Studies focused on delineating the underlying perturbed mechanisms resulting from this genetic mutation are often confounded by the heterogeneity present in current disease models, such as patient-derived iPSC lines, with estimations of between 5-46% of the variation in iPSC cell phenotypes resulting from inter-individual differences. Isogenic models, in which the pathogenic mutation is introduced into a defined genetic background, offer a powerful approach to isolating mutation-specific effects and enable high-resolution comparison across distinct ALS/FTD-associated mutations. Such models are essential for uncovering convergent disease mechanisms and improving reproducibility in ALS/FTD research. Methods: A two-step scarless CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy was used to generate isogenic human iPSC lines carrying a de novo knock-in of a disease-length G4C2 repeat expansion in theC9ORF72 locus. The resulting lines underwent thorough quality control and were differentiated into lower motor neurons and assessed for the presence of key ALS/FTD pathologies, including changes to C9ORF72 mRNA and protein expression, RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins. Results: Two C9ORF72 knock-in iPSC lines were generated with 631 and 600 G4C2 repeats, alongside an isogenic genome editing control line. The C9ORF72 G4C2repeat expansion knock-in iPSC lines exhibit both loss-of-function and gain-of-function pathological features characteristic of ALS/FTD. Compared to the parental wild-type KOLF2.1J line and isogenic (wild-type) CRISPR control line, these exhibit a significant reduction in C9ORF72 mRNA and protein levels, the presence of RNA foci accumulation, and a marked increase in poly(GA) and poly(GP) dipeptide repeat protein levels in iPSCs and motor neurons. Conclusions: This is one of the first reports of a successful knock-in of the pathogenic C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansion into a human iPSC line, establishing a genetically defined and physiologically relevant model of ALS/FTD. These isogenic lines recapitulate both key loss- and gain-of-function disease pathologies, providing a crucial complement to existing patient-derived iPSC banks. By eliminating confounding genetic background variability, these cell lines will enable more precise interrogation of C9ORF72-linked pathomechanisms and offer a robust platform for comparative studies across the ALS and FTD spectrum, mechanistic investigations, and future therapeutic targeting with enhanced translational relevance.",

      "title": "Mycophenolate mofetil reduces the branching of microglial processes",
      "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play important roles not only in immune response but also in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural circuit formation. Microglia also surveil the brain environment via elongation and retraction of their processes. Previously, we found that the purine salvage pathway is involved in the regulation of morphology and dynamics of the microglial cell line BV2. Here, we show that intraperitoneal administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, reduces microglial branching during postnatal development. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MMF administration decreases guanosine nucleotides in the brain. Interestingly, despite the essential role of guanosine nucleotides in cellular proliferation, MMF administration did not significantly affect microglial proliferation. On the other hand, MMF administration attenuated the level of GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Rac1 small GTPases. Notably, MMF administration decreased the number of branches, while process length remained unaffected. Since microglial branching affects microglial complexity and diversity, our findings suggest that guanosine nucleotide production is essential for generating proper microglial diversity.",

      "title": "Temporal cueing improves audition with no evidence for attentional tradeoffs",
      "content": "Temporal cues help us focus attention at just the right moment. Whereas visual temporal attention selectively boosts perception at attended times at a cost to other moments, it remains unclear whether auditory temporal attention operates under the same constraints. To address this question, we designed a two-target temporal cueing task where participants discriminated the frequency sweep direction of one of two successive auditory stimuli, separated by 250 ms, while temporal attention was directed to one or both time points. We found that temporal attention improved auditory discrimination only for the first time point and could then remain sustained across the interval, without evidence of attentional tradeoffs across time. Further, manipulating auditory feature uncertainty changed overall performance but did not modulate the impact of temporal attention or yield tradeoffs. Finally, comparison to previous data from a closely matched visual task confirmed that while temporal attention enhanced perception in both vision and audition, only vision shows tradeoffs at this timescale. Altogether the results suggest that the temporal constraints on attention are modality-dependent.",

      "title": "Motor Cortical Output Integrates Distorted Proprioceptive Feedback",
      "content": "Proprioceptive feedback from muscles is essential for continuous monitoring and precise control of limb movement, yet how such peripheral feedback is integrated into ongoing descending motor cortical dynamics remains largely unclear. Here we used precisely timed optogenetic stimulation of forelimb muscles to manipulate proprioceptive signals during a mouse reach-to-consume task. Mice were able to successfully reach and consume despite muscle stimulation-evoked forelimb deviations. Across the cortex, the caudal forelimb area (CFA) was preferentially activated by muscle-specific proprioceptive inputs and contributed to stabilizing perturbed forelimb movement. CFA extratelencephalic (ET) neurons encoded movement kinematics as well as proprioceptive feedback. At neuron population level, proprioceptive perturbations rapidly deflected CFA ET neural trajectories away from the task-relevant manifold yet exerted only limited effects on evolving task dynamics. These results reveal that descending cortical circuit implements activity subspace separation to encode and integrate distorted proprioceptive feedback while preserving task-relevant output.",
