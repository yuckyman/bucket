      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Tracking instances of task evoked oxygen influxes using a novel sensitive BLE enabled wearable fNIRS device identifies mPFC role in spatial memory.",
      "content": "Real-world neuroimaging requires true portability and sensitivity to detect signals from neuronal activity. Conventional methods such as MRI, EEG, or PET are constrained by their size and instrumentation complexity. Near Infra-Red (NIR) based optical methods have the potential for sensitive detection with a smaller footprint. Despite rapid advances in NIR detection there is no known device that is implementable using off-the-shelf integrated microprocessors and possesses the above desired characteristics along with proven sensitivity to detect task evoked responses. Here, we present a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled, high-sensitivity wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for untethered cortical hemodynamic monitoring during naturalistic cognitive tasks. Our fully integrated optical sensing device merges optical data acquisition and wireless transmission into a compact, cable-free platform with a very small footprint. This enables continuous multi-channel recording without placing any constraint on the movement of the subject. We validate our device for reliable detection of task-evoked oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin dynamics in the forearm, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Subsequently, we capture real-time forebrain activity during a screen-based learning and memory task, revealing robust goal-specific hemodynamic responses. We formulate a method to identify the instances of peak neuronal activity and follow the task Evoked Instances of Differential Oxygen influx(tEIDO) as the subject is engaged in a task. These results highlight the potential of our proposed fNIRS device as a mobile neuroimaging solution for next-generation brain-computer interfaces and real-world cognitive monitoring.",

      "title": "Multimodal MRI Insights into Glymphatic Clearance and Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in Healthy Aging",
      "content": "Aging is associated with impaired CSF clearance in preclinical models, but its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) health and glymphatic function in humans remains unclear. We aimed to compare healthy younger and older adults using multimodal MRI to assess age-related changes in BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance, and to examine the relationships between these measures. Thirty participants were recruited (12 younger, 26 {+/-} 3 years; 18 older, 75 {+/-} 7 years). Diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeling measured the water exchange rate (Kw) across the BBB; free water (FW) imaging quantified extracellular free water in white matter; and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) assessed glymphatic function. Older individuals showed reduced whole-brain Kw (p=0.021), increased white matter FW (p=0.002), and reduced DTI-ALPS (p<0.001) compared to younger adults. Kw associated with both DTI-ALPS ({beta}=0.402x10-2, p=0.022) and FW ({beta}=-0.676x10-3, p=0.008). Reduced Kw may reflect impaired BBB function, while reduced DTI-ALPS and increased FW indicate impaired glymphatic clearance. FW partially mediated the relationship between Kw and DTI-ALPS, suggesting a potential mechanistic link. Overall, this study provides novel multimodal MRI insights into BBB and glymphatic alterations in healthy aging and may inform the development of MRI biomarkers to preserve cognitive health.",
