      "title": "Suppressive Genetic Interactions Between Haploinsufficient Mitochondrial Genes Encoded in the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Locus Define Brain and Cardiac Phenotypes",
      "content": "Genomic copy number variations, such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, cause pleiotropic disorders that affect diverse organ systems and disrupt neurodevelopment. Deletions of the 22q11.2 locus reduce the dosage of up to 46 protein coding genes, raising questions about the identity of haploinsufficient genes and their genetic interactions contributing to 22q11.2 phenotypes. Here, we dissect functional and molecular relationships between two genes encoded within the 22q11.2 locus: the mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene MRPL40 and the mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1. We show that a MRPL40 null mutation disrupts mitochondrial translation, impairs respiration, and affects multiple components of the SLC25A1 interactome including factors required for lipid metabolism, mitochondrial ribosome subunits, and the mitochondrial RNA processing machinery. In silico coessentiality network analysis revealed correlated and anticorrelated fitness interactions linking MRPL40 and SLC25A1 to mitochondrial translation, intermediate carbon metabolism, and interferon signaling. We determined that Mrpl40-null mutations are embryonic lethal in mice, but Mrpl40-/+ mice are viable and displayed embryonic cardiac development and adult behavioral phenotypes. Similarly, Slc25a1+/- animals showed embryonic cardiac developmental defects but lacked the adult behavioral phenotypes observed in Mrpl40-/+ mice. Surprisingly, transheterozygotic Slc25a1+/-;Mrpl40-/+ mice suppressed or mitigated cardiac development, behavioral, and brain transcriptome phenotypes observed in single heterozygotic animals. These results reveal that MRPL40 and SLC25A1 are haploinsufficient genes within the 22q11.2 locus that genetically and biochemically interact to define tissue development and physiology. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the complexity and type of gene dosage interactions within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome locus.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Automatic Auditory Regularity Detection Reflect Individual Differences in Explicit Short-Term Memory",
      "content": "Perception is shaped by the statistical structure of the environment, reflecting the brain's capacity to detect and exploit regularities in sensory input. This process requires the maintenance of contextual information over time, yet the nature of the memory mechanism supporting automatic structure learning remains unclear. Here, we ask whether auditory regularity processing relies on a dedicated sensory buffer or instead draws on domain-general mnemonic resources. We related neural indices of regularity processing measured with EEG during passive listening to behavioural performance on an explicit auditory short-term memory task. Human participants (N=30; both sexes) passively listened to regularly repeating (cycles of 5.5 seconds) or random tone sequences, while sustained and tone-locked neural responses were extracted as complementary markers of predictability tracking and prediction-error signalling. Individual differences in explicit memory performance, quantified using a delayed match to sample task, systematically predicted both neural measures: high performers showed enhanced sustained responses and attenuated tone-evoked responses (most pronounced in the N2 time window; 250-400 ms post-onset) to regular sequences, whereas low performers showed no reliable modulation by sequence structure. These findings demonstrate that the memory processes engaged automatically during auditory pattern analysis are not encapsulated, but instead draw on shared mnemonic resources, providing a link between predictive perception and individual variability in sensory memory capacity.",

      "title": "Expectation of aversive outcomes drives multimodal integration of behavioural, physiological and neural activations during human fear retrieval and generalisation",
      "content": "Classical fear conditioning describes how neutral cues acquire a threat value, yet how learned associations are retrieved and generalised across similar stimuli specifically is an ongoing debate. We combined behavioural ratings, physiological measures, and fMRI in a two-day classical fear conditioning paradigm to characterize acquisition, retrieval, and generalisation across modalities. Twenty-five healthy participants completed acquisition trials on Day 1 and retrieval and generalisation trials on Day 2 using conditioned (CS+, CS-) and graded generalisation stimuli (GS). Outcomes included trial-wise US expectancy ratings, pre/post fear and arousal ratings, skin conductance responses (SCR), pupil dilation, and ROI-based fMRI (amygdala, hippocampus, insula, periaqueductal gray (PAG), locus coeruleus). Acquisition yielded robust CS+/CS- discrimination in behavioural ratings and increased BOLD responses in bilateral insula and PAG. During retrieval, US-expectancy ratings indicated early retrieval of CS contingency. The fMRI results showed greater BOLD activity during CS+ presentations than during CS- presentations in bilateral hippocampus, left insula and right PAG. Additionally, hippocampus-insula coupling increased. Critically, parametric modulation during retrieval revealed that trial-wise mean US-expectancy modulated BOLD responses in left insula and right PAG, with a trend in left hippocampus. Across generalisation, US-expectancy and pupil dilation responses followed graded profiles, which could be explained by a Gaussian model, whereas SCR generalised, but was not captured by a Gaussian model. Parametric modulation by US-expectancy correlated with BOLD activity in left PAG, with a trend in right hippocampus. Stimulus identity explained variance in bilateral insula and left PAG. Findings converge on a hippocampus-insula-PAG network that retrieves learned predictions, and scales defensive output according to similarity-based threat probability, linking subjective, physiological, and neural outcomes.",

      "title": "Astrocytes control oxytocin-based maternal behavior via connexin 30",
      "content": "Prosocial and affiliative behaviors rely on complex neuroendocrine neuronal circuits. Dynamic neuroglial interactions play prominent roles in shaping synaptic networks, whose alterations contribute to psychiatric disorders associated with social deficits. However, a role for astrocytes in regulating maternal behavior remains elusive. Here, we show that female mice exhibiting increased oxytocin levels in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus upon social interactions with pups display neuroglial structural plasticity and downregulation of astroglial connexin 30, a protein involved in morphological remodeling. We found that impairing astroglial connexin 30 expression alters the structural properties of astrocytes by decreasing their volume and coverage of oxytocinergic synapses in the supraoptic nucleus of female mice. This functionally sets levels of plasma oxytocin and maternal behavior, exacerbating maternal care in virgin pup-naive female mice deficient for astroglial Cx30. Hypothalamic astrocytes, via connexin 30, are thus key determinants of oxytocin-based maternal behavior, whose alteration is known to impair social skills development in offspring.",

      "content": "Structural and functional insights into the mouse hypothalamus are hampered by its small size and deep location. Here, we leverage ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 17.2 Tesla to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in structural, functional and neurochemical imaging of the mouse hypothalamus, including sexual dimorphism in certain nuclei. High-resolution ex vivo anatomical MRI enabled precise hypothalamic parcellation, improving on existing atlases and revealing nuclei previously unresolved by MRI. Diffusion MRI and tractography mapped intra- and extra-hypothalamic pathways, facilitating circuit-level exploration without a priori assumptions. Resting-state fMRI combined with independent component analysis identified novel hypothalamic networks, demonstrating the enhanced capacity of UHF MRI to detect deep-brain activity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantified neurochemical profiles, revealing sexually dimorphic heterogeneity within the hypothalamus. Our comprehensive multimodal approach uncovers sex differences in hypothalamic anatomy, microstructure, and neurochemistry, emphasizing the importance of sex as a biological variable. This integrated pipeline offers a valuable resource for dissecting hypothalamic circuits and functions, advancing our understanding of neuroendocrine regulation, behavior, and disease mechanisms, with direct translational relevance.",

      "content": "Frame-based fluorescence imaging has long defined how neural activity is optically measured. This approach requires acquiring all pixels within an image, regardless of whether they carry meaningful neural dynamics, thereby intrinsically coupling spatial and temporal resolution while increasing data output. Here, we introduce an entirely different, frame-free approach that leverages the sparse nature of neural activity using event-based cameras, which asynchronously report fluorescence changes as spatiotemporal events. Compared with a frame-based camera, our method preserves signal fidelity while eliminating the fixed trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and data rate, thereby reducing data output by orders of magnitude. Applied to hippocampal preparations we demonstrate that the frame-free approach can resolve both single action potentials and fast network dynamics over large fields of view at kilohertz rates, enabling scalable, ultrafast optical recordings.",

      "title": "Aging Converts Microglial Repopulation into Maladaptive Reprogramming that Exacerbates Cognitive Deficits",
      "content": "Background and Purpose Aging has been associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Microglial repopulation after pharmacological depletion has been proposed as a strategy to alleviate microglia-driven neuropathology. However, the effects of microglial repopulation on age-related cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how microglial repopulation affects the transcriptomic profiles of cortical microglia and the decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Experimental Approach Young and aged male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Microglial depletion was induced by treatment with PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, followed by microglial repopulation after drug withdrawal. Microglia isolated from the entire cerebral cortex were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. The visual discrimination test followed by the response direction test was conducted to assess sensory learning and attentional set shifting abilities, respectively. Key Results Repopulated cortical microglia in aged, but not young, mice exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of microglial identity genes, reprogramming of innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression, and derepression of neuronal gene expression. Furthermore, microglial repopulation selectively impaired visual discrimination learning and attentional set shifting in aged mice. Conclusion and Implications These findings demonstrate that aging converts microglial repopulation into maladaptive reprogramming that exacerbates cognitive decline, possibly through aberrant gene expression programs. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of this approach must be carefully evaluated with respect to specific behavioral domains and disease contexts, including aging.",

      "title": "Aging redirects prior expectations from perception to action",
      "content": "Aging profoundly reshapes how the brain integrates sensory evidence with prior expectations during perceptual decision-making. Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.",

      "title": "MEG correlates of empty subjects in Japanese control and raising constructions",
      "content": "Empty categories are unpronounced elements with syntactic properties that play a central role in theories of sentence structure. Although there are several types within these categories, the neural basis for distinguishing among them remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigate whether the brain distinguishes between two Japanese sentence structures: Control and raising. Although these constructions appear similar on the surface, they are argued to involve different types of empty categories. In theoretical analyses, the control-type empty category, which is called PRO, is often treated as an anaphoric element, similar to reflexives such as himself and herself, whereas the raising-type empty category is a noun phrase trace. Twenty-six native Japanese speakers participated in a reading task under three experimental conditions: Control, raising, and baseline. Source estimates were computed, and condition differences were tested using spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation t-tests. We observed late left-hemispheric differences at approximately 700-800 ms after the critical verb. The control condition elicited larger responses than the raising condition, with activity centered in the temporal cortex spanning the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus and extending into the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the control condition elicited larger late responses than the baseline condition in a broader left fronto-temporal distribution, including the inferior frontal cortex, the anterior temporal cortex, and the insula. These results provide source-level evidence that brain activity in the left language network differs between the control and raising conditions in Japanese during online sentence comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that we can distinguish empty category types in the brain.",
