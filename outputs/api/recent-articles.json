      "title": "Beta bursts mediate amygdala gating of hippocampal emotional encoding",
      "content": "The amygdala and hippocampus are central to emotional processing, yet the transient neural dynamics coordinating these regions remain unclear. We simultaneously recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials from both regions in epilepsy patients during an emotional image-rating task. Neurons in both regions responded to images with firing rate changes that predicted subjective ratings of extreme pleasantness or unpleasantness. To examine the underlying oscillatory mechanisms, we analyzed beta bursts (13-30 Hz)-transient, high-power events-since conventional spectral analyses revealed no valence-specific patterns. Beta bursts were associated with increased gamma amplitude and enhanced phase coherence in both structures, with beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling capturing emotion-related dynamics. Critically, amygdala beta bursts strongly suppressed hippocampal firing through interneuron activation during negative valence processing, whereas hippocampal bursts showed no reciprocal influence. These findings suggest that beta bursts provide a temporal code for emotion and represent a candidate mechanism for targeted neuromodulation in mood disorders.",

      "title": "Local thalamic interneurons drive spindle termination and enable sleep-dependent learning",
      "content": "The thalamus is central to fundamental brain functions including sensation, attention, and sleep through the precise generation and regulation of neuronal ensemble oscillatory activity. Sensory thalamic circuits are considered feedforward structures, lacking lateral connectivity, while recurrence in the network is mediated by interactions with inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Here, we define previously uncharacterized functional roles of local thalamic interneurons, a component of the sensory thalamus whose function has remained unexplored. We demonstrate that local interneuron activation induces rebound oscillations in thalamocortical relay neurons ex vivo and neocortical spindles in vivo, while their inhibition increases spindle occurrence, overall spindle duration and impairs sensory learning. Our findings reveal that local thalamic interneurons have shared and complementary functions to those of thalamic reticular neurons and are required for proper spindle formation and sleep-dependent learning. Together, this work establishes an important neural substrate of thalamocortical circuit function.",

      "title": "Dscam1 Controls Presynaptic Terminal Size to Regulate Synaptic Structure and Function in a Central Motor Circuit",
      "content": "The Drosophila giant fiber system is a well-characterized escape circuit that enables precise investigation of synaptic development and function. Here, we examined the role of the cell adhesion molecule Dscam1 in shaping presynaptic architecture and supporting circuit performance. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dscam1 in giant fiber interneurons, we observed reduced presynaptic terminal volume, smaller synapse interfaces, and reduced levels of electrical (Shak-B) and chemical (Bruchpilot) synaptic proteins. Despite this reduction in overall abundance, protein localization and density remained unchanged. Functionally, Dscam1 knockdown impaired circuit performance, both increasing latency and reducing success at high frequency demand. Correlation and principal component analysis of our data set show that anatomical variables, particularly presynaptic terminal size, best predicted circuit output. These findings identify Dscam1 as a key developmental regulator of presynaptic terminal size, linking early axon terminal elaboration to adult synaptic function in a central motor circuit. More broadly, our results exemplify a volumetric scaling model where available presynaptic area constrains the distribution of synaptic proteins, both electrical and chemical.",

      "content": "Creativity is central to human innovation, yet it often fluctuates from moment to moment. Identifying simple interventions to reliably boost creativity has broad scientific and societal value. Here, we tested whether short-pulse oxygen inhalation enhances creative problem-solving. Sixty participants performed two established tasks: the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), capturing divergent idea generation, and the Fusion Innovation Test (FIT), assessing both divergent and convergent thinking. Oxygen (~40% FiO2) was delivered in 1-minute pulses at 3-4-minute intervals, designed to align with intrinsic brain flexibility rhythms. Responses were scored for novelty, feasibility, and goal attainment using a validated GPT-based method. Linear mixed-effects regression revealed that oxygen significantly enhances both the quality and quantity of creative ideas across tasks. These findings demonstrate that a safe, low-cost physiological intervention can augment creative performance, providing a new link between oxygen metabolism, neural flexibility, and problem-solving.",

      "title": "Depression reduces structurally informed network flexibility in premanifest Huntington's disease",
      "content": "Objective: The extent to which structural connectivity constrains effective connectivity in both depression and neurodegenerative contexts remains poorly understood. In particular, the relationship between structural connectivity aberrations and effective dysconnectivity associated with depression in Huntingtons disease remains uncharacterized. Here, we applied a novel procedure that implements structural connectivity-informed spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine how structural connectivity shapes directed inter-regional influences in premanifest Huntingtons disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) with and without depression history. Method: Using spectral dynamic causal modeling embedded in a hierarchical empirical Bayes framework, we analyzed fMRI data from 98 premanifest HDGECs across default mode network and striatum (caudate and putamen). HDGECs were split into two groups based on either having a history of depression or not, and depression severity on both the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Depression Subscale (HADS-D) was used to measure clinically elevated depression symptoms. Leave-one-out cross-validation was implemented to test predictive validity. Results: Model evidence substantially favored structurally informed over uninformed approaches across all participants. For HDGECs, having a history of depression was associated with reduced baseline variability in effective connectivity (decreased  parameter), with particularly tight regularization of near-zero-valued structural connections toward zero effective connectivity values while leaving strongly connected pathways relatively unaffected. Effects converged on striatal self-connectivity and hippocampal-striatal pathways, with distinct patterns emerging between depression history groups. Notably, clinically elevated depression revealed differential connectivity signatures, with right caudate self-connectivity showing positive correlations with clinical cut-offs for HDGECs with and without depression history. In leave-one-out cross-validation, specific connections including DMN-to-striatum (BDI: r = -0.31, p = .002; HADS-D: r = -0.33, p = .001), right hippocampus-to-left caudate (BDI: r = -0.46, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .002), and left caudate-to-left putamen (BDI: r = -0.48, p < .001; HADS-D: r = -0.30, p = .003) significantly predicted individual differences in depression severity scores. Conclusion : Together, these findings link reduced network flexibility to depression vulnerability in premanifest neurodegeneration, providing a mechanistic bridge between anatomical constraints, effective connectivity alterations, and clinical depression phenotypes.",

      "title": "Eye Drop Instillation Success and Hand Function in Adults with Glaucoma: A Pilot Study",
      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Despite hand function deficits, in this exploratory pilot study, adults with glaucoma demonstrated eye drop instillation success comparable to those without glaucoma, though with higher rates of bottle tip contact with the eye, skin, or eyelashes, suggesting an increased risk of potential eye drop bottle contamination. These findings suggest that though regular practice may help mitigate the effects of hand function deficits on the targeted activity of getting the eye drop in the...",

      "content": "Mammals and reptiles possess a sophisticated somatosensory system for precise tactile discrimination via mechanosensory end-organs, such as Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles and others. These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",
