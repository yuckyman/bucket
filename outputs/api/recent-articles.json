      "title": "Expression of Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the dorsolateral striatum is critical for the temporal coordination of acetylcholine and dopamine, and motor learning.",
      "content": "Neuropeptides are key modulators of adult neurocircuits, balancing their sensitivity to both excitation and inhibition, and fine-tuning fast neurotransmitter action under physiological conditions. We found that the mono-carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can take part in producing and/or processing of several neuroactive peptides in the mammalian brain and is best known for converting the pro-inflammatory peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) to the stress-ameliorating and neuro-protective peptide angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), is broadly expressed in the striatum. Cholinergic interneurons (CIN) of the striatum, known to express multiple peptide receptors also co-expressed the corresponding and functionally opposing receptors angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) for Ang II and mas receptor (MasR) for Ang 1-7 . Accordingly, the conditional, semi acute ablation and/or local pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 increased the frequency of acetylcholine (ACh) bursts, reduced the amplitude of dopamine (DA)-modulated pausing of CIN activity, and disrupted the temporal coordination of extracellular levels of ACh and DA during burst events. Further, ablation of ACE2 in the DLS biased directional movement and impaired motor skill learning. Co-injection of the AT1R inhibitor losartan and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonist quinpirole reduced steady state level cholinergic activity in an additive manner, and proximity ligation supported close spatial association of AT1R and D2R on CINs. Together our study provides evidence that striatal produced ACE2 impinges on the dynamics of ACh and DA and impacts action selection and motor learning through functional and structural interactions of peptidergic and dopaminergic signaling on CIN.",

      "title": "Active Sampling and Sex Differences in Perceptual Decision Making in Rats",
      "content": "Decisions are typically viewed as arising from a sequential process: perception, decision, and then action. However, an alternative perspective, drawing from ecological psychology and embodied cognition, suggests that perception, decision, and action are interconnected in a cycle. Perception is an active process where information is gathered from the environment through actions that sample task stimuli. The sampling behavior of an animal reflects its internal state and serves as inputs that influence the decision-making process. To examine this framework, we trained rats on a visual stimulus detection task with three luminance levels. Our findings indicated that the time rats spent actively sampling the stimuli correlated with their success in detection, regardless of the cue's luminance. Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) showed that cue luminance primarily affected the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), while active sampling specifically influenced the decision threshold. These results suggest that perceptual decisions are reliant on active cue sampling, supporting the notion that actions and decisions are co-regulated. We also identified significant sex differences: female rats spent more time sampling the cues than male rats. Additionally, males took longer to act after making errors, possibly due to less efficient sampling behavior. These performance differences were linked to negative influences of sampling time on drift rates in females, but not in males. This divergence in the relationship between active sampling and DDM parameters is further support for a sex difference in choice impulsivity.",

      "title": "Human-like individual differences emerge from random weight initializations in neural networks",
      "content": "Much of AI research targets the behavior of an average human, a focus that traces to Turing's imitation game. Yet, no two human individuals behave exactly alike. In this study, we show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with different random initializations exhibit substantial individual differences that resemble those in humans. Using a large dataset (N = 60) of human responses (accuracy, confidence, & response time) in a digit recognition task, we trained multiple instances of three ANN architectures on the same task, creating as many ANN instances as human subjects. We found that these ANN instances vary significantly from one another. Critically, ANN instances showed consistent variation in their alignment with specific human subjects. This consistency in alignment between ANN instances and humans extended across behavioral metrics, indicating that an ANN instance mimicking an individual on one metric also does so on others. Finally, we showed that leveraging these alignments improves predictions of individual human responses. Our findings highlight the potential of ANNs to capture human variability, opening new directions to develop models that go beyond aligning the average human and instead aligning the idiosyncratic behavior of specific individuals.",

      "title": "Individual Differences in Training Naive Listeners to Localize Spatial Audio in Virtual Reality",
      "content": "It has been widely believed that a key factor in creating realistic spatial audio in virtual reality (VR) is the head-related transfer function (HRTF), which is unique to each individual, but costly to measure for widespread use. This study investigates the effects of HRTF personalization and training on sound localization accuracy in VR. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 compared naive listeners and those who underwent brief training on localization tasks using personalized versus generic HRTFs; Experiment 2 used a within-subject design to assess training effects over two sessions. Results show that accurately localizing sound can be a difficult task for many participants the first time. Training significantly improves localization accuracy, reducing errors and confusions, and enabling many initially non-sensitive listeners to perceive spatial audio effectively. Although HRTF personalization yielded a statistically significant benefit, the effect was small, primarily improving elevation perception at extreme angles. These findings suggest that generic HRTFs combined with user training may suffice for most VR applications.",

      "title": "Frequency-Dependent Modulation of the Prefrontal Cortex by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound: Impact on Mesolimbic Dopamine Signaling",
      "content": "Synchronized neural oscillations are fundamental for cognitive function and orchestrate inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission and downstream signaling. We hypothesized that low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) with frequency parameters mimicking oscillatory patterns would enable targeted neuromodulation. Building on prior findings of the ability of LIFU to modulate neurotransmission, we investigated the effects of frequency-modulated LIFU applied to the prelimbic cortex (PLC) on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core as well as neuronal and astrocytic activity. After three 80-second LIFU stimulations spaced 30 minutes apart, we found that LIFU excited or inhibited NAcc dopamine release for up to 90 minutes, and these effects were dependent on oscillation frequency and sex. In male rats, theta (8 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) LIFU reduced both dopamine release by 58% and the level of the astrocytic marker GFAP by 50%. Similar decreases in dopamine density were observed in females. Delta (2 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) stimulation produced similar inhibitory effects. Conversely, theta (5 Hz)-coupled gamma (50 Hz) LIFU increased dopamine release by 28% in males. However, similar excitation levels were observed only in females with an increased gamma frequency of 70 Hz (coupled with a theta frequency of 7 Hz). Histological analysis revealed no cell death, but both 8:16 Hz and 5:50 Hz LIFU elevated neuronal activation (cFOS) in the PLC in males, while 5:50 Hz also upregulated GFAP by 30%, suggesting astrocytic involvement. Thus, LIFU stimulation of the PLC can be frequency-tuned to selectively excite or inhibit dopaminergic signaling in the NAcc, suggesting a novel approach for manipulating neurotransmission.",

      "title": "Topological analysis of neuronal assemblies reveals low-rank structure modulated by cholinergic activity",
      "content": "Neuronal assemblies are fundamental building blocks of brain function (e.g. memory, spatial navigation, eye fixation, etc.). However, the principles underlying the connectivity patterns that support their function have remained elusive. The optic tectum of the zebrafish larva is organized into distinct functional neuronal assemblies. These assemblies display all-or-none preferred activation states and inhibitory competition, mechanisms that improve the decoding of visual information. Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy to capture the dynamics of large neuronal networks ([~]2,000 neurons) in the optic tectum; genetic cell-type markers for studying the physiological and functional properties of tectal assemblies; and techniques from topological data analysis to study the dynamic connectivity patterns that enable the emergence and functional role of the neuronal assemblies. We found that during spontaneous activations, tectal assemblies maintain a tight and stable ratio of E-I activity despite the large increase in activity. Topological analysis of the spontaneous activations indicated a low-rank organization of the assemblies and a discrete number of temporal activation patterns. Finally, we observed that the cholinergic system can modulate the topological features of the assemblies to alter their functional role.",

      "title": "Connectivity and phenotype of vasopressin 1a receptor cells in the lateral septum",
      "content": "The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) regulates sexually-differentiated social behaviors, including sexual behavior, aggression, and social communication. Much of AVP's effect on social behavior is mediated by the most widely-expressed AVP receptor in the central nervous system: the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). Dense expression of V1aR is found in males and females in the lateral septum (LS), which also receives heavy input from sexually-differentiated populations of AVP cells in the extended amygdala. In order to access and interrogate the structure and function of V1aR cells, we developed and validated a V1aR-Cre knockin mouse line (Avpr1a-P2A-iCre). V1aR-Cre mice did not differ from their Cre-negative littermates in their health, sensorimotor function, anxiety/motivational behavioral responses, or in their V1aR binding levels in the LS. The distribution of Cre in the brain, as assessed by crosses with Cre-reporter mouse lines and in situ hybridization (ISH), was highly similar to patterns of V1aR binding and demonstrated strong colocalization between Cre and V1aR expression within LS cells. We used this V1aR-Cre mouse to identify the inputs and outputs of V1aR+ cells in the LS, via a monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus as well as anterograde synaptophysin-mRuby AAV tracing approaches. Monosynaptic inputs to V1aR LS cells were observed from the medial preoptic area (MPA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), hippocampus (mostly ventral), medial septum, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Synaptophysin labeling revealed outputs to some of these same structures (MS, LH, DBB, SuM) as well as parts of the lateral preoptic area (LPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and ventral pallidum. Notably, most structures (except for hippocampus) bidirectionally connected to V1aR LS cells also contain populations of V1aR+ cells and are targets for BNST/MeA AVP cells, suggesting an integrated AVP/V1aR circuit. Finally, using ISH, we measured levels of V1aR mRNA expression in subregions of the LS and colocalization of V1aR with oxytocin receptor (OTR) mRNA, which also has a high affinity for AVP, within the LS. We found similar high percentages of cells containing V1aR+ puncta across dorsal and intermediate LS in both males and females. In contrast, the ventral LS contained fewer V1aR+ cells in both males and females. The highest level of co-expression of V1aR and OTR was found in the intermediate LS in both sexes, suggesting the possible location of functional interactions between AVP and oxytocin within the LS. We also sought to identify other phenotypic aspects of V1aR cells using ISH and confirmed that all LS V1aR cells are GABAergic and that most also express corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, suggesting a substrate by which AVP could interact with stress-related systems in the LS. Our characterized V1aR-Cre mouse will be a valuable resource for understanding the role of AVP/V1aR in behavioral and physiological systems. Using this mouse, we have characterized the connectional architecture of V1aR cells in the LS and revealed an interlocking set of structures that may be the substrate through which AVP regulates social and emotional behavior.",

      "title": "The songbird basal ganglia connectome",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) play an essential role in shaping vertebrate behavior, ranging from motor learning to emotions, but comprehensive maps of their canonical synaptic architecture are missing. In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Differential electroencephalography responses in speech perception between native and non-native speakers",
      "content": "IntroductionNative and non-native listeners rely on different neural strategies when processing speech in their respective native and non-native languages, encoding distinct features of speech from acoustic to linguistic content in different ways. This study investigated differences in neural responses between native English and Korean speaker when they passively listened to speech in their native and non-native languages using electroencephalography.MethodsThe study employed two approaches to examine neural responses: Temporal Response Functions (TRFs) measure how the brain tracks continuous speech features (i.e., speech envelope, phoneme onset, phonemic surprisal, and semantic dissimilarity), and Phoneme-Related Potentials (PRPs) assess phonemic-level processes.ResultsNon-native speakers showed significantly stronger neural tracking of the speech envelope, but no group differences for higher-level linguistic features within analyses of TRFs. PRP analyses, however, revealed distinct response patterns across phoneme categories, with non-native speakers showing heightened peaks.ConclusionThe results suggest that non-native speakers rely more on bottom-up acoustic cues during passive listening. TRFs and PRPs provide information on neural markers that indicate how speech is processed differently depending on the listener's native language and language experience.",

      "content": "Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a widespread condition with profound psychological, educational, and occupational consequences. Despite increasing academic attention, few studies have systematically mapped the thematic development of PSA research or anticipated future directions. This study employs a semantically enriched framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with Word2Vec to analyze 990 peer-reviewed journal articles (1995\u20132024) retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning SSCI, SCI-Expanded, ESCI, and A&amp;HCI indices. Nine major thematic clusters are identified, covering topics such as mental health distress, physiological reactivity, language apprehension, social phobia, and virtual reality interventions. Thematic evolution across four historical phases reveals growing conceptual convergence and an increasing focus on digital anxiety and assessment technologies. A Sankey diagram illustrates patterns of thematic continuity and transformation, highlighting both enduring topics and emerging lines of inquiry. To predict future research frontiers, two novelty indicators\u2014Cluster Novelty and Topic Novelty\u2014are introduced. Clusters focused on language learning (Topic 4), virtual therapy (Topic 6), and psychometric tools (Topic 8) emerge as the most temporally novel. This study provides a comprehensive, data-driven mapping of PSA research and offers methodological guidance for future interdisciplinary bibliometric analyses.",

      "content": "IntroductionEmotions play a crucial role in shaping consumer experiences and decisions. Neurophysiological tools offer objective markers of emotional reactions in multisensory environments, where positive valence promotes approach behavior and negative valence fosters avoidance.MethodsWe applied the Osgood semantic differential (SD) to establish correspondences between visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli and target emotions relevant to retail zoning. Based on SD results, we selected stimuli to create multisensory environments. These were presented in immersive virtual reality (VR) to 27 participants. Emotional responses were assessed via heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity (EDA).ResultsSD analysis identified cross-modal associations between sensory stimuli and retail zones, allowing refinement of semantic positioning. VR experiments revealed that HRV significantly increased in pleasant environments, indicating enhanced parasympathetic activation. HR and EDA showed no significant correlation with emotional valence, though both displayed trends toward reduction in pleasant conditions.DiscussionOur findings suggest that HRV is a reliable physiological marker of consumers\u2019 approach behavior in multisensory retail environments, whereas HR and EDA are less sensitive. Combining SD with VR-based neurophysiological assessment enables objective evaluation of emotional zoning strategies, offering a scientifically grounded alternative to intuitive design practices for optimizing consumer experience.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded to assess the neural correlates of MI. Functional outcomes were evaluated using standard assessment tools.ResultsOur results demonstrated significant improvements in motor function across all participants. Additionally, EEG analysis revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the high-alpha band power at motor cortex locations, with individual differences in both the frequency and power of neural activity. However, no significant trends in neural activity were observed across the training sessions.ConclusionThese findings suggest that MI-based BCI training, combined with robotic assistance, offer a promising approach for enhancing upper limb function in ischemic stroke patients.",

      "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",
