      "title": "Relative contribution of gonads and sex chromosomes to sex differences in cell-type gene expression in the mouse medial septum and sex-biased disease risk",
      "content": "Background While sex differences in the brain have traditionally been attributed to gonadal hormones, emerging evidence points to regulation by sex chromosomes. This study aims to differentiate the influence of gonads versus sex chromosomes on cellular gene expression in the mouse medial septum (MS), a critically understudied brain region. Methods Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing and the Sex Chromosome Trisomy mouse model, we (1) quantified sex differences in cellular gene expression and (2) isolated sex-biasing effects by identifying perturbed cell types, differentially expressed genes, biological pathways, and gene networks, which were integrated with GWAS data to explore links with sex-biased human phenotypes. Results Our analysis revealed that volumetric sex differences in the MS are mirrored by widespread transcriptomic changes across cell types. Critically, genetic effects displayed elevated relevance compared to sex hormones in driving sex-biased gene expression. These effects converge to regulate synaptic/neuronal development, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. Sex chromosome-associated DEGs were enriched for various human disorders, suggesting a cellular and mechanistic basis for their sex-biased patterns. Conclusions Our findings challenge the classical gonad-centric views of sexual differentiation, as the MS displays sex-biased transcriptional regulation driven by sex chromosome-associated effects that are highly relevant for human health.",

      "title": "Network Rerouting Under Ayahuasca: Temporally and Hemisphere-Resolved EEG Connectomics",
      "content": "Ayahuasca profoundly alters conscious experience, yet robust, time-resolved EEG markers of its network-level effects remain limited. We combined machine learning with complex-network analysis to quantify how functional connectivity reorganizes across time and hemispheres in resting-state EEG from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including three 5-min sessions: pre-dose (T1), 2 h post-dose (T2), and 4 h post-dose (T3). The cohort consisted of naive ayahuasca users, a population known to exhibit attenuated or more stable acute responses, making the detection of network-level changes particularly challenging. Connectivity was estimated using multiple metrics and sliding windows (10-120 s), and network features were computed and averaged to ensure statistical validity. A representation-selection step identified Spearman correlation and an intermediate temporal scale as optimal, with classification performance peaking at 60-70 s (independent-test AUC and accuracy = 0.93). Linear mixed models revealed a bilateral decrease in eigenvector centrality (weaker hub influence), increased degree heterogeneity in the right hemisphere, and reduced global efficiency in the left. Edge-level analyses localized these effects: Posterior-left connections weakened acutely (lowest at T2), whereas right temporal-central coupling transiently strengthened (highest at T2). Together, these convergent results support a mechanistic summary: as hub-centric shortcuts weaken, communication is increasingly routed through alternative, more distributed and less efficient pathways, with a right-lateralized expression at a later time. Methodologically, the window-optimized, hemisphere-resolved, and edge-validated pipeline extends prior EEG work and highlights temporal scale (approximately 60 s) as a biologically meaningful parameter for detecting psychedelic-induced network reorganization.",

      "title": "Therapeutic modulation of the calpastatin/calpain pathway restores calpain-mediated synaptic proteolysis and preserves motor neurons survival and function in C9orf72 ALS",
      "content": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in the C9orf72 gene is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS, with early neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction being a key pathological feature. Current therapies provide only limited symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for targeted, mechanism-based interventions. Using a C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model (C9-miR) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) motor neurons, we identified significant downregulation of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a calcium-dependent protease family implicated in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that restoring calpastatin function through calpain inhibition with calpeptin or a novel calpastatin-derived peptide ameliorates locomotor deficits and NMJ dysfunction in the C9-miR zebrafish model. These interventions enhance synaptic vesicle turnover and quantal release at the NMJ while improving motor neuron excitability and synaptic integrity in iPSC-derived motor neurons. N-terminomic/TAILS mass spectrometry approaches revealed direct calpain-mediated cleavage of synaptic proteins in motor neurons derived from C9orf72 patients. Proteolysis of key synaptic proteins, such as spectrin, is prevented by calpeptin and calpastatin peptide treatments. Our findings establish the calpastatin/calpain axis as a pivotal regulator of synaptic function in C9orf72-associated ALS and identify it as a promising therapeutic target, offering a novel strategy to restore synaptic transmission and potentially halt disease progression.",

      "content": "Precise reach-to-grasp movements rely on complex cortico-basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, and can be affected by cellular pathway defects. We investigated whether mild Gnptab deficiency, affecting mannose-6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting, impairs fine motor behaviors in mice. Using the staircase test, high-frame-rate video, and markerless tracking, we assessed reaching and grasping in Gnptab-mutant and control littermates. Our data suggest that Gnptab-mutant mice retrieved about 75% fewer pellets than controls and exhibited abnormal grasping, characterized by increased wrist extension and larger digit angles, decreased digital velocity, and shorter reach distances, while elbow angles remained largely unchanged. These findings suggest a specific deficit in grasp shaping and trajectory control, rather than overall limb positioning. Our data establishes a quantitative link between GNPTAB-related lysosomal pathway disruption and fine-motor impairments, providing a valuable model for understanding how cellular dysfunction impacts motor circuit function.",

      "title": "The Research Landscape of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Parkinson's Disease: Systematic Review and Interactive Tool",
      "content": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has emerged as a powerful framework for characterizing the time-varying network disruptions underlying Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the rapid expansion of this field has introduced substantial methodological heterogeneity, creating a fragmented landscape that complicates knowledge synthesis and clinical translation. To address this, we performed a systematic review to map the conceptual and methodological diversity of dFC research in PD. Beyond a traditional static synthesis, we developed DynaPD, an open-source interactive application that allows researchers to dynamically explore study designs, analytical pipelines, and reported findings. Our synthesis of 37 eligible studies reveals a landscape defined by methodological contrast. While preprocessing strategies exhibited high variability (divergence), we observed a marked convergence on core analytical choices, specifically the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for parcellation and the sliding-window technique coupled with k-means clustering for state identification. Regarding empirical findings, a consensus emerged on the relevance of specific dynamic features - namely dwell time, fraction time, and number of transitions - yet clinical interpretations varied, particularly concerning the implications of strongly connected versus sparsely connected states. We further identified stated limitations across the studies, including a predominance of cross-sectional designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting standards. These findings highlight the urgent need for longitudinal studies with extended acquisition protocols and standardized reporting frameworks. By providing both a systematic evidence synthesis and a living interactive tool, this work aims to consolidate the diverse dFC literature, fostering a more coherent and cumulative path toward precision neurology in PD.",

      "title": "Analytical meditation improves physiological well-being in expert practitioners: a study on central and peripheral neurophysiological correlates",
      "content": "Meditation has been long associated with improvements in mental well-being, emotional regulation, and attentional control. Yet, the diversity of meditative techniques and participant expertise has hindered the systematic identification of their neurophysiological correlates supporting these benefits. To address this challenge, we investigated the neurophysiological signatures of concentrative and analytical meditation in 35 experienced Tibetan monk practitioners. EEG, ECG, EDA, and respiration were simultaneously recorded during Concentrative, Loving-Kindness and Emptiness meditations. Linear-mixed-models revealed significant modulations in autonomic and cortical activity across meditations. Peripheral indices indicated enhanced parasympathetic tone, decreases respiratory rate, and gradual increase in EDA - reflecting a state of relaxed-alertness with concurrent vagal engagement and sustained sympathetic arousal. EEG analyses supported this state showing elevated gamma-band power during analytical meditations. These findings suggest that advanced meditative states foster an adaptive integration of autonomic and cortical responses, supporting the emergence of relaxed-vigilance - a psychophysiological condition associated with well-being and cognitive flexibility.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Disentangling motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations and their modulation with rTMS",
      "content": "Cortical beta oscillations are central to motor control. These rhythms are modulated during movement preparation and execution, and are also sensitive to cognitive factors such as uncertainty, attention and reward prediction. However, the distinct motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations-roles that may inform condition-specific therapeutic strategies-remain unclear. This study aimed to disentangle the respective contributions of motor and cognitive functions, and to assess their modulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twenty-four healthy participants performed a visually cued reaching task in which directional uncertainty was dynamically manipulated by varying the number of targets in real-time. Reaction time was quantified as a behavioural measure. Three stimulation conditions were applied during the preparatory periods between the 'uncertainty' and 'go' cues: no stimulation, regular rTMS at each participant's individual beta frequency, and irregular rTMS. Electroencephalography was used to measure beta-band oscillatory activity. Our results showed that 'uncertainty' cues induced bilateral beta suppression, with greater uncertainty linked to smaller reductions in beta power. Movement-related beta modulation was lateralised to the hemisphere contralateral to the executing hand, where elevated beta power in the pre-'go' cue period predicted longer reaction times. Both regular and irregular rTMS significantly shortened reaction times and attenuated beta event-related desynchronisation. Reductions in beta desynchronisation correlated with improvements in reaction times, suggesting beta desynchronisation reflects a neural threshold for movement initiation. These findings indicate that cortical beta oscillations encode distinct motor and cognitive processes, and that beta frequency rTMS can modulate beta dynamics to facilitate faster movement initiation by lowering this neural threshold.",

      "title": "Drosophila maintain a consistent navigational goal angle for days to weeks",
      "content": "Past work has demonstrated that Drosophila can keep to a consistent navigational bearing for minutes to hours. Here, we ask whether they can do so over days to weeks. First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks. Furthermore, the technology introduced here may enable trained behaviors across thousands of reinforcement trials in Drosophila, a paradigm central to mammalian neuroscience yet absent in flies.",
