      "title": "Multilevel sex-specific neurobiological signatures of early life adversity",
      "content": "Stress exposure early in life is an established risk factor for adult psychiatric illness, yet these disorders -- including anxiety disorders and depression -- show significant sex-dependence in prevalence, symptomatology, and treatment response. The biology underlying these differences remains largely unexplored and may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity in anxiety and depression. Here, we characterize the lasting impact of developmental stress on adulthood neurobiology and behavior in mice by combining analyses of multiple levels of brain function, including whole-brain c-Fos mapping, manganese-enhanced MRI and transcriptomics with advanced behavioral phenotyping. Across levels of investigation, we find distinct and often opposite effects of developmental stress depending on sex. These results together showcase the strong influence of sex on how early life adversity affects the onset of stress-related disorders. This work emphasizes the necessity of considering sex when investigating developmental and neurobiological underpinnings of stress-related disorders and displays a vast range of lasting effects of developmental stress on the brain, which provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to improve psychiatric treatments.",

      "title": "Inhibition of Slc17a7 expressing neurons in the basolateral amygdala which project to the nucleus accumbens shapes the fidelity of motivated behavior",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to form predictive associations between environmental cues and biologically relevant outcomes. Classical models posit that projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promote reward seeking, whereas projections to the central amygdala facilitate defensive responding. However, accumulating evidence indicates that molecular identity and inhibitory dynamics introduce additional layers of functional heterogeneity within these pathways. Genetically defined subsets of BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons can drive either reward-related or aversive behaviors, and single-cell imaging studies show that cue-responsive BLA ensembles undergo an inhibitory shift as conditioning progresses. How these molecular and inhibitory mechanisms interact within defined projections to shape motivated behavior remains unclear. To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that reward conditioning increases inhibitory synaptic input onto Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons and reduces intrinsic excitability. Using a dual-recombinase chemogenetic strategy, we found that selective inhibition of this projection enhances acquisition of a cued reward task, increases instrumental reward seeking, and elevates reward valuation in a two-choice preference assay. Similar enhancement was observed in a fear-discrimination task, where inhibition of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons improved differentiation between threat- and safety-associated cues. These findings identify inhibitory regulation of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons as a key mechanism that strengthens stimulus-outcome associations. By demonstrating that conditioning-associated inhibitory plasticity modulates this major BLA output pathway, the work refines prevailing models of BLA[-&gt;]NAc function and highlights inhibition as an important contributor to the fidelity of motivated behavior.To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway.

      "title": "A pathogenic AMPA receptor gating mutation disrupts synapse-mitochondrion axis and stalls synapse maturation",
      "content": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are central regulators of excitatory synaptic transmission and play critical roles in activity dependent synapse maturation and circuit development. De novo missense mutations in AMPAR subunits have been widely linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Despite this, how these variants lead to neuronal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the consequences of a recurrent pathogenic mutation in the GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T), which alters AMPAR gating properties and is associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We developed a GluA1A636T knock-in mouse model, we show that GluA1A636T mice exhibit impairments in hippocampal dependent learning and working memory accompanied by reduced baseline activity of CA1 neurons in vivo. Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomic analyses of juvenile and adult hippocampal samples revealed that the A636T mutation significantly alters synaptic protein expression at both ages. Notably, the mutation drives a robust upregulation of mitochondrial proteins specifically in adult mice. Consistent with this, dendritic mitochondria in adult GluA1A636T mice exhibited altered morphology and increased oxidative stress. Electrophysiological analyses further revealed abnormalities in synaptic function, including reduced basal excitatory transmission, persistence of functionally silent synapses in adulthood, and altered synaptic plasticity consistent with impaired synapse maturation. Together, these findings demonstrate that a pathogenic AMPAR gating mutation disrupts the coordinated development of synaptic and metabolic programs in the hippocampus, linking altered excitatory signaling to delayed mitochondrial stress and enduring circuit dysfunction. Our study provides a developmental framework for understanding how disease-associated AMPAR variants impair brain function and highlights synapse mitochondria coupling as a critical axis in glutamate receptor ionotropic (GRI) disorders.",

      "title": "Reconciling contradictory models of subthalamic nucleus contributions to basal ganglia beta oscillations",
      "content": "Recent computational studies of Parkinsons disease have yielded contradictory findings regarding the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in pathological beta oscillations, with some models implicating STN as essential for beta generation and others suggesting that STN suppresses oscillations. This work addresses these discrepancies by systematically investigating how the specific features of the integrate-and-fire neurons used in these models influence simulated basal ganglia network dynamics. Using both rate models and spiking network simulations incorporating coupled subthalamopallidal and pallidostriatal circuits, we demonstrate that the choice between leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) models to represent STN neurons fundamentally impacts the phase relationship between STN and external globus pallidus prototypical (Proto) neuron populations. QIF STN neurons establish in-phase coupling with Proto neurons, which enhances beta oscillation amplitude, while LIF STN neurons develop anti-phase relationships, which suppresses beta power. Through intervention experiments and parameter sweeps across physiologically relevant firing rates, we show that these phase-related effects persist robustly across network conditions, and we mathematically establish conditions under which these results are guaranteed to hold. Our findings reveal that the fundamental mathematical structure underlying spike generation, rather than other biophysical details, determines whether the subthalamopallidal loop acts as a beta amplifier or suppressor. This mechanistic insight reconciles contradictory findings in the literature, demonstrates that seemingly minor modeling choices can have profound consequences for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and offers predictions for determining which model framework reflects the biological reality.",

      "title": "Neural modes in motor cortex cycle over fast timescales",
      "content": "The embedding of low-dimensional latent states in the activity of large neuron populations has become a tenet of systems neuroscience. Despite the stability of these latent representations over time, the underlying activity of individual neurons is known to change both within experimental sessions and across days; yet, less attention has been devoted to changes in the coordinated activity of neuron populations on short timescales, particularly under conditions where networks must adapt quickly (e.g., during learning or after injury). To investigate, patterns of individual neuron contributions to population state dimensions in motor cortex were tracked over short blocks of repeated reaching trials. The number of distinct encoding patterns was consistently less than the typical dimensionality reported for motor cortex. Although the neuron population state space and dynamics were effectively conserved, these underlying encoding patterns changed in two ways: fast switches among themselves, as well as slow modifications over time. To explore whether these two drift timescales shared a common physiological mechanism, we analyzed the response of motor cortex to a causal perturbation. Direct electrical current was passed through two recording electrodes to terminate a small number of neurons, which evoked drift over both fast and slow timescales, both together and independently. While changes in fast switch rates were not necessarily associated with behavioral deficits, a significant increase in slow drift was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance. Together, these results reveal an additional timescale of drift in correlated population activity that could help guide the discovery of cellular and network mechanisms responsible for the maintenance, (re)learning, and recovery of low-dimensional structure in neuron populations.",

      "title": "The curse of dimensionality in motor cortex",
      "content": "Understanding how motor cortex generates movement is a foundational challenge in neuroscience. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are widely used to transform high-dimensional neural data into a more interpretable, low-dimensional space. It is broadly assumed that the dimensionality of a particular motor task--that is, the number of principal components needed to explain a fixed fraction of variance--is an intrinsic property of the underlying neural dynamics, potentially modulated by task complexity. Here, we show that unsupervised estimates of dimensionality do not converge but instead scale with the number of recorded neurons. Across four animals, we found that while low-dimensional structure reflects changes in behavioral context, traditional metrics of dimensionality are relatively insensitive to increasingly complex movements. Rather, dimensionality increases with electrode count, exhibiting non-saturating growth as recordings scale to 1000 electrodes. While decoders trained on unsupervised subspaces showed only modest gains with scale, supervised methods leveraged additional electrodes to separate neural states more effectively. Surprisingly, the percentage of variance required for accurate supervised reach decoding became vanishingly small at high electrode counts (<0.1% at 1000 electrodes). Our results challenge current views on cortical dimensionality and highlight the divergent properties of supervised versus unsupervised learning, motivating careful consideration of appropriate computational methods as experimental data volumes scale.",

      "title": "Comprehensive 3D mapping reveals distinct spatial gradients of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen",
      "content": "In addition to spatially organized excitatory forebrain inputs along its mediolateral, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes, the striatum relies on cellular diversity to subserve its myriad processing functions. Distinct striatal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interneurons likely subserve complementary computational roles. However, a detailed understanding of how these microcircuit components are distributed across striatal territories remains lacking. To address this gap, we generated a comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen using genetic labeling, brain-wide imaging, and voxel-wise quantification. We found that SST and TH interneurons were relatively enriched in the ventral caudoputamen, whereas PV interneurons were enriched dorsally. In addition, PV and TH interneurons exhibited opposing anteroposterior distribution patterns, with PV interneurons enriched posteriorly and TH interneurons showing a marked decline in density towards the striatal tail. Consequently, while the three interneuron subtypes displayed comparable densities in the functionally defined lateral striatum and anterior ventromedial striatum, PV interneurons predominated in the dorsomedial striatum and tail of striatum. We did not observe major sex differences. Together, these findings reinforce the view that the striatum is not a monolithic structure: in addition to structured excitatory inputs, inhibitory microcircuits themselves are differentially distributed across striatal territories, providing region-specific constraints on circuit computation. By integrating interneuron organization into existing anatomical frameworks, this atlas provides a foundation for linking striatal anatomy to function across behavioral domains.",

      "title": "Persistent cerebellar molecular layer interneuron activity facilitates anticipatory control of tongue movements",
      "content": "Precise, anticipatory movements depend on the brain ability to generate motor commands in advance of immediate sensory input. Although the cerebellar cortex receives abundant sensory input via the mossy fiber pathway, the mechanisms by which continuous sensory signals are transformed or gated remain poorly understood. Here we show that molecular layer interneurons acquire persistent sensory-related activity in mice that develop anticipatory behavior. Employing a targeted lick interception task, we found that interneurons in lobule Crus I exhibit enhanced activity up to five seconds before movement onset locked to the spatial position of a continuously moving target independent of body movement. In more anticipatory mice, movement onset becomes linked to the dynamics of this persistent activity, whereas less anticipatory mice adjust their movements based on immediate sensory related input. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Crus I, but not Crus II, impairs behavioral performance and delays lick onset without altering overall lick parameters. Our results indicate that anticipation in dynamic sensorimotor tasks relies on sensory representations encoded by interneurons.",

      "title": "An entropic explanation of insistence on sameness in autism",
      "content": "PurposeAn information theory-based framework is proposed in attempt to explain insistence on sameness in autism as an instance of a general behavior pattern in which an individual tries to reduce surprise and uncertainty. It offers a new definition of autism as an impairment in which cognitive functions are restricted to discrimination, memorization and prediction of tangible properties of the environment.MethodsAn analogy between insistence on sameness and constrained minimization of the entropy metric is observed and examined for a set of assumptions that describe cognitive limitations of a person with autism. The metric is given by the formula DH(R, M) = H(R|M)+H(M|R), where R represents sequences of random stimuli, M is a memory that stores and retrieves them, and where H(\u00b7|\u00b7) denotes their conditional entropies interpreted as surprise and uncertainty, respectively.ResultsIt is first inferred that to minimize the metric an individual can learn about R (and store that knowledge in M) or can restrict R to the already known M. Then, it is concluded that insistence on sameness is a manifestation of the latter. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework: (1) Helps to quantify the concepts of surprise, uncertainty, sensory overload and deprivation, anxiety, comfort zone, disappointment, disorientation, pedantry, rigidness, observance or aberrant precision. (2) Leads to a list of guidelines for learning therapies and daily care routines, and allows them to be defined as optimization algorithms and implemented as programs for robotic live-in caregivers. (3) Can be validated with the help of a Turing test-like approach that requires no experiments involving individuals with autism.ConclusionThe framework\u2014if positively validated\u2014will provide advantages of both theoretical and practical importance: it explains the insistent on sameness as a consequence of cognitive restrictions and offers formal foundations and design guidelines for therapies aimed at improving self-reliance of individuals with autism in basic activities of daily living.",
