      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "content": "Chronic brain sensing devices, such as the Medtronic Percept\u2122 or Neuropace RNS system, record local field potentials (LFPs) that may be vulnerable to interference and noise due to hardware limitations, environmental factors, movement, stimulation, cardiac signals, and analytical procedures. Although onboard hardware filters can attenuate some unwanted signals, additional processing is often required. Here we demonstrate that cardiac artifacts significantly alter the power spectral density (PSD) of neural activity within the theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201312 Hz), and beta (12\u201330 Hz) bands. We introduce a time-domain template subtraction method specifically designed to remove QRS complex cardiac artifacts. Separately, we describe techniques for transforming time domain data to the frequency domain and mitigating transient artifacts by estimating background neural activity\u2014either through window rejection based on PSD characteristics or via principal component analysis. Finally, we present an approach to isolate oscillatory neural activity by subtracting the aperiodic 1/f component from the power spectrum by fitting the fitting oscillations and one over F logarithmic function. While filter selection must be tailored to the specific device and participant environment to avoid over-filtering, these interference and noise mitigation strategies are crucial for ensuring the integrity of LFP recordings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.16616v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network, be it at small scale made of cells, mostly neurons, or at larger scale made of neuronal assemblies. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest attempt to walk in the footsteps of classical thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator in physics, or the cogito in philosophy.",

      "title": "Real-time functional connectivity-based neurofeedback of the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during threat-exposure attenuates anxiety",
      "content": "Background: Adaptive regulation of negative emotion is vital for mental health and dysregulations in this domain contribute to the major mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. On the neural level, efficient emotion regulation has been linked to functional communication between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the amygdala. Gaining voluntary control over this pathway may present an effective strategy for potentiating emotion regulation. Objective: Against this background, we developed a novel connectivity-based real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) training that enables individuals to gain volitional control over the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during exposure to threatening stimuli. Methods: The study employed a pre-registered, randomized, sham-controlled design with the experimental group (n = 22) receiving real-time NF information on connectivity between the right DLPFC and the amygdala during threat exposure and the sham control group (n = 23) receiving connectivity NF from a circuit not related to emotion regulation. The ability to maintain regulatory control in the absence of feedback was assessed after four NF runs. Primary outcomes included functional connectivity of the target pathway, as well as anxiety scores. Results: The results demonstrate that successful acquisition of self-regulation of the rDLPFC-amygdala top-down regulatory circuit in the experimental NF group facilitated attenuation of anxiety. Conclusion: In summary, our findings suggest that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows to volitionally enhance rDLPFC-amygdala connectivity, and in turn reduces negative emotional states, rendering the training a promising neurotechnology intervention for mental disorders.",

      "title": "Juvenile reinstatement of TCF4 in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome model mice reveals a critical window for genetic intervention",
      "content": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 which encodes transcription factor 4. As PTHS therapeutics advance toward clinical trials, identifying the optimal timing for treatment is crucial. Our previous research demonstrated that restoring TCF4 during embryonic or neonatal stages, corresponding to prenatal or neonatal periods in humans, improved phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model (Kim et al., 2022). However, PTHS diagnosis generally occurs much later, when infants fail to reach developmental milestones and undergo genetic testing. This raises an essential question: can genetic therapeutics initiated at more clinically relevant time points retain effectiveness? Here, we examined whether reinstating TCF4 in juvenile PTHS model mice could reverse behavioral phenotypes, simulating a gene therapy. Our findings indicate that this delayed intervention largely fails to correct most phenotypes, except for a measure of cognitive function. These results reveal phenotype-specific plasticity and underscore a narrow, early critical window for effective treatment in PTHS. Our study also identifies the hippocampus as a potential target for PTHS therapeutics and suggests that while some cognitive functions may still retain therapeutic plasticity, reversing most core PTHS symptoms may require intervention during the very early postnatal, or potentially prenatal periods, in humans.",

      "title": "In vivo human embryonic spinal cord atlas validates stem cell-derived human dorsal interneurons and reveals ASD spinal signatures",
      "content": "Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in the loss of motor and sensory function. We are working towards restoring sensation by developing directed differentiation protocols to generate dorsal spinal interneurons (dIs; dI1-dI6) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we present an improved method that produces human dIs via a neuromesodermal progenitor state, the physiological intermediate for spinal cord development. We show that retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 11 direct dI identity, while GDF11 and extended time in culture promotes posterior spinal identities. Together, these protocols generate the full complement of dorsal subtypes along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord. To benchmark in vitro-derived dIs, we constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas of the human embryonic spinal cord and used it to show that hESC-derived dIs closely match their endogenous counterparts. The atlas also reveals that the dI4/dI5 populations dramatically expand in comparison with the other spinal lineages. Moreover, they have mechanosensory circuit signatures linked to autism spectrum disorder, implicating spinal circuits in autistic phenotypes.",
