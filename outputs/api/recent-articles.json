      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04108v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: High-stakes decision domains are increasingly exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks. However, LLM deployment in real-world settings presents challenges in data security, evaluation of its capabilities outside controlled environments, and accountability attribution in the event of adversarial decisions. This paper proposes a framework for responsible deployment of LLM-based decision-support systems through active human involvement. It integrates interactive collaboration between human experts and developers through multiple iterations at the pre-deployment stage to assess the uncertain samples and judge the stability of the explanation provided by post-hoc XAI techniques. Local LLM deployment within organizations and decentralized technologies, such as Blockchain and IPFS, are proposed to create immutable records of LLM activities for automated auditing to enhance security and trace back accountability. It was tested on Bert-large-uncased, Mistral, and LLaMA 2 and 3 models to assess the capability to support responsible financial decisions on business lending.",

In this paper, we present TEACH-AI (Trustworthy and Effective AI Classroom Heuristics), a domain-independent, pedagogically grounded, and stakeholder-aligned framework with measurable indicators and a practical toolkit for guiding the design, development, and evaluation of generative AI systems in educational contexts. Built on an extensive literature review and synthesis, the ten-component assessment framework and toolkit checklist provide a foundation for scalable, value-aligned AI evaluation in education. TEACH-AI rethinks \"evaluation\" through sociotechnical, educational, theoretical, and applied lenses, engaging designers, developers, researchers, and policymakers across AI and education. Our work invites the community to reconsider what constructs \"effective\" AI in education and to design model evaluation approaches that promote co-creation, inclusivity, and long-term human, social, and educational impact.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04105v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Access to justice remains a global challenge, with many citizens still finding it difficult to seek help from the justice system when facing legal issues. Although the internet provides abundant legal information and services, navigating complex websites, understanding legal terminology, and filling out procedural forms continue to pose barriers to accessing justice. This paper introduces the LegalWebAgent framework that employs a web agent powered by multimodal large language models to bridge the gap in access to justice for ordinary citizens. The framework combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with multimodal perception, enabling a complete process from user query to concrete action. It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Qu\\'ebec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations. Evaluation results show LegalWebAgent achieved a peak success rate of 86.7%, with an average of 84.4% across all tested models, demonstrating high autonomy in complex real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04087v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.05067v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Web accessibility guidelines require sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds; yet, manually adjusting colors often necessitates significant visual deviation, compromising vital brand aesthetics. We present a novel, multi-phase optimization approach for automatically generating WCAG-compliant colors while minimizing perceptual change to original design choices.\n  Our method treats this as a constrained, non-linear optimization problem, utilizing the modern perceptually uniform OKLCH color space. Crucially, the optimization is constrained to preserve the original hue ($\\text{H}$) of the color, ensuring that modifications are strictly limited to necessary adjustments in lightness ($\\text{L}$) and chroma ($\\text{C}$). This is achieved through a three-phase sequence: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation.\n  Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs demonstrates that the algorithm successfully resolves accessibility violations in $77.22\\%$ of cases, with $88.51\\%$ of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference ($\\Delta E_{2000} < 2.0$) as defined by standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is only $0.76\\ \\Delta E_{2000}$, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of $0.876\\text{ms}$ per color pair.\n  The approach demonstrates that accessibility compliance and visual design integrity can be achieved simultaneously through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization that respects brand identity. The algorithm is publicly implemented in the open-source cm-colors Python library.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04843v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.",

      "title": "Interactive Communication - cross-disciplinary perspectives from psychology, acoustics, and media technology",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.04692v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interactive communication (IC), i.e., the reciprocal exchange of in- formation between two or more interactive partners, is a fundamental part of human nature. As such, it has been studied across multiple scientific disciplines with different goals and methods. This article pro- vides a cross-disciplinary primer on contemporary IC that integrates psy- chological mechanisms with acoustic and media-technological constraints across theory, measurement, and applications. First, we outline theoreti- cal frameworks that account for verbal, nonverbal and multimodal aspects of IC, including distinctions between face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. Second, we summarize key methodological approaches, including behavioral, cognitive, and experiential measures of communica- tive synchrony and acoustic signal quality. Third, we discuss selected applications, i.e. assistive listening technologies, conversational agents, alongside ethical considerations. Taken together, this review highlights how human capacities and technical systems jointly shape IC, consolidat- ing concepts, findings, and challenges that have often been discussed in separate lines of research.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04398v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: What is after presence? Spatial presence, the sense of \"being there\", is becoming less of a primary objective and more of a baseline expectation of virtual reality. More than six decades after its invention, VR is shifting from a technical system into a cultural, social, and phenomenological medium, offering experiences that function as distinct modes of reality. Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience. This shift from presence to experience orchestration invites creators across disciplines to contribute to the design and assessment of meaningful immersive worlds.",

      "title": "Human-controllable AI: Meaningful Human Control",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.04334v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Developing human-controllable artificial intelligence (AI) and achieving meaningful human control (MHC) has become a vital principle to address these challenges, ensuring ethical alignment and effective governance in AI. MHC is also a critical focus in human-centered AI (HCAI) research and application. This chapter systematically examines MHC in AI, articulating its foundational principles and future trajectory. MHC is not simply the right to operate, but the unity of human understanding, intervention, and the traceablity of responsibility in AI decision-making, which requires technological design, AI governance, and humans to play a role together. MHC ensures AI autonomy serves humans without constraining technological progress. The mode of human control needs to match the levels of technology, and human supervision should balance the trust and doubt of AI. For future AI systems, MHC mandates human controllability as a prerequisite, requiring: (1) technical architectures with embedded mechanisms for human control; (2) human-AI interactions optimized for better access to human understanding; and (3) the evolution of AI systems harmonizing intelligence and human controllability. Governance must prioritize HCAI strategies: policies balancing innovation and risk mitigation, human-centered participatory frameworks transcending technical elite dominance, and global promotion of MHC as a universal governance paradigm to safeguard HCAI development. Looking ahead, there is a need to strengthen interdisciplinary research on the controllability of AI systems, enhance ethical and legal awareness among stakeholders, moving beyond simplistic technology design perspectives, focus on the knowledge construction, complexity interpretation, and influencing factors surrounding human control. By fostering MHC, the development of human-controllable AI can be further advanced, delivering HCAI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.04316v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Web privacy is experienced via two public artifacts: site utterances in policy texts, and the actions users are required to take during consent interfaces. In the extensive cross-section audits we've studied, there is a lack of longitudinal data detailing how these artifacts are changing together, and if interfaces are actually doing what they promise in policy. ConsentDiff provides that longitudinal view. We build a reproducible pipeline that snapshots sites every month, semantically aligns policy clauses to track clause-level churn, and classifies consent-UI patterns by pulling together DOM signals with cues provided by screenshots. We introduce a novel weighted claim-UI alignment score, connecting common policy claims to observable predicates, and enabling comparisons over time, regions, and verticals. Our measurements suggest continued policy churn, systematic changes to eliminate a higher-friction banner design, and significantly higher alignment where rejecting is visible and lower friction.",

      "title": "BrainPath: A Biologically-Informed AI Framework for Individualized Aging Brain Generation",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.16667v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The global population is aging rapidly, and aging is a major risk factor for various diseases. It is an important task to predict how each individual's brain will age, as the brain supports many human functions. This capability can greatly facilitate healthcare automation by enabling personalized, proactive intervention and efficient healthcare resource allocation. However, this task is extremely challenging because of the brain's complex 3D anatomy. While there have been successes in natural image generation and brain MRI synthesis, existing methods fall short in generating individualized, anatomically faithful aging brain trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPath, a novel AI model that, given a single structural MRI of an individual, generates synthetic longitudinal MRIs that represent that individual's expected brain anatomy as they age. BrainPath introduces three architectural innovations: an age-aware encoder with biologically grounded supervision, a differential age conditioned decoder for anatomically faithful MRI synthesis, and a swap-learning strategy that implicitly separates stable subject-specific anatomy from aging effects. We further design biologically informed loss functions, including an age calibration loss and an age and structural perceptual loss, to complement the conventional reconstruction loss. This enables the model to capture subtle, temporally meaningful anatomical changes associated with aging. We apply BrainPath to two of the largest public aging datasets and conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted evaluation. Our results demonstrate BrainPath's superior performance in generation accuracy, anatomical fidelity, and cross-dataset generalizability, outperforming competing methods.",

      "content": "arXiv:2412.00008v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: On broadly Copernican grounds, we are entitled to assume that apparently behaviorally sophisticated extraterrestrial entities (\"aliens\") would be conscious. Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly lucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated entities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness (\"consciousness mimics\"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Our approach is unusual in the following respect: Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in a particular metaphysical or scientific theory about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, we appeal directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation.",
