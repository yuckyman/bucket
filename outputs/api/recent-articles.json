      "title": "A neural circuit for female-specific defensive homeostasis in risk assessment",
      "content": "Risk assessment in defensive behavior is an adaptive mechanism shaped by natural selection, enabling individuals to evaluate potential threats and thereby maintain defensive homeostasis. Although risk assessment is essential for survival, it remains unknown whether specific neural circuits maintain their behavioral homeostasis in a sex-specific manner. Here, we show that visual survival threats activated cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R)-expressing neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), initiating consistent risk assessment in both sexes. Deletion of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons female-specifically impairs risk assessment by disinhibiting GABA release in SC-lateral habenula (LHb) projections, resulting in abnormally shortened risk assessment. Furthermore, loss of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons increases the occurrence of abnormal spontaneous behavior following chronic stress exclusively in females. Our findings revealed a female-specific CB1R-modulated SC-LHb GABAergic circuit crucial for maintaining defensive homeostasis in risk assessment, highlighting how disruptions in this circuit underlie deficits in risk assessment and adaptive stress coping.",

      "title": "Prolonged oscillating kisspeptin neuron activity underlies the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in mice",
      "content": "The population of kisspeptin neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is thought to have a key role in generating the GnRH surge that triggers ovulation. Using a modified GCaMP fibre photometry procedure, we have been able to record the in vivo population activity of RP3VKISS neurons across the estrous cycle of female mice. A marked increase in GCaMP activity was detected beginning on the afternoon of proestrus that lasted in total for 13{+/-}1 hours. This was comprised of slow baseline oscillations with a period of 91{+/-}4 min and associated with high frequency rapid transients. Very little oscillating baseline or transient activity was detected at other stages of the estrous cycle. Concurrent blood sampling showed that the peak of the LH surge occurred 3.5{+/-}1.1 h after the first baseline RP3VKISS neuron baseline oscillation on the afternoon of proestrus. The time of onset of RP3VKISS neuron oscillations varied between mice and across subsequent proestrous stages in the same mice. To assess the impact of estradiol on RP3VKISS neuron activity, mice were ovariectomized and given an incremental estradiol replacement regimen. Minimal patterned GCaMP activity was found in OVX mice, and this was not changed acutely by any of the estradiol treatments. However, on the afternoon of the expected LH surge, the same oscillating baseline activity with associated transients occurred for 7.1{+/-}0.5 h. These observations reveal an unexpected prolonged oscillatory pattern of RP3VKISS neuron activity that is dependent on estrogen and underlies the preovulatory LH surge as well as potentially other facets of reproductive behavior.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Neuronal effects of epicranial current stimulation in macaque cortex",
      "content": "BackgroundTranscranial electrical stimulation (TES) using scalp electrodes is noninvasive, safe and inexpensive. However, because the scalp shunts most of the current, electric fields (E-fields) in the brain are relatively weak. Conversely, invasive neuromodulation methods such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and invasive cortical stimulation (ICS) successfully treat many brain diseases. However, the expensive and risky surgery limits the reach of these approaches. Epicranial current stimulation (ECS), where electrodes are implanted on the skull, is a novel approach which can bridge the gap between these two extremes. In current study we investigated the effects of ECS on neural activity.MethodsIn two macaque monkeys we implanted two concentric ring electrodes directly on the skull. Each electrode targeted one area PFG (PFG is not an acronym; rather it is the full name of a particular part of the parietal cortex) of the parietal convexity. Furthermore, a craniotomy was drilled in the skull to access the same area PFG. While recording (2\u202fmin) we stimulated (during the second recording minute) with a 10 or 40\u202fHz sinewave using an unfocused montage (between two electrodes on each side of the head) or a focused (through the concentric electrodes) over an intensity range of 0.25 to 4\u202fmA. These two montages allowed us to investigate neural responses to targeted and broad brain stimulation. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment we stimulated, at only 10\u202fHz, through an unfocused montage.ResultsOur results show that E-field strengths depended on a combination of montage and stimulation intensity. Depending on the montage stimulation caused entrainment as well as spike rate increases. For focused stimulation and unfocused stimulation at lower amplitudes neural activity became entrained to the stimulation (similar to TES). For the unfocused stimulation, as stimulation amplitude increased, spike-rates also increased (similar to ICS and DBS) while the unfocused did not affect spike rates. The fMRI study showed a distributed pattern of activations which is suggestive of a network response caused by ECS.ConclusionECS has been used as a proxy for transcutaneous stimulation in rodent setups. Here we show that as a standalone technique it can be applied to a larger and more complex brain. This makes it a promising neuromodulation approach with clinical applications in patients who do not respond to TES but are not yet candidates for ICS or DBS.",

      "title": "Biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s disease modification using adaptive cognitive assessments to improve responsiveness\u2014a simulation study",
      "content": "IntroductionClinical studies assessing cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases require endpoints that are sensitive to treatment response across a broad range of cognitive abilities. However, responsiveness of conventional cognitive assessments typically varies with the performance level, especially due to non-linearities such as floor or ceiling effects. Here, we evaluate 6 newly developed smartphone-based and gamified Adaptive Cognitive Assessments (ACAs) entailing a system of dynamic difficulty adaptation to individual performance, which is expected to improve adherence but also measurement properties. Deployment of such ACAs to maximize their discriminative ability in comparative studies requires exploration of many free parameters and complex dynamics.MethodsIn simulations of cohorts of patients with cognitive impairment, we compared two ACAs paradigms: after 14 daily tests allowing performance-based difficulty adaptation, the difficulty level was either (1) fixed or (2) kept adaptive for a period of 4\u202fyears with weekly testing. Sensitivity to between-group effects was assessed in cohorts characterized by cognitive decline observed in neurodegenerative diseases.ResultsThe discriminative ability of the two paradigms depends on features of the study design and subjects. At study end, the adaptive difficulty paradigm clearly outperformed the fixed-difficulty paradigm in terms of responsiveness for cognitive decline rates >2.5% per year.DiscussionACA can increase biomarker responsiveness to treatment effects over fixed difficulty. ACA deployment should be guided by study and assessment features, including duration, expected cognitive decline rates and effect size. In the high-dimensional parameter space of ACA instruments, study simulations are indispensable to identify suitable deployment strategies.",
