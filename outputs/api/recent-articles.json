      "title": "The effect of data preprocessing on spike correlation analysis results",
      "content": "In recent years, an increasing number of large electrophysiological data sets have become publicly available, thereby providing researchers with the opportunity to analyze spike train data without conducting their own experiments. While this is undoubtedly a positive development, it increases the need for proper documentation on how the data were collected and what preprocessing was performed on the data, since interpreting analysis results in ignorance of these pieces of information can lead to wrong conclusions. An important preprocessing step is the removal of artifacts from the recordings. Electrophysiological recordings are particularly susceptible to electrical cross-talks between recording channels, resulting in artifact spikes that are coincident in multiple channels on the time scale of the data sampling rate, i.e., 1/30 ms in popular setups. The removal by signal whitening is only possible if also the raw sampled data are available, thus to eliminate this type of artifact is to remove all coincident spikes on the recording time scale to definitely avoid artifact spikes. However, given the lack of the \"ground truth\", this step has the potential to eliminate, in conjunction with the artifacts, components of the data that are pertinent to the research objective. In this study, we use a modified version of the Unitary Event Analysis and demonstrate that such preprocessing results in significantly lower correlations than expected by chance even on longer time scales. We also propose a method to correct for the bias introduced by this preprocessing. Thus, slight changes in the preprocessing have potentially strong impact on analysis results and methods need to consider these effects.",

      "title": "snRNA-seq of Huntington's disease mice reveals vulnerability profiles of cortical cell types",
      "content": "A common feature of neurodegeneration is selective vulnerability, where certain neurons succumb to disease, while others remain spared. The molecular underpinnings of these differences remain elusive. Here, we performed transcriptomic profiling of the motor cortex in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), an incurable hereditary movement disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene. Strikingly, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed a clear transcriptomic separation of HD and control samples within the vulnerable glutamatergic, but not disease-resistant GABAergic cell clusters. Tissue sampling at different time points allowed us to delineate a two-stage disease trajectory with distinct changes at early and late stages. Analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated progressive dysregulation of neuronal cell-type identity and upregulation of ER-phagy receptors. Mechanistic investigations in cellular HD models revealed increased ER-phagy, while knockdown of the ER-phagy receptor Tex264 resulted in elevated levels of the ER stress marker BiP, suggesting a protective role of ER-phagy in HD. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of differential neuronal vulnerability, and identify ER-phagy as a new pathway in HD pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Training neural networks from scratch in a videogame leads to brittle brain encoding",
      "content": "Recent brain-encoding studies using videogame tasks suggest that the training objective of an artificial neural network plays a central role in how well the network's representations align with brain activity. This study investigates the alignment of artificial neural network activations with brain activity elicited by a video game task using models trained from scratch in controlled settings. We specifically compared three model training objectives: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and a vision task, while accounting for other potential factors which may impact performance such as training data and model architecture. We tested models on brain encoding, i.e. their ability to predict functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals acquired while human subjects played different levels of the video game Super Mario Bros. When tested on new playthroughs from the game levels seen at training, the reinforcement learning objective had a small but significant advantage in brain encoding, followed by the imitation learning and vision models. We hypothesized that brain-aligned representations would emerge only in task-competent models, and that the specific brain regions well encoded by a model would depend on the nature of the task it was trained on. While brain encoding did improve during model training, even an untrained model with matching architecture approached the performance of the best models. Contrary to our hypotheses, no model layers or specific training objectives aligned preferentially with specific brain areas. Large performance gaps also persisted in fully trained models across game levels, both those seen during training and entirely novel ones. Overall, even though reinforcement learning presented a small advantage to train brain encoding models for videogame data, all tested brain encoding models exhibited brittle performance with limited generalization both within- and out-of-distribution. Overall, our results suggest that training small artificial models from scratch is not sufficiently reliable, and that incorporating pretrained models such as foundation vision-action models may ultimately be necessary to support robust inferences about brain representations.",

      "title": "Neurodynamics of prefrontal areas in volitional contexts: a comparative study based on computational modelling and EEG/ERP data",
      "content": "Volitional action arises from the interaction between internal intentions and external stimuli, yet the neural dynamics distinguishing self-initiated from externally triggered actions remain unclear. Here, we combine human EEG/ERP data with simulations from a phenomenological neurocomputational model of prefrontal control to examine the neurodynamic principles underlying different types of volitional behaviors. Using an extended version of our previously developed model, we generated neural activity patterns corresponding to self-initiated and externally triggered actions by manipulating the balance between endogenous and exogenous inputs to lateral prefrontal subregions. We then qualitatively compared these simulated dynamics with empirical EEG data from a perceptual decision-making task involving voluntary and instructed skip actions.  Across both datasets, self-initiated actions showed a gradual buildup of activity, marked reductions in cross-trial variability, sharper state transitions, and beta-gamma frequency shifts; in contrast, externally triggered actions exhibited minimal variability reduction, weaker transitions, and largely stable frequency content. These convergent results suggest that self-initiated actions are supported by distinct preparatory dynamics, characterized by internal competition and stabilization of neural states, whereas externally triggered actions rely primarily on externally driven input. Together, these findings identify candidate neurodynamic signatures of intention formation and highlight how simplified computational models can reproduce and help explain key features of volitional control observed in human electrophysiology.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental origin of seizures in Lowe syndrome",
      "content": "Lowe syndrome (LS) is a rare X-linked monogenic disorder resulting from mutations in the OCRL1 gene that encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase enzyme. Patients with LS exhibit a range of neurological symptoms, including neurodevelopmental delays, hypotonia, febrile seizures, and behavioural abnormalities; however, the cellular and developmental origins of LS remain poorly understood. The Drosophila genome encodes a single homolog of OCRL (docrl). Here, we report that a germline null allele of docrl (docrlKO) shows heat induced seizures reminiscent of the febrile seizures in LS patients. Cell type specific deletion of docrl in neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the heat induced seizures seen in docrlKO indicating a cell autonomous requirement of docrl in neurons to prevent seizures. Temporally controlled deletion of docrl showed that heat induced seizure in adults were predetermined by a requirement of docrl in neural stem cells during embryonic neurogenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the developmental origin of the neurological manifestations of LS highlighting the need to target potential therapeutic interventions during this developmental time window.",

      "title": "Gonadal Hormone Status Dictates Neurobehavioral, Metabolic and Immunological Benefits of Ketogenic Diet in Female Mice through Gut-Metabolic-Brain Axis",
      "content": "The ketogenic diet (KD) is recognized for its broad therapeutic potential across metabolic, neurological, immunological, and aging-related domains; however, its efficacy and durability in females remain underexplored. This study investigated the effects of a short-term, intermittent KD on neurobehavioral function, lipid metabolism, immune response, and gut microbiota composition in sham-operated (intact) and ovariectomized (OVX, estrogen-deficient) female mice, aiming to delineate the interactions between diet and gonadal hormones. In sham females, KD reduced circulating estradiol levels and induced low-grade systemic inflammation, without producing measurable behavioral benefits. Conversely, KD exhibited reduced compulsivity, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors with improved well-being in OVX females, suggesting enhanced neurobehavioral resilience under estrogen-deficient conditions. Biochemical analyses revealed KD-induced hyperlipidemia in both groups, although the lipid load was attenuated in OVX mice. KD further decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but led to uremia and histopathological evidence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in OVX females, despite unaltered liver function markers. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed hormone-dependent remodelling of the gut microbiota, characterised by distinct compositional shifts between the sham and OVX cohorts. Correlation analyses linked microbial alterations to improved lipid profiles and reduced anxiodepressive behaviors, implicating the gut-metabolic-brain axis in mediating the effects of KD. Collectively, these findings suggest that KD confers neurobehavioral and metabolic benefits in the absence of ovarian hormones but may also pose risks to the liver and kidneys. These results highlight ketogenic nutrition as a potential non-pharmacological strategy to mitigate menopause- and aging-associated neurobehavioral, metabolic, and immune dysfunctions through modulation of the gut microbiota.",

      "title": "Cues for odor naming affect performance and brain connectivity",
      "content": "Human olfactory perception and naming represent a complex example of multisensory integration, with growing interest in how cues from different modalities affect olfactory recognition and naming. While studies show that visual cues may support odor naming performance, little is known about how cueing and multisensory integration in odor naming tasks influence neural mechanisms. This study examined the cognitive mechanisms underlying odor identification and the effect of two visual cue types\u2014lexical and color\u2014using behavioral and EEG methods. It also investigated the impact of hedonic ratings, Tip of the Nose phenomenon, familiarity, and subjective recall experiences on odor naming. Forty participants took part in an odor identification task using Sniffin\u2019 Sticks. For each trial, an odorant was first presented, followed by either a visual cue (a color patch associated with the odor source) or a lexical cue (a word fragment). Participants were then asked to name the odor. To examine the neural mechanisms involved in cue-assisted odor identification, the time window during odor naming after the visual cue presentation was analyzed. Connectivity analysis and behavioral performance were assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of the different cue types in supporting identification. Behavioral findings showed that lexical cues improved identification accuracy. Furthermore, hedonic ratings, familiarity, and experiences related to the TON were found to significantly affect naming performance. Odor familiarity and liking levels affected both response accuracy and response time, with more familiar and liked odors being identified both more accurately and more quickly. Granger causality analysis revealed that the color cue condition exhibited more numerous and stronger network connections compared to the lexical cue condition. The lexical cue condition demonstrated more restricted network activation with fewer connections, utilizing focused frontal-temporal and frontal-parietal circuits. In both conditions, prefrontal regions served as strong control hubs, and language networks were preserved. However, additional frontal-occipital connections were observed in the color cue condition, in the form of interhemispheric coordination and visual system integration. The findings demonstrated that cross-modal odor naming utilizes different neural connections depending on cue type, with lexical cues showing more direct access to linguistic areas while color cues exhibit more complex connectivity patterns.",

      "title": "Evaluating group interactions in epileptic brain networks by hypergraph and higher-order homophily",
      "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

Users on our platform receive alerts/notifications, and I\u2019ve been asked to build a POC that sends each user a daily message through: Email, Microsoft Teams</p> <p>The message is something simple like: \u201cHey {user}, you have X unseen alerts on our platform. Please log in to review them.\u201d No conversations, no replies, no chat logic. just a one-time, user-specific daily notification.</p> <p>Since this message is per user and not a broadcast, I\u2019m trying to figure out the cleanest and most future-proof approach for Teams.</p> <p>Looking for suggestions from anyone who\u2019s done this before:</p> <ul> <li>What approach worked best for user-specific messages?</li> <li>Is using the Microsoft Graph API enough for this use case?</li> <li>Any issues with permissions, throttling, app-only auth, or Teams quirks?</li> <li>Any docs, examples, or blogs you\u2019d recommend?</li> </ul> <p>Basically, the entire job of this integration is to Notify the user once per day on Teams that they have X unseen alerts on our platform. the suggestions i have been getting so far is to use python.</p> <p>Any help or direction would be really appreciated.
