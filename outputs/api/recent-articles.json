      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "An algorithmic procedure for measuring deep brain stimulation-induced capsular activation using motor evoked potentials",
      "content": "Objective. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of surgical targeting and DBS programming.",

      "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",
