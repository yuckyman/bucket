      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've been thinking about how you would unit test code performance, and come up with:</p> <ol> <li>Big-O scaling, which I wrote an article about here: <a href=\"https://pythonspeed.com/articles/big-o-tests/\">https://pythonspeed.com/articles/big-o-tests/</a></li> <li>Algorithmic efficiency more broadly, so measuring your code's speed in a way that is more than just scalability but is mostly fairly agnostic to hardware. This can be done in unit tests with things like Cachegrind/Callgrind, which simulate a CPU very minimally, and therefore can give you CPU instruction counts that are consistent across machines. And then combine that with snapshot testing and some wiggle room to take noise (e.g. from Python randomized hash seed) into account. Hope to write an article about this too eventually.</li> <li>The downside of the second approach is that it won't tell you about performance improvements or regressions that rely on CPU functionality like instruction-level parallelism. This is mostly irrelevant to pure Python code, but can come up with compiled Python extensions. This requires more elaborate setups because you're starting to rely on CPU features and different models are different. The simplest way I know of is in a PR: on a single machine (or GitHub Action run), run a benchmark in on `main`, run it on your branch, compare the difference.</li> </ol> <p>Any other ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/itamarst\"> /u/itamarst </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6q9hj/unit_testing_the_performance_of_your_code/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6q9hj/unit_testing_the_performance_of_your_code/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Prolonged esports play can induce cognitive fatigue by placing sustained demands on executive control, decision-making, and stress regulation. Since the brain relies primarily on glucose as an immediate energy source, we hypothesized that a carbohydrate gel designed to prolong post-ingestion glycaemia stabilizes interstitial glucose, attenuates hunger and cognitive fatigue, and helps preserve performance during extended esports play. Eleven healthy young men completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study with two sessions in which they ingested one of two carbohydrate gels matched for total energy and total carbohydrate but differing in carbohydrate composition (high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]-dominant vs maltodextrin [MDX]-dominant) before gameplay. Interstitial glucose was monitored continuously, while hunger, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, executive function, and in-game performance were assessed repeatedly. Compared with the control (HFCS-dominant) condition, the glycaemia-prolonging formulation maintained higher interstitial glucose levels during the later phase of gameplay, blunted the progressive increase in hunger, and attenuated cortisol responses. These physiological and subjective advantages were accompanied by better executive control and more adaptive defensive behaviors in-game, including fewer fouls and more interceptions. In contrast, pupil diameter, an index of global arousal, remained unchanged across conditions, suggesting that benefits were not driven by altered arousal but by improved glycaemic stability and appetite regulation. These findings indicate that a carbohydrate formulation that prolongs glycaemia can reduce hunger-linked cognitive fatigue and support task-relevant behavior during prolonged esports play. This low-burden nutritional strategy may help sustain mental performance during prolonged digital activities that impose high cognitive demands.",
