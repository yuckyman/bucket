      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

      "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

      "content": "Children from Bulgaria (N\u202f=\u202f120) were tested on language and Theory of Mind (ToM) development. Sixty were ethnic bilingual Turkish children, and 60 were monolingual ethnic Bulgarian children. The age of the children varied between 3;6 to 5;0\u202fyears old. Both groups of children in the study were tested in their mother tongues (Turkish and Bulgarian); the Turkish children were also tested in their second language (L2)\u2014Bulgarian, with a language test and Theory of Mind test. Theory of Mind was tested with classical tasks plus a non-verbal ToM task, and the language test comprised measures of wh-complements and evidentiality marking. The hypotheses tested were: H1: The comprehension and production of wh-complements in the mother tongue (L1) at ages 3\u20136\u202fyears will support the understanding of ToM in their second language (L2). H2: Understanding \u201cevidentiality\u201d marking in the mother tongue will support an understanding of false belief ToM tasks in both languages. The results show that the Turkish-speaking children had a lower level of understanding of the classical ToM tasks than the Bulgarian monolingual children, but have equivalent results on the non-verbal ToM task. In the language test, the Turkish-speaking children were better in wh-complements, but weaker in performing the evidentiality test than the Bulgarian monolinguals. The predictors of performance in classic ToM tasks were different from the two ethnic groups: for the Bulgarian monolinguals, performance on the evidentiality test was the best predictor, but for Turkish bilingual children, performance on the low verbal tasks was the only predictor other than age, for both L1 and L2 ToM.",

      "title": "The effects of amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation on working memory of college students",
      "content": "BackgroundRecent studies suggest that amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) may enhance cognitive functions, but its mechanisms and optimal application remain unclear.MethodsThirty-three healthy university students were randomly assigned to Sham, tACS (40 Hz, 1 mA, bilateral prefrontal cortex), or AM-tACS (200 Hz carrier frequency) groups, in AM-tACS, the baseband modulation frequency was individualized based on the pre-task phase-locking value (PLV) derived from occipitofrontal EEG. Working memory (WM) was assessed via a delayed-match-to-sample task (accuracy and sensitivity index d\u2019).ResultsCompared to Sham, the tACS group showed significant WM accuracy improvement (p < 0.05). AM-tACS exhibited a smaller but statistically significant enhancement in d\u2019 (p < 0.05). EEG analysis revealed no PLV increase between stimulated regions, but a trend toward heightened frontal-occipital functional connectivity.ConclusionAmplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation effectively enhances WM in college students, though physiological mechanisms require further investigation with multimodal approaches. The compatibility of AM-tACS with real-time EEG monitoring highlights its potential for closed-loop neuromodulation systems, where stimulation parameters could be dynamically adjusted based on neural feedback.",

      "title": "Brain temporal dynamics correlate with clinical traits, spontaneous arm movements, and recovery in middle cerebral artery stroke",
      "content": "ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to look into the brain functional network changes and their possible correlations with clinical traits, spontaneous arm movements, and recovery in middle cerebral artery stroke.MethodsThe study included 34 patients with acute cerebral infarction (CI) at middle artery and upper limb dyskinesia, as well as 50 healthy control (HC) participants. The spontaneous activity data of both upper limbs were recorded using a wrist activity recorder for 24\u202fh. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scales were then completed 90\u202fdays after the stroke onset. Resting-state EEG was acquired from both the CI and HC groups, and brain network features were examined using the microstate analysis. The correlations between microstates, spontaneous activity and clinical traits were investigated.ResultsCompared with the HC group, the CI group had a higher MsB duration, lower MsC coverage and occurrence, and a decrease in both MsA and MsB to MsC as well as a decrease in MsC to MsA (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); only the transition from MsC to MsB was enhanced; Reduced MsD coverage, occurrence, and duration when patients had larger FMA scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); The MsB to MsA and MsD significantly correlated with FMA. Moreover, we found increased MsC coverage and duration, as well as the transition rates of MsA and MsD to MsC in those patients with mRS scores larger than one at 90\u202fdays after stroke (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Parts of Ms parameters involving MsA significantly correlated with mRS at 90\u202fdays after stroke.ConclusionThe dynamic balance of brain networks is altered when cerebral infarction occurs, and microstates offer a portion of the functional brain network foundation that allows us to recognize these alterations. These changes in temporal dynamic parameters effectively suggest the clinical traits and functional recovery in CI.",

      "content": "IntroductionSpatial memory supports orientation and navigation by integrating multiple spatial reference frames. Neuroimaging and lesion studies implicate the hippocampus (HIP) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), but causal evidence from non-invasive brain stimulation is limited.MethodsEighteen participants performed a spatial localization task in a virtual room under three stimulation conditions: anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left RSC, anodal tDCS over the left HIP, and sham. Task conditions varied in reference frame (viewer-, object-, room-centered) and perspective shift (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 135\u00b0). Accuracy was analyzed with non-parametric statistics.ResultsPerformance declined with increasing viewpoint rotation, especially in room-centered trials. RSC stimulation selectively reduced accuracy in room-centered trials with large perspective shifts (135\u00b0), whereas HIP stimulation did not significantly modulate performance.DiscussionFindings provide causal evidence for the involvement of the RSC in viewpoint-invariant spatial updating, supporting its role in integrating stable environmental cues. HIP stimulation yielded no reliable behavioral effects, suggesting functional specificity of the RSC and highlighting the challenges of modulating deep cortical structures with tDCS.",
