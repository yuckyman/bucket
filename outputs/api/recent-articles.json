      "title": "Passage of time at the level of milliseconds: a new approach and a selective difficulty in individuals with schizophrenia",
      "content": "Individuals with schizophrenia report that to them time sometimes feels discontinuous. Previous work has shown a link between the sense of self, and the ability to prepare to react to a target and to benefit from the passage of time, at the level of a few hundreds of milliseconds. However, the sense of time continuity requires a higher time resolution than examined in previous studies. Here we investigate to which extent individuals with schizophrenia and controls benefit from an increased delay when detecting asynchronies in the order of tens of milliseconds (stimulus onset asynchronies, i.e. SOA) between two successive visual stimuli. We re-analyzed three datasets and contrasted performance when the SOA increases, remains identical or decreases from trial t-1 to trial t. Performance of all participants improved with an increase in the SOA, as the task became easier, but for controls more so than individuals with schizophrenia. These results are replicated across datasets, and were specific to the condition when SOA increased from one trial to the next. There was no significant group difference when the SOA decreased or remained identical. This was true even when the latter condition was more frequent, and when SOA magnitude was equalized across the conditions. Importantly, the difference between the two groups was specific to temporal judgements, and was not observed in a control masking task. We suggest the results reveal a difficulty for individuals with schizophrenia to experience time at the level of milliseconds.",

      "title": "Dynamical Interrogation of Serpentine Medulla Circuits in the Drosophila Optic Lobe",
      "content": "Dense connectomes invite a tempting leap: if we can \"wire up\" a circuit, perhaps its dynamics (and even its function) will emerge. In practice, connectomic constraints leave large biophysical degrees of freedom (synapse signs/strengths, neuromodulation, gap junctions), so qualitative dynamical claims can be fragile. We present a simple forensic workflow for testing connectome-to-dynamics hypotheses that is deliberately hostile to wishful thinking: each stage is gated by sanity checks, run across multiple random seeds, and reported with effect sizes and negative controls. As a case study, we instantiate the Serpentine Medulla (Sm) interneuron family from FlyWire as a current-based adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) network and test a sharp narrative: whether strong recurrence supports a working-memory-style bistable attractor. Under strict attractor criteria (noise removed after the kick), we find no robust evidence for bistability (paired Wilcoxon p = 0.099, within-subject dz = -0.25). For oscillations, a corrected reproduction across 20 random seeds shows that recurrent coupling strongly amplifies integrated 30-80 Hz power when comparing the fully coupled condition (Full W) to an uncoupled control (W = 0) (paired Wilcoxon p = 1.9 x 10-6; dz = 5.96). We also observe a fast negative-coupling signature in input decomposition (mean peak correlation r {approx} -0.40 at ~ 4 ms lag), while stressing that these signatures are conditional on the chosen model class and operating point. Overall, the main contribution is methodological: an auditable template for falsifying attractive connectome-based stories rather than polishing them.",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Will and Jorge, and we\u2019ve built LAD (Language-Aided Design), a SolidWorks add-in that uses LLMs to create sketches, features, assemblies, and macros from conversational inputs (<a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a>).<p>We come from software engineering backgrounds where tools like Claude Code and Cursor have come to dominate, but when poking around CAD systems a few months back we realized there's no way to go from a text prompt input to a modeling output in any of the major CAD systems. In our testing, the LLMs aren't as good at making 3D objects as they are are writing code, but we think they'll get a lot better in the upcoming months and years.<p>To bridge this gap, we've created LAD, an add-in in SolidWorks to turn conversational input and uploaded documents/images into parts, assemblies, and macros. It includes:<p>- Dozens of tools the LLM can call to create sketches, features, and other objects in parts.<p>- Assembly tools the LLM can call to turn parts into assemblies.<p>- File system tools the LLM can use to create, save, search, and read SolidWorks files and documentation.<p>- Macro writing/running tools plus a SolidWorks API documentation search so the LLM can use macros.<p>- Automatic screenshots and feature tree parsing to provide the LLM context on the current state.<p>- Checkpointing to roll back unwanted edits and permissioning to determine which commands wait for user permission.<p>You can try LAD at <a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a> and let us know what features would make it more useful for your work. We\u2019d love your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
