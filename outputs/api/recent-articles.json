      "title": "I built a Django-style boilerplate for FastAPI",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with Django for a long time, and I love it's philosophy, the structure, the CLI, and how easy it is to spin up new apps.</p> <p>When I started using FastAPI, I loved the performance and simplicity, but I often find myself spending a lot of time just setting up the architecture.</p> <p>I decided to build a boilerplate for FastAPI + SQLAlchemy to bridge that gap. I call it <strong>Djast</strong>.</p> <p><strong>What is Djast</strong> Djast is essentially <strong>FastAPI + SQLAlchemy</strong>, but organized like a Django project. It is <strong>not</strong> a wrapper that hides FastAPI\u2019s internal logic. It\u2019s a project template designed to help you hit the ground running without reinventing the architecture every time.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Django-style CLI:</strong> It includes a <code>manage.py</code> that handles commands like <code>startapp</code> (to create modular apps), <code>makemigrations</code>, <code>migrate</code>, and <code>shell</code>.</li> <li><strong>Smart Migrations:</strong> It wraps Alembic to mimic the Django workflow (<code>makemigrations</code> / <code>migrate</code>). It even detects table/column renames interactively so you don't lose data, and warns you about dangerous operations.</li> <li><strong>Familiar ORM Wrapper:</strong> It uses standard async SQLAlchemy, but includes a helper to provide a Django-like syntax for common queries (e.g., <code>await Item.objects(session).get(id=1)</code>).</li> <li><strong>Pydantic Integration:</strong> A helper method to generate Pydantic schemas directly from your DB models (similar to <code>ModelForm</code> concepts) helps to keep your code DRY.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Shell:</strong> A pre-configured IPython shell that auto-imports your models and handles the async session for you.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> This is for Django developers who want to try FastAPI but feel &quot;homesick&quot; for the Django structure and awesome quality-of-life features, or for FastAPI developers who want a more opinionated, battle-tested project layout.</p> <p>I decided to share it in hope that this is as usefull to you as it is to me. I would also appreciate some feedback. If you have time to check it out, I\u2019d love to hear what you think about the structure or if there are features you think are missing.</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast</a> <strong>Quickstart:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgtGreg\"> /u/AgtGreg </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Flexible selection of working memory representations to reduce cognitive cost",
      "content": "Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.",

      "title": "High-Frequency Activity Encodes the Temporal Dynamics of Hierarchical Prediction Errors in Humans: An Electrocorticography Study",
      "content": "Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.",
