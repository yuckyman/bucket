      "title": "Cognition Disconnected: The Influence of Domain-General Cognition (g) in Lesion-Deficit Mapping",
      "content": "Lesion-deficit mapping is a premier technique for dissociating neural correlates of cognitive functions. However, the contribution of domain-general cognition (g) to the performance of virtually all complex behavioral tasks may encumber such efforts. This possibility has been largely unexplored. Here, we examined the influence of g in lesion-deficit mapping using a combination of structural equation modeling, lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), and structural (sLNM) and functional (fLNM) lesion network mapping. We modeled latent variables for visuospatial ability, processing speed, language, and anterograde memory among 473 patients with focal brain damage (age range 20-93, 257 men, 216 women), both with and without g-associated variance embedded within each factor. Lesion-deficit maps for domain-specific cognitive abilities were statistically significantly less spatially inter-correlated after partitioning out g (p = 0.010 for LBM; p = 0.003 for sLNM; p = 0.003 for fLNM). Lesion-deficit maps also implicated the existence of distinct neuroanatomy for specific cognitive domains that was, in many cases, only apparent and clearly distinct from lesion-deficit maps of g after partitioning out the influence of g. Overall, our findings suggest that, if left unaccounted for, domain-general cognitive variance could tangibly affect conclusions about the extent to which different cognitive functions rely on distinct neuroanatomy.",

      "title": "Data-driven Cognitive Clusters in Persistent Developmental Dyslexia",
      "content": "Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent reading difficulties despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. The cognitive underpinnings of dyslexia remain incompletely understood. Although multiple causal pathways have been proposed, there is a gap in studies that can reliably identify dyslexia subtypes based on comprehensive evaluations that go beyond measures of reading and phonology. We employed one of the largest detailed samples of children with developmental dyslexia resistant to intervention, consisting of 147 extensively phenotyped school-age children aged 7-14 years who were recruited from specialized schools for students with learning differences. We implemented data-driven analyses leveraging a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to delineate cognitive subdomains and characterize the heterogeneity in the sample. Hierarchical clustering of 24 cognitive measures aided in constructing a framework to subsequently interpret emerging clusters. Four clusters emerged, predominantly associated with: Processing Speed & Executive Function, Visuospatial & Mathematical Reasoning, Phonological Manipulation, and Verbal Short-term Memory & Word Retrieval. Subsequent latent profile analysis identified two distinct dyslexia profiles: one characterized by marked difficulties in executive functioning and processing speed, and another displaying impairments primarily in verbal short-term memory and word retrieval relative to the other profile. Importantly, both profiles exhibited comparable severity of persistent reading difficulties despite their divergent cognitive profiles. These findings show that phenotypically similar reading impairments can arise from distinct underlying cognitive factors, emphasizing the role of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in developing tailored interventions for affected children.",

      "title": "Modelling mental disorders in zebrafish. Neurexins severely modulate anxiety, social behaviours and aggression.",
      "content": "Can we reproduce mental disorders in zebrafish? To explore this question, we manipulated the neurexin gene family. Neurexin (nrxn) genes encode synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that have been repetitively associated with neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. While the zebrafish animal model offers tremendous advantages for dissecting neural development/function, no robust nrxn zebrafish models are currently available. In this study, we generated the first collection of zebrafish knockout lines for each nrxn gene, with mutations ranging from transmembrane domain- to full genomic locus-deletions. Surprisingly, all homozygous lines developed normally, presenting no gross neurodevelopmental or obvious early behavioural abnormalities. However, this absence of early phenotypes translated into profound, paralog-specific behavioural alterations emerging during juvenile-to-adult stages. All neurexin knockouts affected mating behaviour, complicating the generation and maintenance of homozygous lines. Except for this shared behavioural alteration, nrxn1, but not nrxn2 or nrxn3, led to marked changes in social behaviour and aggression. In contrast, nrxn2 mutants exhibited severe anxiety-like behaviours, including bottom-dwelling and repetitive freezing/seizure events. Strikingly, nrxn1 full-locus deletion mutants showed opposing behaviour, spending most of their time near the surface. The two also displayed opposite responses to open/closed field transitions; confinement alleviated nrxn2 anxiety but enhanced nrxn1 surface-dwelling. Meanwhile, nrxn3 mutants behaved normally in all our initial tests. In summary, our study introduces a complete set of zebrafish mutants covering the whole nrxn gene family, presenting striking juvenile/adult behavioural alterations despite the absence of noticeable early defects; echoing the delayed onset of human psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. This work demonstrates the value of zebrafish to study mental disorders and unlock a novel platform to unravel the pathogenic contribution of neurexin and associated subtle neurodevelopmental changes/timing that drive the emergence of mental illnesses.",

      "title": "Understanding cortical computation through the lens of joint-embedding predictive architectures",
      "content": "Tracking prey or recognizing a lurking predator is as crucial for survival as anticipating their actions. To guide behavior, the brain must extract information about object identities and their dynamics from entangled sensory inputs. How it accomplishes this feat remains an open question. Predictive coding theories propose that this ability arises by comparing predicted sensory signals with actual inputs and reducing the associated prediction errors. However, existing models rely on generative architectures that compute prediction errors directly in the input space, which is hard to reconcile with neural anatomy. Here, we develop a theory that avoids this issue by operating solely on internal representations. Specifically, we introduce recurrent predictive learning (RPL), a recurrent joint-embedding predictive architecture inspired by self-supervised machine learning, that learns abstract representations of object identity and their dynamics and predicts future object motion. Crucially, the model learns sequence representations that resemble successor-like representations observed in the primary visual cortex of humans. The model also develops abstract sequence representations comparable to those reported in the macaque prefrontal cortex. Finally, we outline how RPL's modular feedforward-recurrent organization could map onto canonical cortical microcircuits as a plausible model of cortical representation learning. Our work establishes a circuit-centric theory framework that unifies predictive processing with self-supervised learning, providing a fresh perspective on how the brain acquires an internal model of the world.",

      "title": "Synaptic MEMOIR: mapping individual synapses of neurons with protein barcodes",
      "content": "Obtaining wiring diagrams of brains has been a major achievement for neuroscience. However, an underlying challenge in connectomics is the fundamental tradeoff between the imaging resolution needed to resolve synapses and the volume of the brain that can be imaged. For example, electron microscopy (EM) visualizes synaptic sites with ~5 nm resolution, but is difficult to scale beyond volumes of 1 mm3. Here, we present Synaptic MEMOIR (Memory with Engineered Mutagenesis with Optical in situ Readout) that enables imaging of neuronal projections in animal brains with single-synapse resolution. Synaptic MEMOIR is built around three key design features. First, protein barcodes are transported to synapses to allow matching of synaptic barcodes to cell body barcodes without high resolution imaging and the error-prone process of tracing neuronal processes across long distances. Second, Synaptic MEMOIR uses continuous mutagenesis to generate a large diversity of barcodes to uniquely label cell bodies and synapses. Last, the timing of recombination and transport can be tuned to record synaptic age or projection information. Combining these features, we demonstrated projection mapping of 113 neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe in a volume of 9.5 million m3. Because synapses are identified by transported barcodes with optical microscopy at 300 nm resolution, this approach can potentially scale to much larger volumes, similar at least to those imaged in recent mouse brain transcriptomics atlases. In addition, synaptic MEMOIR can match barcodes across brain sections, and does not require tissue clearing to track long-range projections. Together, these results provide the foundation for a scalable optical image-based system for reconstructing the neural wiring diagrams of brains across different developmental stages, genetic backgrounds and perturbations.",

      "title": "A default-control network cortical gradient differentiates the imagination of social and solitary experiences",
      "content": "Understanding the neural activity underlying spontaneous thought - when attention shifts from external tasks to internally generated content - is a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. However, research on such internal states has lagged external task-related studies of brain activity, partly due to challenges surrounding controlling and recording self-generated thought. Recent advances suggest that a neural activation gradient underlies transitions between external and internally focused cognitive states, separating opposing activation/deactivation of frontoparietal control and default mode networks along a continuum. To characterize internal cognitive states associated with this neural gradient, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants imagined a variety of personal scenarios prompted by generic text cues (e.g., party, housework), mimicking self-generated thought. Prior to scanning, participants verbally described the scenarios and rated their experiential features. Gradient-space analysis identified a cognitive transition between imagining (not undertaking) solitary activities (e.g., housework), which activated the frontoparietal network relative to the default mode network, and social activities (e.g., party), which exhibited the reverse pattern. Because all states were internally focused (i.e. imagined) and were self-generated under the same (non-interactive) task, these findings refine the cognitive interpretation of the frontoparietal to default mode gradient, showing that it does not strictly differentiate between external (task-positive) and internal (task-negative) cognitive states.",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "content": "The first six months of life mark a critical window for human brain development, characterized by rapid synaptic formation, axonal growth, and network reorganization. During this period' large-scale functional networks progressively mature. Although prior infant fMRI studies have characterized temporal functional connectivity, the spatial organization and refinement of brain networks during early infancy remain underexplored. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state fMRI from 74 typically developing infants (0-6 months; 137 scans) using group independent component analysis (ICA) with group-information-guided ICA (GIG-ICA) back-reconstruction. Spatial dissimilarity between each infants spatial map and the group-level map was quantified using cosine dissimilarity and Euclidean distance. Generalized additive models were applied to model age-related trends. Both cosine and Euclidean dissimilarity metrics showed significant decreases with age, indicating a progressive convergence of individual network topographies toward the group-level architecture. These findings reveal increasing spatial coherence and refinement of large-scale brain networks during early infancy, suggesting that spatial maturation complements the well-established functional integration observed in temporal connectivity studies.",

      "content": "Schizophrenia (SCZ), a complex psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, is thought to involve, at least in part, dopamine dysregulation in the striatum. Recent large-scale exome sequencing has identified multiple SCZ risk genes, including GRIN2A (encoding an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit) and AKAP11 (encoding a protein kinase A binding protein), which is also a risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD). However, the mechanisms by which these genetic risk factors perturb dopamine circuits and cause psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. We asked how behavior, dorsomedial striatal dopamine (DA) dynamics and the activity of D1-/D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) were altered in Grin2a and Akap11 mutants. In the open field, Grin2a knockout mice display hyperlocomotion and an abnormal organization of naturalistic behaviors. They also displayed heightened behavioral responses to objects and auditory stimuli. Grin2a heterozygous animals mostly showed intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Grin2a loss. Further, Grin2a knockout mutants exhibited aberrant dopamine events, altered coupling of dopamine with locomotor features, and exaggerated stimuli-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, heterozygous animals also showed altered striatal SPN events in the open field reflecting dysregulated neural activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs. Compared to Grin2a mutants, Akap11 mutants displayed opposite phenotypes, showing reduced locomotion with a shift from high- to low-velocity movement and distinct alterations in striatal neural activity. Together, GRIN2A (SCZ risk) and AKAP11 (BD/SCZ risk) mutations induce different, often opposite, effects on striatal dopamine signaling and behavior, suggesting that these two risk genes act through distinct mechanisms.",

      "content": "Early infancy is a crucial period for brain development, during which fundamental functional and structural frameworks are established. Understanding the maturation of large-scale brain networks during this stage is essential for characterizing normative neurodevelopment and identifying potential deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated developmental changes in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in infants using a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset comprising 137 scans from 74 low-likelihood developing infants aged 0-6 months. We applied independent component analysis to extract large-scale brain networks and utilized advanced spatial metrics, including network-averaged spatial similarity (NASS) to assess alignment with group-level patterns, network strength to quantify neural engagement based on voxel intensities, and network size to examine spatial distribution. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in NASS across multiple networks, indicating greater consistency in functional organization over time. Additionally, most networks demonstrated increased network strength, reflecting heightened neural involvement, while network size exhibited distinct developmental trajectories, with some networks expanding and others remaining stable. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of functional brain architecture during early infancy, providing critical insights into neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "content": "The ability to use generalized prior experience to guide behavior in novel situations is a fundamental cognitive function. While recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus supports generalization how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Here we combined longitudinal optical imaging in head-fixed mice with computational modeling to examine generalization in hippocampal area CA1. We found that prior training accelerated behavioral adaptation to a novel environment and that this was accompanied by highly stable hippocampal representations. We identified putative memory traces from prior experience that enabled this generalization at multiple levels. At the population level, novel-context network dynamics rapidly aligned with low-dimensional neural subspaces established during prior experience. At the cellular level, spatially-informative weak ''residual'' activity reflecting generalizable information about the task structure appeared to bias which neurons form place fields (PFs) and where via behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Finally, this was an active process as many PFs changed their reference frame in the novel environment to reflect the consistent task structure. In sum, the influence of memory traces on new PF formation may allow past experience to guide new learning such that representations are based on generalizable features, thus enabling rapid adaptive behavior in new contexts.",

      "title": "Synthesizing images to map neural networks to the human brain",
      "content": "Computational models can be used to generate hypotheses about the brain. In the visual system, this approach has revealed similarities between how natural images are represented in convolutional neural networks and in cortical regions. However, natural images generate highly correlated representations across the hierarchy of model layers, meaning that each brain region will not correspond selectively to a single layer. Because each model layer performs additional image transformations, gaining a more selective mapping between individual layers and regions could reveal how specific algorithmic stages of processing are instantiated in the brain. To enable this mapping, we developed a generative framework for image synthesis that minimizes the similarity of image representational similarity matrices across model layers, aiming to orthogonalize the distances between the patterns of unit activations evoked by the same set of images. With the patterns orthogonalized, the resulting similarity matrix for each layer provides a fingerprint of the unique computational role of that layer. To test this approach, we synthesized 16 artificial images from the Inception-V1/GoogLeNet model and scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed these images repeatedly in random order. Image-specific patterns of voxel activity were used to compute image-by-image similarity matrices across the whole brain with searchlights. Most layers could be mapped to circumscribed cortical regions, and these mappings overlapped less than the mappings obtained with natural images. Given the prevalence of existing fMRI datasets with natural images, we used the synthesis method as a benchmark to develop an alternative residual method that can achieve comparable performance for natural image datasets. These approaches could be extended to other neural network architectures and stimulus modalities for targeted mappings of model computations to the brain and behavior.",

      "content": "Early life stress (ELS) is a strong risk factor for several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and is associated with persistent molecular alterations in corticolimbic regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we combined unbiased proteomics profiling and viral-mediated gene transfer to characterize the enduring epigenetic changes in the PFC of male and female mice previously exposed to ELS. We found that ELS induced sex-specific and age-dependent accumulation of monomethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1), with a transient increase in adolescent females, and a delayed but enduring effect in adult males. ELS-induced H3K27me1 accumulation in the PFC involved changes of SUZ12, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Indeed, expression of the catalytic domain of SUZ12, VEFS, in PFC neurons during adolescence led to sex differences in social and cognitive alterations in adulthood. Together, our results demonstrate that H3K27me1 functions as a chromatin scar in the PFC, mediating lifelong susceptibility to ELS in a sex-specific manner.",

      "title": "Dysregulated lactate metabolism synergizes with ALS genetic risk factors to accelerate motor decline",
      "content": "Neurons rely on glial lactate shuttling for metabolic support, which declines with aging and in neurodegenerative disease. Full disruption of lactate shuttling in peripheral nerves causes progressive axon degeneration, but we were interested to understand how partial disruption, a scenario more relevant to aging and disease, contributes to neurodegeneration risk. Pyruvate and lactate are interconverted by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB) in both lactate producing and consuming cells. We therefore began by investigating Ldhb knockout mice (loss of LDHA, the dominant LDH in liver and muscle, caused embryonic lethality), and discovered that they develop progressive neuromuscular junction atrophy and functional decline without axon degeneration. Because even Ldhb+/- heterozygosity significantly affects motor behavior, we also wondered about a potential link to congenital disease and pursued this by identifying rare loss-of-function LDHB variants among ALS patients. Next, to better understand how LDHB loss leads to motor decline, we selectively deleted it in defined cell types. SC-specific deletion caused robust motor defects, whereas motor neuron-specific deletion has little effect. Reasoning that neuronal LDHB deficiency could model age-associated decline in lactate metabolism, we asked whether it would interact with ALS genetic risk. Indeed, motor-neuron LDHB deficiency synergizes with relatively mild ALS risk variants, TDP43-Q331K and Sod1-D83G knock-in alleles, to produce early motor neuropathy, indicating that LDHB loss enhances disease risk. These findings establish lactate metabolism as a modifier of motor system vulnerability and highlight it as a therapeutic target in peripheral as well as central neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often emerge in adolescence. Identifying their symptom structures and neural biomarkers in youth with elevated risk is critical for early detection and developing interventions. This study investigated the central symptoms of MDD and GAD and identified the key brain regions (brain bridges) linking structural neuroanatomy to symptoms in at-risk adolescents. Methods: A total of 1,568 adolescents at high risk for MDD and 413 adolescents at high risk for GAD were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Participants completed MDD and GAD symptom assessments and underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanning. We constructed 10 psychological network models incorporating symptoms and brain structural indices to identify central symptoms and brain bridges. Results: Concentration difficulties emerged as the shared core symptom, while self-hatred and irritability were the unique central symptoms for MDD and GAD, respectively. Left- and right-pallidum volumes exhibited the highest bridge centrality for MDD symptoms, whereas left-nucleus accumbens volume showed the highest bridge centrality for GAD symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the pallidum and nucleus accumbens as key brain regions linking structural anatomy to symptom networks in high-risk youth. These results provide novel insights into early neurobiological markers of MDD and GAD from a symptom-oriented perspective and may inform targeted interventions.",

Recent research highlights impaired cerebral lymphatic drainage in PD, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.Case presentationWe report a 56-year-old male with advanced PD who underwent deep cervical lymphovenous bypass (DCLB) surgery, a novel intervention designed to enhance lymphatic drainage by anastomosing the deep cervical lymphatic vessel to a vein. The patient had been diagnosed with PD in 2024 after experiencing progressive motor symptoms since 2019, with suboptimal response to conventional pharmacotherapy.ResultsAt three-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed: Movement Disorder Society\u2013Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale decreased by 30.4% (from 23 to 16), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale decreased by 71.4% (from 77 to 22), and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire-39 decreased by 94.2% (from 52 to 3). Both motor symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms (sleep disturbances, orthostatic dizziness) showed improvement.ConclusionDCLB was technically feasible and was followed by symptomatic improvements in this single patient. The underlying mechanism for this clinical response remains unclear and was not investigated with biomarkers in this report. While these preliminary findings are hypothesis-generating, causality cannot be inferred from an individual case. Further controlled studies incorporating neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers are needed to explore potential mechanisms.",
