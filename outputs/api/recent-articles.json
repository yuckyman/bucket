      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
      "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
      "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "title": "Neuronal architecture of the mouse insular cortex underlying its diverse functions",
      "content": "The insular cortex integrates interoceptive and exteroceptive information to mediate bodily homeostasis, emotion, learning, and potentially consciousness. However, the cellular and circuit substrates governing the insula and other associative cortices are poorly understood compared to primary cortices. Here, we quantify the dendritic morphology together with electrical properties, local inputs, and/or projections of 1,093 insular pyramidal neurons. These neurons are mapped onto a quantitative anatomical model of the insula based on a Nissl-staining coordinate framework. Using improved algorithms, we define 21 morphological, 12 electrical, and 9 input neuronal types, and identify several morphological and input types that are unique to the insula. Further, we find that morphological properties constrain and often predict inputs, electrical properties, or projection targets. Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions. Surprisingly, certain neuronal types receive intra-insular inputs originating far beyond canonical cortical columns. Functionally, these connections bridge a long-range thalamus-to-amygdalar circuit that potentially links sensory information to valence. Our work establishes a structure-and-function foundation for investigating the insular cortex.",

      "title": "The novel phenomenon of inter-retinal coupling predicts cortical neurovascular responses in health and disease",
      "content": "It has recently been discovered that physiological crosstalk exists between human retinas. Accordingly, visual stimulation of one retina elicited a neurovascular coupling (NVC) response of the contralateral retina in about 30% of individuals. The functional significance of this feature in health and disease remains unknown. Here, we asked the question whether inter-retina crosstalk predicts the nature of neurovascular coupling in the brain. To test this hypothesis, we assessed BOLD fMRI (blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal) in healthy individuals and a disease model of neurovascular coupling, type 1 diabetes. We used three visual paradigms: a Threshold speed and Sub-maximum speed discrimination tasks, and flicker stimulation. The presence or absence of inter-retinal coupling was predictive of the time course of the cortical hemodynamic response, either during the initial or late phases. The presence of interocular coupling predicted larger BOLD responses. Diabetic patients with interocular coupling showed a very similar profile to the healthy group. In sum, we identified a direct relationship between interocular physiological coupling and cortical hemodynamic responses, suggesting that this NVC response may serve as a disease biomarker in diabetes.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial-Targeted HDAP2 Preserves Retinal Ganglion Cells and Increases Pressure Tolerance in DBA/2J Mice",
      "content": "Purpose: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in glaucoma occurs in a large fraction of patients even after intraocular pressure (IOP) is reduced. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key mechanism that links elevated IOP to RGC degeneration. We tested whether HDAP2, a novel high-density aromatic peptide that binds cardiolipin to stabilize mitochondrial membranes, can protect RGCs in the DBA/2J mouse model. Methods: DBA/2J mice received HDAP2 (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, every other day) starting at 4 months of age for 8 months. IOP was measured each month to track pressure exposure. RGC survival was assessed by counting RBPMS-stained cells in retinal wholemounts and optic nerve axons in semithin toludine blue-stained sections. Results: HDAP2-treated retinas had about 49% more RGCs than untreated retinas at similar pressure exposures (p = 0.0063; F(2,59) = 5.524). At mild IOP exposure, HDAP2 preserved 58% more RGCs compared with untreated retinas, and at high IOPs, RGC survival was 180% greater. Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that HDAP2 increased the threshold for severe RGC loss by 29 mmHg and reduced the chance of developing severe RGC degeneration by a factor of 4.6. Optic nerve axons from treated retinas were also well preserved, with axon morphologies appearing indistinguishable from controls. Axon size distributions did not change significantly among the treatment groups, suggesting that protection by HDAP2 was similar among RGC subtypes. Conclusions: HDAP2 preserved both RGCs and axons in a pressure-dependent manner and increased tolerance to IOP. These results suggest that HDAP2 may complement pressure-lowering therapy, including for normal-tension and treatment-refractory glaucoma.",

      "title": "Multimodal Characterization and Evolution of Malonate-induced Stroke Model: advanced MRI, Histology-Molecular Profiling",
      "content": "Background: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, yet therapeutic options remain limited. Preclinical models play a crucial role in understanding stroke pathophysiology and evaluating potential treatments. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the temporal evolution of ischemic injury induced by malonate intracerebral injection using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with histological and molecular analysis. Methods: Focal ischemic lesions were induced by malonate injection in the striatum of rats. Lesion volume was monitored using T2-weighted MRI at multiple time points (Day 1, D7, D14, D28, and D56). Water content, reflecting vasogenic edema, was assessed via apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements, while vascular alterations were evaluated using blood volume fraction (BVF), vessel radius, and oxygen saturation (StO2). Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was quantified through gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Molecular analyses by RT-qPCR were conducted to assess oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis-related gene expression. Immunohistological staining was performed to investigate neuronal loss, astrocytic activation, and vascular remodeling. Results: MRI analysis showed a significant and progressive decrease in lesion volume. Water content increased from D4 onward. Ischemic injury significantly altered vascular function, leading to increased vessel radius and BVF while reducing tissue oxygenation. BBB permeability was elevated at D7 and D56, accompanied by increased claudin-1 and aquaporin-1 expression. Molecular analysis revealed an upregulation of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TGF-{beta}, NF-{kappa}B), oxidative stress response genes (SOD1, Nrf1), and impaired angiogenesis with increased Ang1/Ang2 but reduced VEGF/VEGFR1. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated neuronal loss, astrocytic activation, and vascular remodeling, characterized by increased ZO-1 and ColI-IV expression. Conclusion: The observed changes in lesion volume, vascular function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis highlight key mechanisms underlying post-stroke recovery. These findings emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring in preclinical stroke models and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",
