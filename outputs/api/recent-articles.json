      "title": "Dynamic methylation changes in Alzheimers disease-related genes during mindfulness practice - a proof-of-concept study",
      "content": "Background: Mindfulness meditation has gained significant attention in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its potential effects on the prevention of cognitive decline and overall psychological well-being. The epigenetic landscape of this complex neurodegenerative disorder can be influenced by environmental factors. Mindfulness practices could actively shape the biological response to AD by modifying the underlying molecular mechanisms through epigenetic regulation. Methods: A group of 17 long-term mindfulness meditators (MMs) and 17 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Experienced MMs participated in a 1-month Vipassana meditation retreat. Blood DNA methylation levels of differentially methylated genes (ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3, NXN, TREM2 and TREML2) previously validated in a predictive AD-model found analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: An increase in DNA methylation was observed for ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3 and TREM2 in MMs with respect to controls. Furthermore, significant differences were found for ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE and HOXA3 in MMs after retreat. Conclusions: DNA methylation changes identified for ADAM10 and HOXA3 in MMs are in the opposite direction to those occurring in AD and may constitute a protective epigenetic alteration. Mindfulness practice could counteract DNA methylation of key AD genes as a possible preventive strategy or non-pharmacological intervention in AD patients.",

      "title": "Comparative Analysis of FOXP2 Expression in the Thalamus of Mice, Rats, and Macaques: Implications for the Evolution of Language Circuits.",
      "content": "FOXP2 is a transcription factor essential for the development and function of neural circuits involved in language. Although its expression has been extensively characterized in the cortex and basal ganglia, its organization within the adult thalamus remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of FoxP2 protein expression across thalamic nuclei in mice, rats, and macaques, with a focus on nuclei associated with higher-order cognitive functions and language-related circuits in humans. We found that FoxP2 is expressed in most thalamic nuclei across species, with a consistent absence in the reticular nucleus and zona incerta. Expression was highest in midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas the anterior group showed low and variable expression among species. Macaques exhibited broader and, in some nuclei, more intense FoxP2 expression, particularly in associative regions such as the pulvinar, lateral geniculate, and parts of the ventral group, indicating increased specialization of thalamocortical pathways. This distribution suggests a conserved role for FoxP2 in shaping thalamic circuits supporting sensorimotor integration, attention, memory, and linguistic processing. Phylogenetic comparisons further indicate that enhanced FoxP2 expression in associative thalamic territories in primates, likely intensified in humans, may have contributed to the evolution of neural circuits required for speech and language. These findings provide molecular and anatomical insights into how FoxP2 helps organize thalamocortical networks relevant both to language function and to neuropsychiatric disorders involving thalamocortical dysconnectivity.",

      "title": "WWOX deficiency uncovers a cell-autonomous mechanism impairing myelin repair",
      "content": "Remyelination is essential for neuronal function and plasticity, and its failure contributes to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, the molecular programs governing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a critical cell-autonomous regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair. Reanalysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing from MS lesions revealed WWOX as one of the most significantly dysregulated oligodendroglial genes. Conditional deletion of Wwox in oligodendroglia impaired OPC differentiation, favouring aberrant proliferation and blocking myelin regeneration after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Single-nucleus transcriptomics confirmed profound transcriptional reprogramming in WWOX-deficient oligodendroglia during remyelination, with enrichment of WNT and TGFb; signalling and cell cycle programs. Mechanistically, WWOX physically interacts with the master transcription factor SOX10 via its WW1 domain, stabilising SOX10 protein and sustaining its downstream myelin gene network. Loss of WWOX reduced SOX10 stability and activity, providing a direct mechanistic link to defective OPC differentiation. Together, our findings uncover WWOX as an essential orchestrator of remyelination and position the WWOX-SOX10 axis as a promising therapeutic target for enhancing myelin repair in MS and related demyelinating disorders.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Paul. I\u2019m building Syd, an offline-first forensic workstation that orchestrates tools like YARA and Nmap through a GUI, using a local LLM to analyze the results without leaking data. It runs completely offline on localhost\u2014no data is ever sent to the cloud, making it safe for sensitive investigations.<p>Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dQV3JbLrRE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dQV3JbLrRE</a>.<p>I built this because while tools like YARA are powerful, managing rule sets and decoding hex strings is slow. AI is great at explaining malware signatures, but I couldn't use ChatGPT for my work because pasting potential malware or sensitive logs into a web form is a massive security risk. I needed the intelligence of an LLM but with the privacy of an air-gapped machine.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built on Python 3. I use subprocess to manage the heavy lifting of the scanning engines so the UI (built with CustomTkinter) doesn't freeze. The \"secret sauce\" isn't the AI itself, but the parser I wrote that converts the unstructured text output from YARA into a structured JSON format that the local LLM can actually understand and reason about.<p>I\u2019ve been using it to triage files for my own learning. In one case, Syd flagged a file matching a \"SilentBanker\" rule and the AI pointed out specific API calls for keylogging, saving me about 20 minutes of manual hex-editing. In the demo video linked, you can see this workflow: scanning a directory, hitting on a custom YARA rule, and having the local AI immediately analyze the strings.<p>Through this process, I learned that \"AI wrappers\" are easy, but AI orchestration is hard\u2014getting the tools to output clean data for the LLM is the real challenge. I'd love to hear if there are other static analysis tools (like PEStudio or Capa) you consider essential for a workstation like this, or how you currently handle the privacy risk of using AI for log analysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46031208\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46031208</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways",
      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "Structural connectome gradients and their relationship to IQ in childhood",
      "content": "The concept of connectome gradients, which represents the continuous spatial variation of brain connectivity, offers a robust framework for exploring the hierarchical organization of the cortex and its relationship with cognitive function. We hypothesize that structural gradients in frontal and parietal regions play a significant role in shaping individual cognitive abilities during early childhood. To evaluate this hypothesis, we identified macroscale structural connectome gradients in children aged 1\u20136 years, where the principal gradient exhibited a left-to-right axis, and the secondary gradient exhibited an anterior-to-posterior axis. Next, we employed machine learning approaches to predict the future cognitive outcomes assessed at ages 4, 6, and 8, specifically intelligence quotient (IQ), based on the structural connectome gradients measured at age 1. We achieved consistent and robust prediction results (mean Spearman's correlation > 0.25). The regional relevance maps highlighted regions in control network, and associated sensory processing networks. Our findings indicate that the structural connectome, which undergoes maturation during early childhood, plays a crucial role in the individual variability of IQ observed in early and middle childhood. Our approach underscores the utility of structural gradients as compact and interpretable representations of the brain's complex network architecture, effectively capturing individual differences that contribute to cognitive development.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "TCPL: task-conditioned prompt learning for few-shot cross-subject motor imagery EEG decoding",
      "content": "Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding plays a critical role in brain\u2013computer interfaces but remains challenging due to large inter-subject variability and limited training data. Existing approaches often struggle with few-shot cross-subject adaptation, as they require either extensive fine-tuning or fail to capture individualized neural dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a Task-Conditioned Prompt Learning (TCPL), which integrates a Task-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module with a hybrid Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Transformer backbone under a meta-learning framework. Specifically, TCP encodes subject-specific variability as prompt tokens, TCN extracts local temporal patterns, Transformer captures global dependencies, and meta-learning enables rapid adaptation with minimal samples. The proposed TCPL model is validated on three widely used public datasets, GigaScience, Physionet, and BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating strong generalization and efficient adaptation across unseen subjects. These results highlight the feasibility of TCPL for practical few-shot EEG decoding and its potential to advance the development of personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

      "title": "Emerging technologies and neuroscience-based approaches in dyslexia: a narrative review toward integrative and personalized solutions",
      "content": "BackgroundDevelopmental dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs reading ability despite adequate intelligence and education, affecting up to 17% of children worldwide. Advances in neuroscience have revealed complex mechanisms involving phonological, visual, and temporal processing, with cross-linguistic variability. At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",
