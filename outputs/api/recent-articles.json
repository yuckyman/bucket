      "title": "A neuroendocrine principle: Pancreatic islets actively shape sympathetic innervation",
      "content": "Survival critically depends on maintaining blood glucose to provide essential energy, especially during emergencies such as the fight-or-flight response, when timely glucose control via neural integration is vital. However, pancreatic islets constitute only a small fraction of the pancreas and are dispersed throughout the organ, raising the fundamental question of how the nervous system coordinates synchronized control of multiple islets. Using whole-organ clearing and 3D imaging, we mapped pancreatic sympathetic innervation, revealing specialized anatomical integration between sympathetic nerves and islets. Transplanted islets intrinsically attracted sympathetic nerves independent of their native environment. Chronic islet injury disrupted sympathetic innervation and impaired nerve regeneration after denervation. Sympathetic denervation markedly elevated islet-derived Reg2 and Reg3{beta}; administration of these proteins accelerated sympathetic regeneration and improved islet graft function. Our findings identify an islet-sympathetic architecture actively maintained by islets, uncovering an endocrine-driven mechanism for neural regulation, highlighting Reg2 and Reg3{beta} as therapeutic candidates for diabetes management.",

      "title": "TDP-43 loss of function drives aberrant splicing in Parkinson's disease",
      "content": "While mRNA splicing dysregulation is a well-established contributor to neurodegeneration in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains underexplored. Here, we analyse transcriptomic data from >500 post-mortem human brain samples from individuals with and without PD to show that splicing alterations are frequently detected. Differentially spliced genes were significantly more enriched for those causally-implicated in both PD and ALS than genes that were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between these splicing alterations and dysfunction of the RNA-binding protein (RBP), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Strikingly, genes and exon junctions affected by TDP-43 knockdown overlapped significantly with those dysregulated across brain regions in PD. In brains from individuals with the LRRK2 c.6055G>A (p.G2019S) mutation, the most common genetic cause of PD, we also observed significant enrichment of TDP-43-dependent splicing changes. This finding was corroborated in human pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a LRRK2 p.G2019S knock-in mouse model, where reduced nuclear TDP-43 levels evidenced the well-recognised loss-of-function mechanism contributing to splicing dysregulation. By leveraging our RNA-based analyses we predicted TDP-43-dependent novel peptide sequences and validated their existence within human LRRK2 mutation mDNs, while also demonstrating an overall loss of protein and mRNA expression in mis-spliced genes. Collectively, our findings reveal that PD is marked by extensive splicing dysregulation dependent on TDP-43, making TDP-43 a promising new therapeutic target in PD.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
