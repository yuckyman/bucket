      "title": "Peripheral regeneration of A\u03b2 low-threshold mechanoreceptors is limited despite activation of regenerative transcriptional pathways",
      "content": "Peripheral neurons can regenerate after nerve injury, yet functional recovery is often incomplete due to non-specific or incomplete target reinnervation. Among sensory neuron subtypes, A{beta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{beta}-LTMRs) mediate discriminative touch, a modality often incompletely restored after nerve injury. However, the mechanisms governing A{beta}-LTMR regeneration remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterised the anatomical and transcriptional features of A{beta}-LTMRs regeneration after nerve injury. We assessed the extent of axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush and the preferential regeneration following femoral nerve transection using Calb1-Cre/tdTomato reporter mice. In both models, regeneration was incomplete, failing to reach control values. Moreover, A{beta}-LTMRs preferentially reinnervated cutaneous rather than muscle pathways. To define the molecular program underlying this response, we performed ribosome-bound RNA sequencing from Calb1-Cre/Ribotag mice 7 days after nerve crush. A{beta}-LTMRs upregulated canonical regeneration-associated genes, including Atf3, Sprr1a, Gal, and Gap43. Comparison with published RNA-seq datasets from other sensory neuron populations revealed only modest overlap, indicating that the core injury response shared between neurons is accompanied by a neuron subtype-specific programme. Together, these findings define the regenerative profile of A{beta}-LTMRs across anatomical and transcriptomic levels, revealing the limited regenerative capacity of this neuron subpopulation despite robust activation of classical regeneration-associated genes.",

      "title": "Elevated neuronal TAF15 expression leads to FTD-like phenotype",
      "content": "TAF15, a DNA/RNA-binding protein whose dysfunction in alternative splicing impairs NMDA receptor signaling, can form amyloid fibrils that contribute to neurodegeneration in the neurodegenerative diseases like FTD and ALS, indicating a close involvement of TAF15 in both neuronal physiological function and activation of pathological pathways. However, the relationship between TAF15 expression levels and neurodegeneration, as well as the specific downstream pathways mediating its neurotoxicity, remains unclear. Here, we found a consistent upregulation of TAF15 in prefrontal cortex neurons from patients across multiple FTD and ALS subtypes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that neuronal TAF15 overexpression triggered oxidative stress, evidenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to neurotoxicity and gliosis. Mice overexpressing TAF15 in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons exhibited heightened anxiety and impaired fear memory, mimicking some key features of FTD behavioral abnormalities. Notably, these pathological and behavioral phenotypes are rescued by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), indicating that elevated TAF15 level exacerbates neurodegeneration primarily by activating oxidative stress pathways. Together, this work elucidates a novel TAF15-oxidative stress axis in FTD-associated neurodegeneration, providing a conceptual framework for future therapeutic development.",

      "title": "Cognitive and autonomic physiological responses to daily transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in healthy adults",
      "content": "Introduction: The vagus nerve regulates autonomic processes central to cognition. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can acutely modulate executive function in healthy adults, but the effects of repeated dosing, roles of executive subdomains, and importance of sex as a biological variable require clarification. Method: In a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study, 12 healthy adults (six women) received 10 consecutive days of left monoaural taVNS (VNS) or sham (CON), with a two-week follow-up rechallenge. Stimulation (100Hz; 200us pulse width) was delivered continuously (online) at rest and during the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition), Wisconsin Card Sorting (shifting), and Sternberg (working memory) tasks. Resting autonomic measures included pupil diameter, skin conductance (SCL), mean R-R interval (mRR), respiration, and blood pressure. Primary outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed models and Sidak-corrected contrasts. Results: Ten days of taVNS produced immediate and cumulative changes in multiple executive function subdomains that remained evident at rechallenge, with the strongest effects on accuracy. Across tasks, benefits were most pronounced in women; men displayed initial performance costs, but with greater longitudinal improvements. Cognitive effects were most evident on higher-difficulty trials. Autonomically, taVNS increased SCL during and after stimulation, amplified stimulus- and task-evoked pupil responses, and transiently lengthened mRR. Stimulation was well tolerated and blinding was acceptable. Conclusions: Resolution of taVNS effects to higher-difficulty trials supports adaptive-gain modulation within executive function networks. The combination of larger evoked pupil/SCR, transient mRR lengthening, and increased SCL indicates that taVNS increased autonomic flexibility and arousal. Our findings identify biological sex and stimulation intensity as potentially important considerations for taVNS efficacy and provide longitudinal estimates to guide dosing, biomarker selection, and trial design. Collectively, the results support continued development of taVNS as a safe tool for the modulation of executive function and autonomic activity in healthy adults.",

      "title": "Parallel neuronal ensembles control behavior across sensorimotor levels in Drosophila",
      "content": "Nervous systems can process information in serial or in parallel, trading off efficiency for flexibility and speed. How these network architectures are implemented across sensorimotor pathways to control behavior is unclear. We investigate this tradeoff directly in Drosophila by comparing neuronal circuits underlying landing and takeoff, behaviors transforming similar visual cues to whole-body motor output. Using a whole-CNS connectome, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we reconstruct the complete feedforward pathway for landing, including visual feature detectors, a dedicated ensemble of descending neurons (DNs), and a core premotor circuit in the nerve cord. Comparison to the takeoff pathway reveals that, despite encoding the same sensory feature and engaging similar muscle groups, neuronal circuits controlling the two behaviors are separated at every sensorimotor level. Extending this analysis to the complete DN population reveals a blueprint for descending motor control: DNs across the behavioral space utilized by the fly are organized as a set of parallel, loosely-overlapping ensembles that form a continuum from command-like control, with individual DNs determining behavioral output, to population coding, with multiple DNs controlling behavior synergistically. Distinct combinations of sensory feature detectors differentially recruit DN ensembles to enable flexible, context-dependent behavioral control.",

      "content": "Proteostasis dysfunction is a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the genetic and molecular pathways that disrupt protein homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated human genetics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to identify proteostasis network components involved in tauopathy. We identified 18 proteostasis network genes harboring 75 rare, damaging variants enriched in FTD and/or AD. These genes, spanning multiple proteostasis pathways, were differentially expressed in MAPT mutant neurons and dysregulated in FTD and AD brains. NINL, which encodes Nlp, emerged as the only gene consistently upregulated across all datasets. NINL overexpression reduced tau seeding and enhanced lysosomal proteolytic activity, whereas two FTD-enriched NINL frameshift variants impaired Nlp expression and abolished these protective effects. Together, our findings identify a set of proteostasis genes with genetic and transcriptional links to neurodegeneration and reveal NINL as a novel regulator of tau aggregation, potentially upregulated as an adaptive response to proteotoxic stress.",

      "content": "IntroductionMotor imagery (MI) classification and sleep apnea (SA) detection are two critical tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) and biomedical signal analysis. Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

      "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",
