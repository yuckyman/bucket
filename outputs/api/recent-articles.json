I wanted to share this with the community because it solves a pain point many of us have had with legacy PDF libraries: manual coordinate-based coding.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>GoPdfSuit is a high-performance PDF generation engine that allows you to design layouts visually and generate documents via a simple Python API.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Editor:</strong> Includes a React-based UI to design your PDF. It exports a JSON template, so you never have to manually calculate <code>x,y</code> coordinates again.</li> <li><strong>Python Integration:</strong> You interact with the engine purely via standard Python <code>requests</code> (HTTP/JSON). You deploy the container/binary once and just hit the endpoint from your Python scripts.</li> <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Supports Arlington Compatibility, PDF/UA-2 (Accessibility), and PDF/A (Archival) out of the box.</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is built for <strong>Production Use</strong>. It is specifically designed for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Developers</strong> who need to generate complex reports (invoices, financial statements) but find existing libraries slow or hard to maintain.</li> <li><strong>Enterprise Teams</strong> requiring strict PDF compliance (accessibility and archival standards).</li> <li><strong>High-Volume Apps</strong> where PDF generation is a bottleneck (e.g., generating 1,000+ PDFs per minute).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why this matters for Python devs:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Insane Performance:</strong> The heavy lifting is done in Go, keeping generation lightning fast. <ul> <li><strong>Engine Generation:</strong> ~61ms</li> <li><strong>Total Python Execution:</strong> ~73ms</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>No Go Required:</strong> You interact with the engine purely via standard Python requests (HTTP/JSON). You just deploy the container/binary and hit the endpoint.</li> <li><strong>Modern Editor:</strong> Includes a React-based UI to visually drag-and-drop your layout. It exports a JSON template that your Python script fills with data.</li> <li><strong>Strict Compliance:</strong> Out-of-the-box support for Arlington Compatibility, PDF/UA-2 (Accessibility), and PDF/A (Archival).</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison (How it differs from ReportLab/JasperReports)</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\"><strong>Feature</strong></th> <th align=\"left\"><strong>ReportLab / JasperReports</strong></th> <th align=\"left\"><strong>GoPdfSuit</strong></th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Layout Design</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Manual code / XML</td> <td align=\"left\">Visual Drag-and-Drop</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Performance</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Python-level speed / Heavy Java</td> <td align=\"left\">Native Go speed (~70ms execution)</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Maintenance</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Changing a layout requires code edits</td> <td align=\"left\">Change the JSON template; no code changes</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Compliance</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Requires extra plugins/config</td> <td align=\"left\">Built-in PDF/UA and PDF/A support</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1>Performance Benchmarks</h1> <p>Tested on a standard financial report template including XMP data, image processing, and bookmarks:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Go Engine Internal Logic:</strong> ~61.53ms</li> <li><strong>Total Python Execution (Network + API):</strong> ~73.08ms</li> </ul> <h1>Links &amp; Resources</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Repository:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit\">github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit</a></li> <li><strong>Python Integration Examples:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit/tree/master/sampledata/python\">Python Examples Folder</a></li> <li><strong>Validation:</strong> You can validate the output using <strong>OctoPDF</strong> or <strong>veraPDF</strong> to confirm compliance.</li> </ul> <p>If you find this useful, a <strong>Star</strong> on GitHub is much appreciated!

      "title": "Csf1r-mediated depletion of midbrain microglia prevents dopaminergic neuron loss during chronic colitis",
      "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predisposes to neuropsychiatric comorbidity and particularly increases the risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in later life. Although the gut-immune-brain axis was proposed as a link between IBD and PD and a driver of PD immunopathogenesis, the regional pattern and single-cell landscape of the brain immune response during colitis and its contribution to PD pathology remain poorly defined. Here, we observe a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of adult mice with chronic colitis. By confocal microscopy and integrated multi-omics, we reveal a complex midbrain-centered immune response to chronic colitis in comparison to the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Single-cell mapping of the midbrain immune landscape showed an inflammatory shift of microglial clusters including an expansion of interferon-response microglia, CD8+ T cell extravasation, and increased numbers of vessel-associated neutrophils. Selective myeloid cell depletion using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) inhibitor after colitis onset reduced midbrain microglia by 67% and led to a complete rescue of dopaminergic neuron loss, without affecting mucosal pathology or T cell and neutrophil migration to the midbrain. Collectively, within the complex innate and adaptive midbrain immune response to chronic colitis, we demonstrate a causal role of Csf1r-dependent microglia for dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Thus, Csf1r inhibition in IBD may not locally ameliorate colitis, but provide neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons. These results reveal a novel cellular link between chronic gut-derived peripheral inflammation and midbrain vulnerability and thereby substantially enhance our understanding of the risk for PD related to the gut-immune-brain axis.",

      "title": "Can category-selective cortex predict categorisation behaviour?",
      "content": "One of the distinctive features of the human visual system is the presence in occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) of regions that show preferential activation to specific categories of visual objects. To understand how this selectivity relates to categorisation behaviour, studies have employed a distance-to-bound approach (DTB), where multivariate brain activity is used to estimate a decision boundary, from which behavioural performance can be predicted. Using this approach, correlations have been found between activity in OTC, and behavioural performance when carrying out certain categorisation tasks. However, it remains unclear what determines where in OTC this correlations can be found, and with which categorisation tasks they can be found. Here, we bridged this gap by relating category selective regions of OTC, to behavioural performance while participants categorised images as belonging or not to their preferred categories. We adopted a more basic approach and considered simple, univariate activity, rather than relying on decoding to build our DTB. Our results show that activation in regions selective to faces (FFA & OFA), bodies (EBA), and scenes (PPA), is sufficient to predict behavioural performance while categorising images as being faces, bodies, or scenes, respectively. These results are largely consistent across reaction time and motor movements, and generalise to animacy classification. Overall, our data adds to evidence that category-selective regions in OTC can serve to guide categorisation behaviour, and underlines the validity of the DTB approach to address this relationship.",
