      "title": "High-resolution MRI Guided Whole Mouse Brain Cell Type Atlas using Deep Learning",
      "content": "Cell types represent groupings of cells defined by shared anatomical and functional properties. Traditional mouse brain cell atlases rely heavily on single-cell sequencing, which provides valuable molecular detail but lacks whole-brain, isotropic resolution. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) offers a complementary approach for probing cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture, with quantitative metrics increasingly used as biomarkers of brain development and neurodegenerative disorders. Although prior work has linked dMRI metrics with gene expression, the capacity of dMRI to directly predict cell types remains unclear. Here, we present a deep learning framework that integrates high-resolution dMRI with three-dimensional light-sheet microscopy (LSM) registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3). We investigated correlations between dMRI and spatial transcriptomics-derived cell types and generated a whole-brain cell type atlas at 10 micrometer isotropic resolution. Together, these results establish an efficient, high-resolution strategy for brain cell atlas generation and underscore the potential of advanced imaging to illuminate cellular mechanisms of the brain.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "content": "Micro-satellite repeat expansion of the 5' GGGGCC 3' sequence in the C9orf72 gene is the most common monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from the mutant allele can be detected in postmortem brains of afflicted individuals. The arginine containing peptides, poly-PR and poly-GR, are particularly noxious to cells. Both have been shown to undergo cell-cell transmission, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We found rapid internalization and nucleolar localization of bath-applied hemagglutinin (HA) tagged poly-PR with twenty repeats (HA-PR20) in cell lines and neurons. Small molecule and RNAi approaches implicated a temperature-dependent, fluid phase endocytosis mechanism in HA-PR20 uptake. We sought to identify DPR-related cell surface uptake factors using a high-resolution proximity labeling technique developed in the MacMillan group, termed Map. DPR-iridium conjugates identified candidate cell-surface proteins which were interrogated in an RNAi screen. Focusing on our strongest candidate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), we showed that cellular uptake of HA-PR20 is blocked by inhibition of glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis (using drugs or RNAi) and knockdown or ablation of CSPG4 (using RNAi or CRISPR editing). Reduction of CSPG4 protected PR20-induced neuronal toxicity. We used a dual reporter system to interrogate in vitro neuron-to-neuron transmission of PR50 and found that PR50 synthesized by one neuron readily spread to neighboring neurons. Transmission was significantly reduced when CSPG4 was knocked down. These results suggest CSPG4 is an important factor in poly-PR internalization and transmission and therefore may be a therapeutic target to slow DPR transmission and disease progression.",

      "title": "The fat-body secreted neuropeptide CCHa2 signals insulin-producing cells in the brain to promote sleep",
      "content": "Sleep is a fundamental behavior regulated by diverse environmental and physiological cues. While the central mechanisms underlying sleep regulation have been investigated in detail, far less is known about how nutrient signals from the periphery are communicated to the brain to modulate sleep. Here, we perform a targeted RNAi screen of genes enriched in the fat body and regulated by feeding state to identify genes that function in the fat body to regulate sleep in Drosophila. This analysis found that body-specific knockdown of CCHa2 significantly reduced sleep duration and sleep depth in fed flies, phenocopying sleep in starved flies. CCHa2-deficient flies exhibited reduced glycogen stores and diminished feeding drive. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomic atlases confirms that the CCHa2 receptor (CCHa2-R) is selectively expressed in Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs) of the fly brain. We find that knockdown of CCHa2-R in IPCs recapitulates the sleep loss phenotype of CCHa2 mutants, supporting a role in adipose-brain signaling. Further screening of genes identified in single cell atlases as being enriched in IPCs led to the identification of numerous genes that function in IPCs to regulate sleep including modulators of wnt and insulin signaling. Together, these findings identify a fat body-IPC axis that is a critical modulator of sleep duration and intensity.",
