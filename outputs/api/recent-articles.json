      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with Django for a long time, and I love it's philosophy, the structure, the CLI, and how easy it is to spin up new apps.</p> <p>When I started using FastAPI, I loved the performance and simplicity, but I often find myself spending a lot of time just setting up the architecture.</p> <p>I decided to build a boilerplate for FastAPI + SQLAlchemy to bridge that gap. I call it <strong>Djast</strong>.</p> <p><strong>What is Djast</strong> Djast is essentially <strong>FastAPI + SQLAlchemy</strong>, but organized like a Django project. It is <strong>not</strong> a wrapper that hides FastAPI\u2019s internal logic. It\u2019s a project template designed to help you hit the ground running without reinventing the architecture every time.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Django-style CLI:</strong> It includes a <code>manage.py</code> that handles commands like <code>startapp</code> (to create modular apps), <code>makemigrations</code>, <code>migrate</code>, and <code>shell</code>.</li> <li><strong>Smart Migrations:</strong> It wraps Alembic to mimic the Django workflow (<code>makemigrations</code> / <code>migrate</code>). It even detects table/column renames interactively so you don't lose data, and warns you about dangerous operations.</li> <li><strong>Familiar ORM Wrapper:</strong> It uses standard async SQLAlchemy, but includes a helper to provide a Django-like syntax for common queries (e.g., <code>await Item.objects(session).get(id=1)</code>).</li> <li><strong>Pydantic Integration:</strong> A helper method to generate Pydantic schemas directly from your DB models (similar to <code>ModelForm</code> concepts) helps to keep your code DRY.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Shell:</strong> A pre-configured IPython shell that auto-imports your models and handles the async session for you.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> This is for Django developers who want to try FastAPI but feel &quot;homesick&quot; for the Django structure and awesome quality-of-life features, or for FastAPI developers who want a more opinionated, battle-tested project layout.</p> <p>I decided to share it in hope that this is as usefull to you as it is to me. I would also appreciate some feedback. If you have time to check it out, I\u2019d love to hear what you think about the structure or if there are features you think are missing.</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast</a> <strong>Quickstart:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md\">https://github.com/AGTGreg/Djast/blob/master/quickstart.md</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgtGreg\"> /u/AgtGreg </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9pvlk/i_built_a_djangostyle_boilerplate_for_fastapi/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.",

      "title": "High-Frequency Activity Encodes the Temporal Dynamics of Hierarchical Prediction Errors in Humans: An Electrocorticography Study",
      "content": "Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.",

      "title": "Top-down feedback can explain the existence of working memory traces in early visual cortex",
      "content": "The temporary storage of visual memories is known to engage early visual cortex (EVC), where mnemonic content is presumed to be stored in weak or latent states. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this storage: Top-down feedback from anterior cortical sites, and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) traces laid down by previous sensory inputs. Here, we tested if these mechanisms can account for two hallmarks of working memory, namely, the flexible selection of information from working memory, and the robustness of working memory against distraction. Simulating firing rates in a neural network model of working memory, we show that STSP cannot easily account for selection of information from within the working memory store, and is not robust to visual distraction. Rather, any input that passes through the visual system is briefly remembered, irrespective of its relevance. In contrast, top-down feedback can establish durable mnemonic signals in EVC that reflect currently task-relevant working memory contents and are robust to distraction. We argue that feedback is a parsimonious explanation for the existence of mnemonic signals in EVC, given that the storage of working memories is distributed across a hierarchy of cortical sites, which are known to have widespread feedback projections to visual cortex.",

      "title": "Predicting functional topography of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy at scale",
      "content": "Topographic organization is a fundamental principle of the brain, whereby adjacent cortical locations represent adjacent features in sensory or cognitive space. Current methodologies for obtaining individual-specific topographic maps either require resource-intensive functional neuroimaging data or, when using population atlases, lack precision for individual-level inference, limiting large-scale studies of individual differences. Here, we developed deepRetinotopy toolbox, a deep learning-based application for predicting topographic organization of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy. We show that our toolbox accurately predicts retinotopic organization using only standard structural MRI scans acquired under diverse conditions, including varying imaging sites and scanner types. We then demonstrate that predicted maps can be leveraged to automatically generate individual-specific visual area boundaries, overcoming common biases in manual annotations. Finally, we estimate age-related changes in visual cortex organization by retrospectively applying our method to 11,060 anatomical scans, revealing that group differences in primary visual cortex organization are predictable from cortical anatomy.",
