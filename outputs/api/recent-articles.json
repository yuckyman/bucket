      "title": "DREADD agonist Clozapine-N-oxide, but not Compound 21, impairs spatial memory encoding",
      "content": "Chemogenetic studies using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) enable the precise manipulation of neuronal activity in specific brain regions and cell types. DREADDs are widely used to dissect neural circuits underlying animal behavior, including learning and memory. Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO), a metabolite of clozapine and one of the earliest-developed ligands for muscarinic DREADDs, was initially considered pharmacologically inert. However, CNO is now known to undergo back-metabolism to clozapine, leading to undesired off-target behavioral effects, including alterations in locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors. New ligands such as Compound 21 (C21) have been developed to improve selectivity and reduce these effects. However, despite their widespread use, no studies to date have directly compared the effects of CNO and C21 themselves on specific cognitive processes such as hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Here, we measured acute effects of CNO and C21 on spatial memory encoding, using an object-location memory (OLM) paradigm in male and female mice. We also quantified encoding-associated hippocampal principal neuron and parvalbumin (PV+) interneuron activity by measuring cFos expression in these populations. Across dorsal hippocampal subregions, neither ligand altered overall neuronal activity nor PV+ interneuron activity during encoding. Nonetheless, we find that CNO administration impairs OLM encoding, while C21 does not. Together, these findings highlight a previously unrecognized behavioral effect of CNO administration on hippocampus-dependent memory formation - even in the absence of DREADD expression - and indicate that C21 may be a preferable ligand for chemogenetic studies examining memory and hippocampal function.",

      "title": "Boundary Vector Cells Encode a Future-Biased Spectrum of Positions in the Rat",
      "content": "Spatial tuning is a hallmark property of neural firing in the hippocampal formation. Yet, that tuning is often less well correlated with the instantaneous current position of an animal than it is with an integrated version of the past or future state of the animal. Whether that encoding is biased towards past or future states and the extent to which it shows fixed versus multi-scale encoding varies across circuits and cell types. The temporal encoding properties of boundary vector cells of the subiculum are not well established. To address this here, we re-analyzed recordings of BVCs described previously by Lever et al. (2009) with multiple approaches. In the first, we asked if adding a temporal offset between the rat position and the spiking of a BVC increased the apparent spatial tuning in the firing rate map. We found that aligning BVC spiking with future states maximized the rate map spatial tuning. These results were mirrored in a second analysis that, instead of optimizing rate map spatial tuning, optimized how well the firing rate map predicted the BVC spiking. The second analysis also allowed us to ask whether that encoding is focused on a particular temporal horizon or whether the encoding captures behavior at multiple scales. To this end, for a given recording, we asked ``How much time-integration of the behavioral state is the observed spiking most consistent with?'' We observed a wide spectrum of time-constants of integration across cells, indicating that BVCs form a multiscale encoding of future states. The distribution of both offsets and integration rates observed across BVCs did not differ significantly from other, non-BVC, subiculum neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that BVCs, along with other subiculum neurons, form a multi-scale encoding of future states.",

      "title": "Inflammatory signaling differentially changes chromatin accessibility and gene expression of the PD- associated kinase LRRK2 between human and mice",
      "content": "The genomic locus that encodes the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is highly pleiotropic, being associated with both Parkinsons disease (PD) and Crohns disease (CD). Coding variants associated with risk of PD and CD act as gain of function kinase mutations increasing phosphorylation of RAB substrates, and non-coding variants in the promoter region of LRRK2 increase expression of the gene, notably in immune cells. If regulation of LRRK2 expression is a causal contributor to age-related diseases, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) by which LRRK2 is regulated, particularly in the context of inflammation. Here, we show that interferon-gamma exposure induces robust LRRK2 activation in human iPSC derived microglia through signaling of the Janus-activated Kinase complex to phosphorylate STAT1, which then binds to the LRRK2 promoter and is associated with remodeling of chromatin structure in this genomic locus. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the stress-induced transcription factor and long non-coding RNA encoded at the same locus, resulting in increased LRRK2 mRNA levels. We also show evidence of the same effect in acutely cultured human brain slices. While we were unable to demonstrate any induction of Lrrk2 mRNA in the mouse brain, the introduction of a human bacterial artificial chromosome transgene into the mouse genome recapitulated sensitivity to interferon-gamma in microglia. A comparative genomic analysis across mammals suggests that these species differences are driven by regulatory regions upstream of LRRK2 that are specific to anthropoid primates. These results demonstrate that there are differences between species in how genes associated with human diseases are regulated and provide important information that should be incorporated in disease modeling.",

      "title": "Location and mapping of the human rostromedial tegmental nucleus and associated midbrain inhibitory nuclei regulating dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Background: Animal experiments reveal distinct GABAergic cell clusters within the dopaminergic midbrain regions in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and retrorubral fields (RRF) that have yet to be clearly defined in humans. These neurons send prominent inhibitory projections to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that impact motor, reward and threat processing. Objective: To identify GABergic RMTg and RRF cell clusters in the human brain. Methods: Ten m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transverse human brainstem sections from ten control cases were obtained from the Sydney Brain Bank and immunohistochemistry for GABA and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to determine the location and cell size of RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons. These cell populations were further mapped in transverse 50m thick cresyl violet stained serial midbrain sections (every 750m) from previously published controls (Halliday et al. 1990a). Results: GABAergic neurons were cytoarchitecturally distinct, with the largest GABAergic neurons in the RRF, followed by RMTg neurons which were larger than GABAergic neurons in the interpedunclular nucleus (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons first appear in caudal transverse midbrain sections approximately 38mm above the obex. RMTg moves rostrally and medially from underneath the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle to just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. The RRF cluster also moves rostrally and medially to the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP) just under the red nucleus. Conclusion: The GABAergic neurons in RMTg and RRF/PBP that modulate dopamine neuronal excitability have distinct morphologies in humans. Identifying these inhibitory neurons is key to evaluating their role in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Loss of contractile pericytes and their impaired calcium dynamics exacerbate brain ischemic stroke of awake mice in acute and chronic phases",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke frequently results in persistent neurovascular uncoupling, whereby neuronal activity fails to evoke appropriate microvascular responses despite restoration of upstream blood flow. The cellular mechanisms governing this dysfunction along the arteriolar-capillary continuum remain poorly understood. Using two-photon microscopy and laser speckle imaging in awake Acta2-GCaMP8 mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we examined calcium signaling and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells, precapillary sphincters (PS), and contractile pericytes during stroke progression. During acute phase, PSs exhibited pronounced calcium elevations and strong constriction, amplifying downstream capillary constriction through spatially localized calcium signaling. Following reperfusion, excessive calcium elevations persisted without proportional diameter changes, indicating calcium signaling dysregulation and early uncoupling between mural cell calcium dynamics and vascular responses. In the chronic phase, ischemia induced PS-associated loss of contractile pericytes, leading to capillary dilation and sustained impairment of neurovascular coupling. Although pericyte coverage and calcium signaling partially recovered from second week post stroke, whisker-evoked vascular responses and calcium sensitivity remained compromised. At the network level, blood flow responses became spatially heterogeneous, with pericyte-lost regions exhibiting prolonged hyporesponsiveness during functional hyperemia. These findings identify PSs as key regulators of ischemia-induced microvascular dysfunction and highlight mural cell calcium dysregulation and pericyte loss as drivers of persistent neurovascular uncoupling after stroke.",

      "title": "ANKS1B in the Nucleus Accumbens controls escalated cocaine self-administration via regulating CBP-FoxO3 complex",
      "content": "The transition from controlled to escalated drug intake is a core feature of cocaine use disorder (CUD), yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavioral escalation remain poorly defined. Our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified ANKS1B as a significant shared genetic risk factor for heroin, methamphetamine, and alcohol dependence, suggesting a broad role in addiction vulnerability. However, the specific function of ANKS1B in cocaine addiction and its associated neural mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that ANKS1B expression level in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) was downregulated after extended cocaine use, and manipulating ANKS1B could selectively influence the escalation of cocaine intake and the subsequent cocaine-seeking behavior in the long-access cocaine self-administration rat model. Molecular experiments reveal that ANKS1B interacts with the histone acetyltransferase CBP to control H3K27 acetylation and extended cocaine intake, via epigenetically repressing the transcription factor FoxO3. Overall, these findings suggest that ANKS1B is a crucial factor influencing the escalation of cocaine use. The ANKS1B-CBP-FoxO3 signaling pathway presents a promising target for potential therapeutic interventions for controlling extended cocaine use.",

      "title": "A Quantitative Benchmark of Visual Information in Human Brain Recordings Across fMRI, MEG, and EEG",
      "content": "Noninvasive human brain recordings such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG are widely used to study visual representations, yet their relative information content has never been quantitatively benchmarked under matched experimental conditions. Here, we develop a unified decoding framework that enables fair cross-modal comparison using identical naturalistic stimuli (THINGS) and a common decoding analysis. Using a matched stimulus set, we first quantify modality performance via object-category decoding accuracy. Under these conditions, fMRI yielded the highest accuracy (mean 87%), MEG showed intermediate performance (mean 35%), and single-subject EEG achieved lower accuracy (mean 7%), while remaining reliably above chance level (1%). Notably, EEG performance improved substantially when decoding outputs were aggregated across participants in the form of a stimulus-level relational structure, yielding a group-level EEG measure (28%) with accuracy comparable to MEG. We then examined how decoding performance scales with the number of training stimuli and effective measurement time. These analyses revealed distinct efficiency-precision trade-offs across modalities: MEG and group-level EEG were most efficient for short measurement times, whereas fMRI achieved the highest asymptotic performance when sufficient data were collected. Together, these findings demonstrate that modality performance differs systematically even under tightly matched conditions and that decoding provides a principled way to assess the information content of fMRI, MEG, and EEG. The proposed unified framework offers practical guidelines for modality selection, experimental design, and data collection planning in neuroscience.",

      "content": "<p>Yesterday my production app went down. The cause? DigitalOcean's managed PostgreSQL update broke private VPC connectivity to their managed Kubernetes.<p>Public endpoint worked. Private endpoint timed out. Root cause: a Cilium bug (#34503) where ARP entries go stale after infrastructure changes.<p>DO support responded relatively quickly (<12hrs). Their fix? Deploy a DaemonSet from a random GitHub user to ping stale ARP entries every 10 seconds. The upstream Cilium fix is merged but not yet deployed to DOKS. No ETA.<p>I chose managed services specifically to avoid ops emergencies. We're a tiny startup paying the premium so someone else handles this. Instead, I spent late night hours debugging VPC routing issues in a networking layer I don't control.<p>HN's usual advice is \"just use managed services, focus on the business.\" Generally good advice. But managed doesn't mean worry-free, it means trading your failure modes for the vendor's failure modes. You're not choosing between problems and no problems. You're choosing between problems you control and (fewer?) problems you don't.<p>Still using DO. Still using managed services.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Thrilled to be launching <a href=\"https://github.com/katanemo/plano\">Plano</a> (0.4+)- an edge and service proxy (aka data plane) with orchestration for agentic apps. Plano offloads the rote plumbing work like orchestration, routing, observability and guardrails not central to any codebase but tightly coupled today in the application layer thanks to the many hundreds of AI frameworks out there.</p> <p>Runs alongside your app servers (cloud, on-prem, or local dev) deployed as a side-car, and leaves GPUs where your models are hosted.</p> <p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>AI practitioners will probably tell you that calling an LLM is not the hard. The really hard part is delivering agentic apps to production quickly and reliably, then iterating without rewriting system code every time. In practice, teams keep rebuilding the same concerns that sit outside any single agent\u2019s core logic:</p> <p>This includes model choice - the ability to pull from a large set of LLMs and swap providers without refactoring prompts or streaming handlers. Developers need to learn from production by collecting signals and traces that tell them what to fix. They also need consistent policy enforcement for moderation and jailbreak protection, rather than sprinkling hooks across codebases. And they need multi-agent patterns to improve performance and latency without turning their app into orchestration glue.</p> <p>These concerns get rebuilt and maintained inside fast-changing frameworks and application code, coupling product logic to infrastructure decisions. It\u2019s brittle, and pulls teams away from core product work into plumbing they shouldn\u2019t have to own.</p> <p><strong>What Plano does</strong></p> <p>Plano moves core delivery concerns out of process into a modular proxy and dataplane designed for agents. It supports inbound listeners (agent orchestration, safety and moderation hooks), outbound listeners (hosted or API-based LLM routing), or both together. Plano provides the following capabilities via a unified dataplane:</p> <p>- Orchestration: Low-latency routing and handoff between agents. Add or change agents without modifying app code, and evolve strategies centrally instead of duplicating logic across services.</p> <p>- Guardrails &amp; Memory Hooks: Apply jailbreak protection, content policies, and context workflows (rewriting, retrieval, redaction) once via filter chains. This centralizes governance and ensures consistent behavior across your stack.</p> <p>- Model Agility: Route by model name, semantic alias, or preference-based policies. Swap or add models without refactoring prompts, tool calls, or streaming handlers.</p> <p>- Agentic Signals\u2122: Zero-code capture of behavior signals, traces, and metrics across every agent, surfacing traces, token usage, and learning signals in one place.</p> <p>The goal is to keep application code focused on product logic while Plano owns delivery mechanics.</p> <p><strong>On Architecture</strong></p> <p>Plano has two main parts:</p> <p>Envoy-based data plane. Uses Envoy\u2019s HTTP connection management to talk to model APIs, services, and tool backends. We didn\u2019t build a separate model server\u2014Envoy already handles streaming, retries, timeouts, and connection pooling. Some of us were core Envoy contributors.</p> <p>Brightstaff, a lightweight controller and state machine written in Rust. It inspects prompts and conversation state, decides which agents to call and in what order, and coordinates routing and fallback. It uses small LLMs (1\u20134B parameters) trained for constrained routing and orchestration. These models do not generate responses and fall back to static policies on failure.

It calculates your Body Mass Index, supports flexible units (weight in kg or lbs, height in cm/m/ft/in), automatically saves your history with dates, and gives personalized health advice based on BMI categories (Underweight to Extreme Obesity). It's fully offline and stores data in a text file so your records persist between runs.</p> <p><strong>**Target Audience*\\</strong>*<br /> This is primarily a toy/learning project for beginners like me (first real shipped app after ~1 month of Python from zero). It's useful for anyone wanting a private, no-internet BMI tracker (e.g., students, fitness enthusiasts, or people who prefer console tools over web/apps). Not meant for production or medical use \u2014 just fun and educational!</p> <p><strong>**Comparison*\\</strong>*<br /> Unlike online BMI calculators (which require internet and don't save history), or basic scripts (which often lack unit flexibility or persistence), this one combines:<br /> - Multi-unit input (no conversion needed by user)<br /> - Automatic file-based history tracking<br /> - Motivational messages per category<br /> - Easy menu and delete option<br /> It's more feature-rich than most beginner projects while staying simple and local.</p> <p>Repo link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker</a></p> <p>Screenshots:<br /> ![Menu](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/menu.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/menu.png</a>)<br /> ![Calculation](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/calculation.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/calculation.png</a>)<br /> ![History](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/history.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/history.png</a>)</p> <p>Feedback welcome!

      "content": "Motor and episodic memories are classically conceptualised as distinct memory domains. However, both memory sequences are characterised by order and timing of their elements. Generalisation has been previously documented between these different memories, with a shared ordinal structure facilitating learning. However, it is unclear whether this generalisation also applies to the timing structure of a sequence. In a between-subject design, healthy adults (N = 143) learned and reproduced motor and episodic memory sequences with either the same or different timing structures. Contrary to expectations, recall of an episodic timeline was poorer when preceded by learning a motor sequence with the same timing structure. Motor sequence reproduction was not affected by prior episodic encoding. The findings do not support the hypothesis of cross-domain generalisation of timing structure between episodic and motor memories. However, the observed interference may suggest some overlap in the mechanism encoding timing information between memory systems.",
