      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "content": "An ambition of neuroscience is to identify fundamental patterns of neural activity that are shared across the brain. Such patterns may occur in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are coupled to the population and fire in 50-100 ms sequences. Here we show that these sequences are stable over time and ubiquitous across the brain. Chronic Neuropixels recordings in mouse visual cortex revealed that each neuron was coupled to the local population with a characteristic strength and delay. Stimulus responses formed a sequence where neuronal participation depended on tuning, but delay was fixed. This sequence interacted multiplicatively with the rate code, appeared even during spontaneous activity, and remained stable for weeks. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that the sequences occur across the entire mouse brain and are often synchronized across regions. These results reveal a stable scaffold for brainwide activity and suggest that the sequences support a canonical computation operating across the brain.",

      "content": "The waxing and waning cortical oscillatory power correlates with function and disease. This cross-trial variability has been thought to be due to neuromodulation, uncertainty encoding, and/or changes in cortical excitability. Here, we report evidence that it is also due to fluctuations in ephaptic influences of mesoscale electric fields. We analyzed LFP data from the PFC recorded during a spatial delay saccade task. We constructed a model that describes the electric field close to the cortical patch given the neural activity that generates it. This revealed that field-to-neuron interactions (ephaptic coupling strength) was stronger that neuron-to-field and it correlated trial by trial changes in oscillatory power. This suggests a form of circular causality where neural activity and extracellular electric fields continuously shape each other. These results further suggest that mesoscale ephaptic effects help drive the formation of memory ensembles, a prediction of the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis.",

      "content": "Understanding how spinal circuits shape motor neuron behavior during muscle contractions remains a major challenge. Here, we combined large-scale motor unit recordings with simulation-based inference to generate probabilistic estimates of homonymous and heteronymous recurrent inhibition, a key spinal circuit that has remained mostly inaccessible during natural voluntary contractions. We constructed synchronization cross-histograms from motor neuron spike trains and extracted features representative of recurrent inhibition. Because these features are influenced by higher-frequency components of common synaptic input, we developed a simulation-based inference framework to disentangle these effects. Following validation, we applied this framework to experimental data from six muscles and two contraction intensities, revealing previously uncharacterized muscle- and intensity-dependent patterns: recurrent inhibition decreased with contraction intensity in most muscles but increased in the vastus lateralis and medialis. The pipeline is openly available and designed for reuse on comparable datasets and adaptation to diverse experimental contexts, including other spinal circuits.",

      "title": "Age-related sensory dysfunction reconfigures the spinal circuitry for touch, itch and pain",
      "content": "Sensory dysfunction during aging results in sharp increases in the incidence of chronic itch and pain, which counterintuitively are associated with reduced sensitivity to light touch. While age-related changes in peripheral mechanosensory transmission have been described, the contribution central mechanisms make to altered itch and pain responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that signalling from cutaneous touch receptors is essential for maintaining the cellular composition of the central somatosensory circuits that process itch and pain information in adult mice. In particular, the loss of excitatory signalling from Merkel cells during aging causes the degeneration of subsets of molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, including inhibitory neurons that express the neuropeptide NPY. Our demonstration that the activity-dependent loss of inhibitory NPY neurons drives itch and pain hypersensitivity in old animals reveals the mechanism by which aging reconfigures the central neuronal circuits that sense touch, itch and pain.",

      "title": "Visual input drives diverse ER calcium signals in neurons in vivo",
      "content": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has long been thought to shape calcium signals in neurons, but stimulus-driven ER calcium fluctuations have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure neuronal ER calcium signals in vivo, we paired visual stimulus presentation with two photon imaging of ER and cytosolic calcium reporters in four different cell types in the Drosophila visual system. We found that visual input elicits diverse ER calcium signals, with the ER acting as a calcium sink or source depending on the cell type, subcellular compartment (dendrite versus axon), and type of visual stimulus. ER calcium signals were not simply a reflection of cytosolic signals, indicating that the ER, rather than acting as a passive calcium buffer, actively processes calcium signals in neurons in a context-specific fashion. Thus, ER-based signal processing may contribute to functional diversity across neuronal cell types, thereby enhancing the computational capacity of neural circuits.",

      "title": "Single cell RNA sequencing reveals limited effects of Lrrk2 genotype in a mouse model of acute CNS inflammation",
      "content": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Previous data implicates neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Of the genes associated with PD, Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has previously been proposed to play a role in neuroinflammation. However, the extent to which LRRK2 is involved in endogenous inflammatory signaling is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous mutations in LRRK2 affect responses to neuroinflammation in vivo. METHODS: We injected cohorts of mice with knock-in mutations in Lrrk2, homologous to those causing human PD, with a single intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control. We used single cell RNA-Sequencing to examine cell type specific responses to treatment and genotype and validated key results with orthogonal approaches. RESULTS: We found that our chosen paradigm of acute LPS exposure evokes robust transcriptional changes consistent with a multicellular neuroinflammatory response. We also found evidence of peripheral immune cell recruitment into the brain and interaction with brain-resident microglia. However, the transcriptional effects of Lrrk2 mutations were limited to small numbers of genes, including down regulation of gene ontogeny terms related to lysosomes, in microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly demonstrate that many cells in the brain respond to a single inflammatory insult with strong transcriptional responses and that, even in a model focused on CNS injection, there is interaction between peripheral and central immune cells. In contrast, the quantitative effects of Lrrk2 mutations are modest at the transcriptional level, demonstrating that additional studies are needed to clarify whether Lrrk2 mutations affect neuroinflammation in an endogenous context.",
