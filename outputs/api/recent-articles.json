      "title": "Tonically active interneurons gate motor output in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "Tonic inhibition and its transient removal are fundamental neural mechanisms for gating activity, suppressing out-of-phase excitation, and enhancing the temporal precision of behavior. However, their roles within locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs) remain poorly understood. Here, we identify A02l neurons - segmentally repeated excitatory interneurons in the Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) - that regulate crawling behavior through tonic inhibition. A02l neurons exhibit high baseline activity and are transiently suppressed during motor output. They provide excitatory input to inhibitory premotor networks, enabling widespread silencing of motor neurons to maintain muscle relaxation. Optogenetic activation of A02l neurons reduced crawling frequency, whereas their inhibition induced transient whole-body contractions. Together, these findings reveal a cellular-resolution mechanism for tonic inhibition within the nerve cord and highlight its importance in gating motor output and maintaining motor quiescence.",

      "title": "Mechanobiological Specialization of Choroid Plexus Macrophages Defined by Titin Expression",
      "content": "Functioning both as the site of cerebrospinal fluid production and as an interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system, the choroid plexus (ChP) modulates the gating of immune cells and signals from the periphery as they pass from the blood into cerebrospinal fluid. We generated a single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the adult human ChP, in donors with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing transcriptionally and spatially distinct macrophage states. We identified a previously unrecognized population of titin-expressing (TTN+) tissue-resident macrophages characterized by coordinated activation of cytoskeletal remodeling, phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory programs. Isoform-specific qPCR, protein immunofluorescence, and single-molecule FISH validated TTN expression in situ. In AD, TTN+ macrophages expand and undergo broad transcriptional rewiring, including activation of MEF2-linked mechanotransduction pathways, elevated senescence signatures, and a loss of ligand-receptor connectivity with epithelial, endothelial, and stromal partners. Collectively, our findings define a mechanosensitive macrophage program at the blood-CSF interface and uncover a TTN-associated shift in macrophage function and microenvironment integration in AD.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Pingram is a lightweight, one-dependency Python library for sending Telegram messages, photos, documents, audio, and video using your bot. It\u2019s focused entirely on outbound alerts, ideal for scripts, bots, or internal tools that need to notify a user or group via Telegram as a free service.</p> <p>No webhook setup, no conversational interface, just direct message delivery using HTTPX under the hood.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>from pingram import Pingram bot = Pingram(token=&quot;&lt;your-token&gt;&quot;) bot.message(chat_id=123456789, text=&quot;Backup complete&quot;) </code></pre> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Pingram is designed for:</p> <ul> <li>Developers who want fast, scriptable messaging without conversational features</li> <li>Users replacing email/SMS alerts in cron jobs, containers, or monitoring tools</li> <li>Python devs looking for a minimal alternative to heavier Telegram bot frameworks</li> <li>Projects that want to embed notifications without requiring stateful servers or polling</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s production-usable for simple alerting use cases but not intended for full-scale bot development.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Compared to python-telegram-bot, Telethon, or aiogram:</p> <ul> <li>Pingram is &lt;100 LOC, no event loop, no polling, no webhooks \u2014 just a clean HTTP client</li> <li>Faster to integrate for one-off use cases like \u201csend this report\u201d or \u201cnotify on job success\u201d</li> <li>Easier to audit, minimal API surface, and no external dependencies beyond httpx</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s more of a messaging transport layer than a full bot framework.</p> <p>Would appreciate thoughts, use cases, or suggestions.

      "title": "Enhancer-based AAV approach for selective AADC delivery reduces motor symptoms and dyskinesia in Parkinson's mouse models",
      "content": "Profound degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons and reduced DA levels in the brain is recognized as an underlying cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The standard treatment for PD is levodopa (L-DOPA), but its effectiveness wanes over time and prolonged usage can lead to L-DOPA-induced-dyskinesia (LID). An adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to overexpress aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the striatum combined with L-DOPA therapy shows promise for symptomatic improvement but requires an invasive delivery approach. Here, we generated enhancer AAVs to drive AADC expression in key cell types and paired them with a blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant capsid. We characterized the AAVs in mouse following multiple routes of administration and found that cell-type specific viral treatment ameliorated motor deficits and LID in PD disease models. This cell type-specific viral rescue strategy showed similar or better phenotypic rescue compared to a ubiquitous targeting approach and improved mortality. Additionally, we characterized the expression of an AAV-AADC vector capable of mouse phenotypic rescue in non-human primate (NHP) following two routes of administration. This novel therapeutic strategy in combination with L-DOPA may enable a less invasive and better tolerated approach to treat motor deficits in PD patients.",
