      "title": "Serum Lipidome as an Early Peripheral Indicator in Familial Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Protein biomarkers in biofluids are highly sensitive indicators of prodromal cognitive impairment yet remain limited for primary prevention. Lipids, essential to brain structure and function, offer untapped prognostic value. Here, we identify a lipidomic signature in serum from asymptomatic PSEN1-E280A mutation carriers aged 6-40 years, that differentiate carriers from non-carriers with an AUC 80-90%. Similarly, to symptomatic carriers (older 41 years; 93%) and sporadic AD cases (85%), using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Latent profile analysis revealed lipid-based signatures of dementia risk and resilience, shaped by genotype, sex, and APOE isoform, and supported by SIMOA protein biomarkers. Age-dependent dysregulation in sphingolipid and glycolipid metabolism was validated by enzymatic activity (TLC), glial phenotyping (flow cytometry), and gene expression (snRNAseq) in postmortem brain. Ganglioside clearance deficits emerged by age 6-12, followed by proinflammatory shifts from age 13 and p-tau217 elevation by age 20, with greater burden in females and APOE4 carriers. APOE3Ch individuals showed differential salvage pathways of ceramides and gangliosides. These findings position early lipid pathway dysregulation as a biological contributor to Alzheimers pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for primary prevention.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been working on a lot of API integrations lately, and one thing that kept slowing me down was testing webhooks. Whenever I needed to see what an external service was sending to my endpoint, I had to set up a tunnel, open a dashboard, or mess with some configuration. Most of the time, I just wanted to see the raw request quickly so I could keep working.</p> <p>So I ended up building a small Python tool called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/fasthook/\">fasthook</a>. The idea is really simple. You install it, run one command, and you instantly get a local webhook endpoint that shows you everything that hits it. No accounts, no external services, nothing complicated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JermyDiscord\"> /u/JermyDiscord </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9cnqq/built_a_small_opensource_tool_fasthook_to_quickly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p9cnqq/built_a_small_opensource_tool_fasthook_to_quickly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid associated with overdose. However, little is known about fentanyl-induced molecular adaptations in the habenula and amygdala, two brain regions implicated in opioid use and withdrawal. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing in the rat habenula and amygdala to identify transcriptomic changes associated with fentanyl intake. Rats self-administered intravenous saline or fentanyl over 22-24 days. Ninety minutes following the final session, habenula and amygdala were collected for transcriptomic profiling. In Hb, we identified 453 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between saline and fentanyl rats, with upregulated genes associated with synaptic transmission and ionic conductance. In amygdala, we identified 3,041 fentanyl-associated DEGs with upregulated genes implicated in metabolic and vesicular functions. Downregulated genes in both regions were enriched for extracellular matrix functions. Integration of DEGs with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from rodents and humans revealed that fentanyl DEGs were enriched in specific habenula and amygdala cell type markers. Furthermore, fentanyl downregulated DEGs in amygdala were enriched in genes associated with risk for substance use disorders. Together, we define how fentanyl intake alters transcriptional programs in the habenula and amygdala, and we link these changes to specific human cell types and risk genes for neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction.",
