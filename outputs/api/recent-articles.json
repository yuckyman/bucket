      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Peripheral modulation of Pumilio in intestinal stem cells and the corpus allatum affects sleep latency in Drosophila",
      "content": "While central circuits governing sleep are well-studied, the contribution of signaling from peripheral tissues remains a critical yet less understood aspect of sleep regulation. The highly conserved RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum) is a post-transcriptional regulator expressed in multiple tissues that influence systemic physiology, but its role in modulating basal sleep has not been established. Although Pumilios function in central neurons has been linked to sleep homeostasis following deprivation, whether it regulates sleep through peripheral mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we use conditional genetic tools in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate that Pumilio acts in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the endocrinecorpus allatum (CA) to specifically regulate the transition to sleep. Reducing Pumilio function in either the ISCs or the CA independently and significantly accelerates nighttime sleep onset, while overexpression produces the opposite effect. This behavioral change is accompanied by widespread transcriptional alterations in the brain, characterized by a robust upregulation of genes involved in cellular stress responses, including Heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83). Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-endocrine-brain signaling axis and identify peripheral post-transcriptional regulation as a key input to the central control of sleep behavior.",

However, in this issue of Nature Neuroscience, Golden et al. show that higher states of endogenous estrogen enhance reward prediction errors in sophisticated ways, which promotes adaptive behavior and improves performance.",
