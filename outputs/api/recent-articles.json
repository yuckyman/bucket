      "content": "Studying the brain in motion promises deep insights into the neural circuits that support complex, real-world behaviour. In humans, wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond temporal resolution and millimetre spatial precision during movement. Integrating this technology with virtual reality (VR) could enable fully naturalistic experimental paradigms, but magnetic interference from existing head-mounted displays (HMDs) prevents reliable whole-brain MEG recordings. Here, we present and validate a VR system that integrates with wearable, OPM-based MEG. At its core is a purpose-designed HMD with minimal ferromagnetic material, resulting in magnetic flux density two orders of magnitude lower than consumer-grade alternatives at comparable resolution and weight. Using phantom measurements and established perceptual and cognitive benchmark tasks across participants, we demonstrate robust stimulus-induced neuronal activity at both sensor and source level. Crucially, these sources span the entire brain, including visual, motor and prefrontal cortices, as well as hippocampus. Our proposed VR system is straightforward to produce, readily extendable, and enables whole-brain MEG during immersive, naturalistic behaviours.",

      "title": "Avatar facial expressions enhance social presence and inter-brain synchronization in virtual reality",
      "content": "Virtual reality (VR) has become a prominent medium for computer-mediated social interaction, yet the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning avatar-mediated communication remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how dynamically modulated avatar facial expressions shape interpersonal interaction in VR. Pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative creativity task while interacting via avatars whose facial expressions were either amplified, natural, or expressionless. We collected subjective measures of body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction, while simultaneously recording neural activity using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy-based hyperscanning to assess inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Avatars displaying facial expressions, particularly amplified ones, significantly enhanced body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction compared to expressionless avatars. At the neural level, visible avatar facial expressions were associated with IBS in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), regions that are commonly implicated in social-cognitive processes such as mentalizing and executive control. Although task performance did not differ across conditions, social presence was positively correlated with creative performance, suggesting that psychological connectedness supports collaborative creativity. Together, these findings indicate that avatar facial expressivity functions as a critical nonverbal social cue that facilitates affective and cognitive alignment between interaction partners. By linking subjective experience with inter-brain neural dynamics, this study provides empirical guidance for the design of virtual environments that promote social engagement and effective collaboration.",

      "title": "The schizophrenia associated protein DISC1 is a multivalent tetrameric hub of conserved ancient fold",
      "content": "DISC1 is a pleiotropic protein with essential roles in neuronal proliferation and migration, intracellular signalling and cargo transport. It associates with a diverse array of partner molecules in these contexts. Mutations at the DISC1 locus are strongly associated with a spectrum of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular architecture and function of DISC1 have remained largely elusive. We present a cryo-EM structure of the entire conserved core region of DISC1. The structure reveals an intricate homotetrameric assembly that harbours conserved bacteria-derived UVR domains. Four of these domains, one from each monomer, mediate extensive contacts forming two asymmetric dimer units. The dimers in turn interface with each other at two distinct coiled coil domains to achieve a two-fold symmetric tetramer. Mutational analysis shows that this tetrameric architecture enables DISC1 to simultaneously bind multiple copies of NDE1 client protein. Importantly, tetramerization and partner binding are structurally independent functions of DISC1. Altogether, our study provides a compelling molecular model of an ancient bacteria protein fold participating in the assembly of a multivalent mammalian scaffold hub that can coordinate multiple partner molecules.",

      "title": "High-fidelity backpropagation through primate foveal cones",
      "content": "Primate vision has exceptionally high spatial acuity and contrast sensitivity. This performance originates in specialized photoreceptors of the fovea. These cones transduce light into electrical signals in the outer segment, and convey these signals to the presynaptic terminal for transmission. Backpropagating signals are also possible, as the terminal receives gap-junctional input from neighboring cones. Such signals could influence phototransduction itself. To test this idea, we recorded electrophysiologically from both ends of single cones dissociated from the macaque fovea. We found that backpropagation was effective despite the extreme slenderness and length of these cells. Backpropagation was also effective in a passive compartmental model, indicating that amplification by voltage-gated channels is not required. We then modeled mosaics of foveal cones coupled by terminal gap junctions. Despite faithful backpropagation of these inputs, they appear unlikely to influence phototransduction. Thus, even though foveal cones exhibit effective backpropagation, their encoding of visual information remains compartmentalized.",

      "title": "Higher-order intrinsic routes support flexible task-evoked communication",
      "content": "Flexible task-evoked communication requires the brain to transiently establish functional interactions that are not evident during rest, yet the network mechanisms supporting these newly formed connections remain unresolved. Using whole-brain functional MRI from 92 participants performing six cognitive tasks, we show that task-evoked communication is implemented within a constrained intrinsic network architecture rather than through large-scale rewiring. Across tasks, we found that approximately 70% of functional connections were preserved from rest, forming a dominant stable core, while task engagement selectively reconfigured a smaller subset of connections, primarily at the between-network level. While existing activity-flow models explain task-evoked information transfer primarily through direct stable core connections, we demonstrate that newly formed connections between regions lacking direct resting-state coupling were supported by selectively strengthened indirect higher-order resting-state routes embedded within the intrinsic scaffold. Network-level analyses revealed a multiscale organization of information transfer: we observed that direct stable routes dominated within-network communication, most prominently in sensory-motor and default mode systems, whereas indirect higher-order routes preferentially supported between-network integration through control and attentional systems. By extending activity-flow modelling to incorporate these higher-order intrinsic routes, we show a significant improvement in the prediction of task-evoked activity at the global, between-network scale, confirming their functional recruitment during task performance. Together, our findings identify higher-order intrinsic routes as a key mechanism enabling flexible task-evoked communication within a stable large-scale network architecture.",
