      "content": "IntroductionThe relationship between glaucoma and neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex has yet to be fully explored and understood. This study employs the time-domain (TD) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to noninvasively monitor the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in the visual cortex.Methods203 eyes (104 subjects, 46 females, 58 males): 44 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 38 with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 54 with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 67 without abnormal/pathologic condition, were analyzed. All subjects had a complete eye examination, including Goldmann tonometry, computerized visual field optical coherence tomography, pattern electroretinogram, and visual evoked potentials. Visual cortex HRF was assessed by TD-fNIRS using a standard stimulation protocol (reversed checkerboard at 10\u202fHz). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to obtain groups (clusters) of eyes based on the respective TD-fNIRS parameters. The relationships between the clusters and the diagnostic groups were assessed by comparing the distributions of the former ones among healthy, hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes.ResultsWe found six clusters of eyes, five representing eyes with consistent measurements of HRF amplitudes across acquisition channels (left/right hemisphere) and repeated stimuli, distinguished by distinct magnitudes of neurovascular coupling. The sixth cluster included all the cases of incoherent HRF patterns. Evidence of a different distribution between glaucomatous and healthy eyes was found (p\u202f=\u202f0.0009), suggesting that high levels of neurovascular coupling are less likely to be observed in NTG and OAG groups.ConclusionOccipital TD-fNIRS could be fruitfully implemented in a clinical setting to provide significant and easy-to-get insights on neurovascular dynamics, supporting the differential diagnosis of glaucomatous patients. Our findings highlight the importance of the underappreciated correlates between glaucoma and overall neurologic status.",

      "content": "IntroductionMotor imagery (MI) classification and sleep apnea (SA) detection are two critical tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) and biomedical signal analysis. Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

      "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",

      "title": "The interaction of regulated forms of cell death in the pathogenesis of severe facial paralysis and potential therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Neuronal cell death plays a central role in the pathogenesis of facial paralysis. In the constructed severe facial paralysis model, axonal damage becomes the key factor triggering retrograde neuronal degeneration, resulting in a large number of neuronal deaths, which seriously affects the function of the facial nerve. The basic fibroblast growth factor exhibits strong neuroprotective ability and can significantly reduce the neuronal mortality rate, providing a strong guarantee for neuronal survival. Viral infection is also an important pathogenic factor that cannot be ignored. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 can trigger neuroinflammation through the immune response, further exacerbating nerve damage. However, recent studies have also brought hope. Neural reconstruction techniques, targeted drugs, and stem cell therapies hold potential value in promoting the recovery of damaged neural functions. These research results reveal that multiple factors affect the survival and function of neurons in facial paralysis through different pathways, laying a theoretical foundation for targeted treatment against neuronal death. In the future, based on these mechanisms, developing new therapies will bring new treatment opportunities for patients with severe facial paralysis, potentially improving their prognosis and significantly enhancing their quality of life, with important clinical value.",

      "title": "Generate-Then-Validate: A Novel Question Generation Approach Using Small Language Models",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10110v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.",

      "title": "Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10065v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.",

      "title": "Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.10058v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.",

Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of \"being together\" enhances communication. An \"Embodied Information Hub\" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.09931v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.",
