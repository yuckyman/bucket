      "content": "arXiv:2509.12752v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI's transformative impact on work, education, and everyday life makes it as much a political artifact as a technological one. Current AI models are opaque, centralized, and overly generic. The algorithmic automation they provide threatens human agency and democratic values in both workplaces and daily life. To confront such challenges, we turn to Scandinavian Participatory Design (PD), which was devised in the 1970s to face a similar threat from mechanical automation. In the PD tradition, technology is seen not just as an artifact, but as a locus of democracy. Drawing from this tradition, we propose Participatory AI as a PD approach to human-centered AI that applies five PD principles to four design challenges for algorithmic automation. We use concrete case studies to illustrate how to treat AI models less as proprietary products and more as shared socio-technical systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency, human dignity, and human values.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12709v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Semi-structured interviews highly rely on the quality of follow-up questions, yet interviewers' knowledge and skills may limit their depth and potentially affect outcomes. While many studies have shown the usefulness of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis, their possibility in the data collection process remains underexplored. We adopt an AI-driven \"Wizard-of-Oz\" setup to investigate how real-time LLM support in generating follow-up questions shapes semi-structured interviews. Through a study with 17 participants, we examine the value of LLM-generated follow-up questions, the evolving division of roles, relationships, collaborative behaviors, and responsibilities between interviewers and AI. Our findings (1) provide empirical evidence of the strengths and limitations of AI-generated follow-up questions (AGQs); (2) introduce a Human-AI collaboration framework in this interview context; and (3) propose human-centered design guidelines for AI-assisted interviewing. We position LLMs as complements, not replacements, to human judgment, and highlight pathways for integrating AI into qualitative data collection.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12626v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI -- consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12590v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper explores how programmers without specialized expertise in differential privacy (DP) (i.e., novices) can leverage LLMs to implement DP programs with minimal training. We first conducted a need-finding study with 6 novices and 3 experts to understand how they utilize LLMs in DP implementation. While DP experts can implement correct DP analyses through a few prompts, novices struggle to articulate their requirements in prompts and lack the skills to verify the correctness of the generated code. We then developed DPCheatSheet, an instructional tool that helps novices implement DP using LLMs. DPCheatSheet combines two learning concepts: it annotates an expert's workflow with LLMs as a worked example to bridge the expert mindset to novices, and it presents five common mistakes in LLM-based DP code generation as erroneous examples to support error-driven learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DPCheatSheet with an error identification study and an open-ended DP implementation study.",

While contextual privacy policies (CPPs) present information at the point of risk, they may lack engagement and disrupt tasks. We propose Conflect, an interactive CPP for mobile apps, guided by a reflective thinking framework. Through three workshops with experienced designers and researchers, we constructed the design space of reflective thinking-based CPP design, and identified the disconnect between context and action as the most critical problem. Based on participants' feedback, we designed Conflect to use sidebar alerts, allowing users to reflect on contextualized risks and fostering their control. Our system contextually detects privacy risks, extracts policy segments, and automatically generates risk descriptions with 94.0% policy extraction accuracy on CPP4APP dataset and a 4.35s latency. A user study (N=28) demonstrated that Conflect improves user understanding, trust, and satisfaction while lowering cognitive load compared to CPPs, privacy policies and privacy labels.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2 experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none, premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs. adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013), whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t = 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12517v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate whether long-context interactions between users and LLMs lead to AI mirroring behaviors. We focus on two forms of mirroring: (1) sycophancy -- the tendency of models to be overly agreeable with users, and (2) perspective mimesis -- the extent to which models reflect a user's perspective. Using two weeks of interaction context collected from 38 users, we compare model responses with and without long-context for two tasks: political explanations and personal advice. Our results demonstrate how and when real-world interaction contexts can amplify AI mirroring behaviors. We find that sycophancy increases in long-context, irrespective of the interaction topics. Perspective mimesis increases only in contexts where models can accurately infer user perspectives.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.12419v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Joint visual attention (JVA) provides informative cues on human behavior during social interactions. The ubiquity of egocentric eye-trackers and large-scale datasets on everyday interactions offer research opportunities in identifying JVA in multi-user environments. We propose a novel approach utilizing spatiotemporal tubes centered on attention rendered by individual gaze and detect JVA using deep-learning-based feature mapping. Our results reveal object-focused collaborative tasks to yield higher JVA (44-46%), whereas independent tasks yield lower (4-5%) attention. Beyond JVA, we analyze attention characteristics using ambient-focal attention coefficient K to understand the qualitative aspects of shared attention. Our analysis reveals $\\mathcal{K}$ to converge instances where participants interact with shared objects while diverging when independent. While our study presents seminal findings on joint attention with egocentric commodity eye trackers, it indicates the potential utility of our approach in psychology, human-computer interaction, and social robotics, particularly in understanding attention coordination mechanisms in ecologically valid contexts.",

Yet this exploration rarely follows a neat, linear sequence; problem-solvers constantly shift among searching, creating, and evaluating ideas. Existing interfaces either impose rigid, step-by-step workflows or permit unguided free-form exploration. To strike a balance between flexibility and guidance for augmenting people's efficiency and creativity, we introduce a human-AI collaborative workflow that supports a fluid ideation process. The system surfaces three opt-in aids: (1) high-level schemas to uncover alternative ideas, (2) risk analysis with mitigation suggestions, and (3) steering system-generated suggestions. Users can invoke these supports at any moment, allowing seamless back-and-forth movement among design actions to maintain creative momentum.",

It begins with a discussion of big data and selfhood, the concepts of data selves and data doubles, and the process of identification in the digital age. Next, the literature on online identity theft is reviewed, including its theoretical and empirical aspects. As is evident from that review, AI technologies have increased the speed and scale of identity crimes that were already rampant in the online world, even while they have led to new ways of detecting and preventing such crimes. As with any new technology, AI is currently fuelling an arms race between criminals and law enforcement, with end users often caught powerless in the middle. The chapter closes by exploring some emerging directions and future possibilities of identity theft in the age of AI.",

Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterize as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.",

      "title": "Emergent complexity and rhythms in evoked and spontaneous dynamics of human whole-brain models after tuning through analysis tools",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.12873v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.",

      "title": "Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.12783v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of \"twin\" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "5-Fluorouracil (5 FU) is an antimetabolite widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Despite its central role in many anticancer regimens information on its potential effects on the central nervous system (CNS) remains limited. This study investigated the effects of human dose equivalent 5 FU on the cerebral cortex of rats. Fifty male rats were randomly assigned into five groups (n=10). The control group received intraperitoneal (i.p.) saline while four experimental groups received i.p. 5 FU at 12.5 25 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight. Saline or 5 FU was administered for four consecutive days, followed by alternate-day dosing until day 12. Behavioral assessments were conducted and animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the final test. Cortical tissues were analyzed using biochemical assays histology and immunohistochemistry. 5 FU administration caused dose-dependent decreases in body weight food intake and locomotor activity. Treated rats also showed impaired spatial working memory and reduced time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Biochemically 5 FU significantly increased cortical malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels while total antioxidant capacity and interleukin 10 levels decreased. Histological analysis revealed progressive disruption of cortical cytoarchitecture with increasing doses. 5 FU induces dose-dependent neurotoxicity in the rat cerebral cortex characterized by behavioral deficits, oxidative stress neuroinflammation and histomorphological alterations. These findings highlight the need to better understand and mitigate CNS toxicity associated with 5 FU based chemotherapy.",
