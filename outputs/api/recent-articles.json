      "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
      "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

      "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

      "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",

      "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
      "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

      "title": "Neurochemically-evoked activity in slice preparations of the octopus arm nerve cord",
      "content": "Octopus arms contain circuits that support local sensorimotor integration and autonomy, responsible for fast and flexible behaviors, but their population dynamics remain unknown. The axial nerve cord (ANC) is a series of sucker-associated ganglia whose cortex layer houses multiple classes of intermingled neurons. Here we use calcium imaging in ex vivo slices from arms of Octopus bocki, to visualize how these networks respond to controlled application of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Glutamate and dopamine are dominant excitatory drivers that activate most neurons in the ANC cortex, with a substantial overlapping populations and smaller transmitter-specific subsets. Glutamate continues to excite additional neurons at higher concentration, whereas dopamine responses saturate. Serotonin alone evokes mixed responses but, when applied first, consistently reduces glutamate- and dopamine-driven activation, revealing a state-dependent modulatory role. GABA and octopamine yield weak heterologous effects, and high-dose acetylcholine sharply suppresses global ANC neuronal activity while inducing muscular contraction, consistent with inhibitory cholinergic receptors in arm ganglia. Across conditions, responsive neurons show no evidence of spatial structure, with no clear anatomical segregation by transmitter response profiles. These results provide the first link between neurochemical architecture and real-time firing dynamics in a semi-autonomous circuit.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Neural heterogeneity as a unifying mechanism for efficient learning in spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "title": "Alterations in gut microbiota and plasma metabolites: a multi-omics study of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and plasma metabolites may be associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The interplay between gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in influencing the progression of cognitive impairment in PD is yet to be fully understood and requires further exploration. Our objective was to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in PD cognitive impairment.MethodsWe initially recruited 100 individuals with PD and 50 healthy controls (HCs). After excluding participants based on education level and cognitive screening criteria, the final cohort comprised 38 PD patients and 40 HCs. We examined fecal and plasma specimens from these participants. Cognitive function was assessed via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Gut microbiota was analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing, and plasma metabolites were evaluated via Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Using Spearman correlation to analyze the association between gut microbiota and plasma metabolites.ResultsPD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) exhibited distinct microbial and metabolic profiles compared to PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). Consistent with both the Gut Microbiota Health Index (GMHI) and Gut Microbiota Health Index (MDI), PD-MCI patients exhibited significant gut microbial dysbiosis. Multi-algorithm differential abundance analysis identified g__Eggerthella as a core depleted genus in PD-MCI, consistently validated across both LEfSe and MaAsLin2 analyses. Additional microbial alterations included depletion of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)-producing genera (g__Blautia, g__Lachnoclostridium, g__Erysipelatoclostridium, g__norank_f__norank_o__Oscillospirales, g__Megasphaera, and g__Lactococcus) and enrichment of g__Senegalimassilia in PD-MCI. Metabolite analysis revealed that phenylalanine metabolism (including phenylacetylglutamine, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, and phenylacetylglycine) and PPAR signaling pathways (including 8-hydroxy-5Z,9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) were downregulated in the PD-MCI group, while choline metabolism in cancer (including PC(18:1(11Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) and LysoPC(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)/0:0)) was upregulated. Notably, phenylacetylglutamine demonstrated robust diagnostic potential (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.8222), emerging as a promising biomarker for PD-MCI. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between key microbial taxa (particularly g__Eggerthella and SCFA-producing genera) and metabolites (phenylacetylglutamine, and uridine 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate), suggesting their interactive role in PD cognitive impairment through gut-brain axis mechanisms.ConclusionOur multi-omics study revealed distinct gut microbiota and metabolite alterations in PD patients with cognitive impairment, highlighting gut-brain axis dysfunction. Key microbial and metabolic markers demonstrated diagnostic potential, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of PD-related cognitive decline and potential targets for future therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Effectiveness and safety of magnetic resonance\u2013guided unilateral focused ultrasound subthalamotomy for Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with asymmetric, medication-refractory Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) often continue to experience disabling motor symptoms despite optimized pharmacological management. Magnetic resonance\u2013guided focused ultrasound subthalamotomy (FUS-STN) has recently emerged as a promising, non-invasive alternative for improving motor function. However, its overall clinical efficacy and long-term safety remain the subject of active investigation.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to 30 November 2024. Prospective studies that assessed unilateral FUS-STN in patients with PD were included. Data were pooled using RevMan 5.3 for mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsFour prospective studies (n\u202f=\u202f69) were included. Unilateral FUS-STN significantly reduced the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III scores for the treated hemibody in both the off-medication [MD\u202f=\u202f\u221211.01, 95% CI (\u221212.23, \u22129.80), p\u202f<\u202f0.001] and on-medication states [MD\u202f=\u202f\u22126.51, 95% CI (\u22127.57, \u22125.42), p\u202f<\u202f0.001]. The MDS-UPDRS II (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22123.05, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and 39-item Parkinson\u2019s disease questionnaire summary index (PDQ-39SI) scores (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22126.99, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) also improved. Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was reduced in the short term (MD\u202f=\u202f\u2212149.5\u202fmg, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), although it was attenuated at 12\u202fmonths (p\u202f=\u202f0.09). No significant improvement was observed in MDS-UPDRS IV scores (MD\u202f=\u202f\u22123.29, p\u202f=\u202f0.64). In all included studies, adverse events (AEs) were frequent during and after the procedure, such as postoperative gait and speech disturbance, facial asymmetry, and dyskinesia. However, the majority of AEs were resolved during the 6\u201312\u202fmonth follow-up period.ConclusionUnilateral FUS-STN may offer symptomatic benefits and a general safety profile in selected patients with asymmetric PD. Future investigations should emphasize large-scale, longitudinal, multicenter, and symptom-specific randomized controlled trials to assess the long-term benefits and risks of unilateral FUS-STN in PD patients.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251002754, identifier PROSPERO (CRD420251002754).",
