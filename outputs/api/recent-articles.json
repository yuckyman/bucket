      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
