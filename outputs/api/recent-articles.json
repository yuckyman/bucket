      "title": "Attention to Psuedo-Tone Melodies Enhances Cortical but Not Brainstem Responses in Humans",
      "content": "Auditory selective attention, the ability to focus on specific sounds while ignoring competitors, enables communication in complex soundscapes. Though attention clearly modulates cortical responses to sound, whether and where this modulation occurs in subcortical structures remains disputed. Here, we use electroencephalography to record cortical and subcortical (auditory brainstem responses, ABRs) activity during a selective attention task. Human participants attend to a 3-note melody in one pitch range presented to one ear while ignoring a competing, interleaved melody in a different pitch range played to the other ear (Laffere et al., 2020, 2021). The melodies consist of pitch-evoking pseudo-tones formed by convolving a periodic impulse train with a brief tone pip. These stimuli allow us to measure both ABRs (elicited by each individual tone pip within a pseudo-note) and cortical responses (elicited by the onsets of pseudo-notes) simultaneously. We observed robust ABRs, but no evidence of modulation by attention. Conversely, cortical responses, measured by event related potentials (ERPs), demonstrated attentional modulation of the P1-N1 peak. We conclude that attentional modulation within the brainstem is not measurable in the well-defined peaks of the ABR, which themselves reflect processing up to the input stage to the inferior colliculus.",

      "title": "Loose coupling between Ca2+ channels and release sensors as a synaptic correlate of higher order brain function",
      "content": "In the mature neocortex, functionally distinct areas are built by the same archetypes of neurons, but depending on the area, these neurons and their synapses are engaged in very different functions, ranging from lower order processing of sensory information to higher order associations and cognitive functions. We found significant differences in the functional presynaptic nanoarchitectures of the same types of pyramidal neuron synapses, depending on whether they are located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Synapses in PFC operated with loose microdomain coupling as opposed to tight nanodomain coupling in S1. These differences were associated with significant differences in synaptic timing, efficacy and plasticity between areas. Our data suggest that the mature neocortex uses tuning of synaptic topographies to specialize seemingly identical types of neurons for their required function. They reveal microdomain coupling as a presynaptic structure-function correlate of higher order neocortical functions.",

      "title": "The Inferior Frontal Sulcus, not the Anterior Insula, acts as a late-stage attentional gate for the fast rejection of salient but irrelevant sensory inputs during cognitive tasks",
      "content": "The ability to prioritize behaviorally relevant stimuli is essential for efficient cognition, particularly in distracting environments. The anterior insula (AI), a key node of the salience network, has been proposed to support this selection process by detecting salient events. A similar function, however, has also been attributed to the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), located at the intersection of the ventral and dorsal attention networks. Here, we directly compared the respective contributions of these regions to attentional gatekeeping - the identification and rejection of attention-grabbing yet task-irrelevant \"false positives\" to preserve cognitive resources. We recorded intracranial EEG from 63 patients performing an attentive reading task designed to dissociate salience from task relevance. High-Frequency Activity (HFA) responses between 50 Hz and 150 Hz revealed that the IFS was the only region - across extensive sampling of the frontal and insular cortices - to exhibit consistent, subsecond response dynamics compatible with the filtering of false positives. In contrast, the AI did not participate in the analysis or rejection of distractors and showed only sparse, delayed responses to targets, suggesting a role in coordinating or energizing downstream cognitive or motor processes rather than in salience detection per se. These findings indicate that the IFS - rather than the AI - is the primary late-stage node for attentional gatekeeping during cognitive tasks performed under distracting conditions.",

      "title": "Multi-task Intracranial EEG recordings reveal a Comprehensive Role of the Human Dorsal Anterior Insula in High-Level Cognition",
      "content": "The dorsal anterior insula (dAI) is widely recognized as a cornerstone of human cognition. However, its functional characterization remains the subject of considerable debate and competing theories. Embracing a \"shift in viewpoint\" approach - defining a brain region's function through the observation of the same neural population across diverse experimental contexts - this study used intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from a large cohort of patients to investigate the sub-second neural response dynamics of the human dAI across a broad range of cognitive tasks, spanning visual category discrimination, phonological and semantic processing, attentive visual search, and verbal and visuospatial working memory. This within-subject, multi-task iEEG framework offered a robust basis for decoding the structure-function relationship of the dAI and for empirically testing key predictions of prevailing theoretical models concerning its role. Our findings confirmed the dAI's involvement in the Action-Mode Network and shed new light on the large-scale spatiotemporal organization of that network, while providing novel insights into the interplay between cognitive effort and efficiency.",
