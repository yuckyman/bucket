      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Electrostatic Interaction Determines the Docking Specificity and the Formation of Functional Cx36 Gap Junction Channels",
      "content": "Connexin36 (Cx36) is broadly expressed in neurons and serves as the principal protein to form interneuronal gap junctions (GJs), also known as electrical synapses. Recent high-resolution structures of human Cx36 GJ have revealed crucial electrostatic interactions (ESIs) between two docked Cx36 hemichannels at the second extracellular (E2) loops. Despite their structural importance, the functional roles of these ESIs remain poorly understood. To investigate their significance, we systematically designed and tested a series of missense variants targeting key E2 interface residues, aiming to disrupt or modulate the electrostatic landscape at the docking interface. Based on the ESI pairs defined from the crystal structure, our combined computational calculations and dual patch-clamp experiments in engineered HEK293 cell pairs suggest that at least three ESI residual pairs per E2-E2 interface are required to support functional GJ formation. Furthermore, we found that these unique ESIs of Cx36 ensure its docking specificity to itself, preventing the formation of heterotypic GJs with other brain connexins (Cx26, Cx30, Cx31.3, Cx32, Cx43, Cx45, Cx47). Overall, these findings provide essential molecular and functional insights into the mechanisms governing Cx36 GJ formation and partner specificity, paving the way for future therapeutic approaches targeting connexin dysfunction in human diseases.",
