      "title": "Restoration of Higher-Order Cortical Processing in Rat V2 by Retinal Sheet Transplants in Degenerated Rats",
      "content": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, and effective treatment options are limited once photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are lost. In advanced stages, vision restoration requires strategies that replace or bypass degenerated retinal circuitry. Retinal sheet transplantation using fetal neural retinal tissue has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating long-term survival, integration with the host retina, and partial restoration of light-driven responses. We previously showed that such transplants can restore fundamental visual response properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rapidly degenerating rats. However, it remains unclear whether restored retinal input can support higher-order cortical computations that depend on the integration of classical and extra-classical receptive field mechanisms. In this study, we extend this investigation by evaluating whether fetal retinal sheet transplants can restore extra-classical surround modulation in neurons of higher visual areas (V2). Fetal retinal sheets (E18-E19) derived from donor rats were transplanted into one eye of Rho-S334ter line-3 rats at ages P41-P78, when rod degeneration is nearly complete and cones are largely nonfunctional. Animals were assessed 2.2-9.3 months post-surgery using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings from V2, optokinetic testing, OCT imaging, and histology. Control groups included normal-vision rats, age-matched degenerated rats (AMC), and sham-operated line-3 rats. Transplants survived long term, developed laminated and rosetted photoreceptor structures, and integrated with the host retina. Optokinetic testing revealed significant improvement in spatial acuity in transplanted eyes compared with degenerated controls beginning at three months post-surgery. Transplanted rats exhibited a markedly higher proportion of visually responsive V2 neurons than degenerated animals (21.0% vs. 8.2%). They also showed significantly shorter response latencies and larger visually evoked response amplitudes, indicating improved transmission of retinal signals to the cortex. To quantify surround suppression, neurons were tested with sinusoidal gratings confined to the classical receptive field and gratings extended to full-field size. Transplanted rats displayed robust surround suppression properties similar to normal controls, including significantly reduced firing rates and narrower tuning under full-field conditions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on net responses to CRF and FF stimulus sizes reliably distinguished control and transplanted neurons from degenerated ones but could not separate control from transplant, further indicating similar response properties in these two groups. These findings provide the first demonstration that retinal sheet transplants restore not only basic visual responses but also higher-order cortical mechanisms involving extra-classical surround suppression. This recovery of surround suppression in V2 suggests that transplanted retinal tissue can re-establish functionally meaningful circuits capable of supporting complex visual processing. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of retinal sheet transplantation for advanced retinal degenerative disease and provide the first evidence of surround suppression in the rat V2.",

      "title": "Systematic microcircuit reconfigurations underlie early experience-induced visual cortical plasticity",
      "content": "Experience-dependent reorganization of neuronal connections during a postnatal critical period (CP) is essential for the functional maturation of developing primary visual cortex (V1). However, the systematic reconfigurations across microcircuit synapses underlying this plasticity were poorly defined. Paired recording from excitatory pyramidal cells and other three major interneurons (INs) within layers 2/3 and 4 microcircuits in the developing mouse V1 monocular region, we find that monocular deprivation (MD) for one-day during the CP transiently reconfigures local excitatory synapses on inhibitory INs that specifically express parvalbumin (PV) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), whereas prolonged MD primarily strengthens inhibitory transmission from somatostatin (SST)-expressing INs to PV-INs and VIP-INs in both layers. A physiologically based microcircuit model suggests these coordinated synaptic changes in specific inhibitory neurons mediate differential MD-induced plasticity in visual responses across layer 2/3 neurons in vivo. Together, our findings define a systematic microcircuit basis for cortical critical-period plasticity.",

      "title": "The atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer tianeptine disinhibits hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by reducing GABAergic neurotransmission",
      "content": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer whose actions are thought to be dependent on the activation of opioid receptors, including mu-opioid receptors expressed on hippocampal interneurons. Agonists of these receptors can cause a disinhibition of principal neurons by inhibiting GABA release or interneuron firing. However, direct evidence for a similar action of tianeptine has not previously been reported. We therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on in vivo and in vitro measures of inhibitory synaptic transmission. CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and local field potential (LFP) activity were recorded in area CA1 of anaesthetised rats. To obtain a more direct measure of the actions of tianeptine on GABA release, we also conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (sIPSCs and eIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Intrahippocampal infusion of tianeptine (15 mM; 1 microlitre) caused a marked reduction in paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the population spike (20-ms inter-stimulus interval) elicited in the CA1 cell-body layer. Separate recordings in the stratum radiatum revealed an enhancement of beta and gamma-frequency LFP activity, an effect of tianeptine that we have reported previously. Infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline caused a similar reduction in PPI but did not induce beta/gamma oscillations. In mouse hippocampal slices, tianeptine (50 micromolar) reduced both sIPSC frequency and eIPSC amplitude. These results confirm that tianeptine causes a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells, but suggest that a simple blockade of GABAergic transmission is not alone sufficient to explain its effects on hippocampal network activity.",

      "content": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly functionalized vascular interface which regulates the exchange of substances between the neural parenchyma and its periphery. In vitro models of the BBB have rapidly evolved into elaborated structures, but their cellular components are currently highly heterogeneous in origin and maturation state. Here, we have developed novel procedures to establish reproducible and scalable sources of endothelial, mural and astroglial cells generating a fully human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived BBB model, termed thBBBA, which develops mature functional properties with high barrier impermeability. Mature thBBBAs can also be generated by frozen hPSC-derived cell samples, providing a simple and scalable off-the-shelf system. thBBBAs were instrumental in identifying the critical pathological role of an IL-6 autocrine source in disrupting thBBBA integrity, increasing its permeability to NMDAR antibodies from autoimmune encephalitis patients, and revealing the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab in this setting. Additionally, we have shown that thBBBAs are an invaluable system for ranking the clinical readiness of novel engineered AAV neurotropic capsids, previously selected in animal models or in vitro systems.",

      "title": "Tirzepatide Synergizes with Leptin on Weight Loss and Restoring Metabolic Homeostasis in Diet-induced Obesity Model",
      "content": "Leptin resistance limits anti-obesity efficacy. We identified a leptin-sensitizing mechanism through tirzepatide (TZP), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) dual-agonist. Our tirzepatide clinical trial revealed that circulating leptin levels at baseline correlated with weight loss efficacy in patients with obesity, suggesting leptin and tirzepatide could interact to achieve stronger effects on weight loss. Next, we utilized the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and demonstrated the synergistic effects of tirzepatide and leptin combination (TZP+Lep) on weight loss. TZP+Lep treatment further improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and upregulated thermogenetic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Metabolic profiling under thermoneutrality revealed TZP+Lep treatment further reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Tirzepatide sensitized leptin signaling in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and GLP-1R expressing neurons. TZP+Lep synergistically increased POMC neuronal firing by decreasing the inhibitory postsynaptic input. Together, our work showed combining tirzepatide and leptin as a potential way for better maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in obesity management.",

      "title": "Direction and orientation preferences in mouse superior colliculus and its retinal inputs exhibit a topography of cardinal biases atop locally mixed tuning",
      "content": "In mouse superior colliculus (SC), neurons are robustly tuned to motion direction and orientation, but it remains controversial whether these preferences form global maps or are arranged in a salt-and-pepper fashion, and how this organization relates to that found in the retina and, specifically, the retinal input to the SC. We addressed these questions by combining two-photon calcium imaging of retinal boutons and SC neurons in superficial SC with Neuropixels recordings across the full depth of SC. We then asked how direction and orientation preferences depend on visual-field location and how tuning similarity among units depend on lateral and vertical distance. Retinal boutons were strongly tuned and closely matched the topographic organization of direction- and orientation-selective ganglion cells, confirming that SC receives a highly ordered, retino-centric code for motion and edges. With increasing depth, SC neurons progressively deviated from this organization. Pairwise and population analyses revealed only weak local clustering, confined to very small spatial scales, and no robust global maps of direction or orientation. These results show that mouse SC inherits a topographic organization of cardinal directions and orientations from the retina and transforms it into a broad coverage of directions and orientations at every visual location, likely supporting readout for diverse visually guided behaviors.",
