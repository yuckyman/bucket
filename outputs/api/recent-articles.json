Feedback is very welcome, especially on UX, edge cases or missing features.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/jdvanwijk/dc-input\">https://github.com/jdvanwijk/dc-input</a></p> <p><strong>What my project does</strong></p> <p>I often end up writing small scripts or internal tools that need structured user input, and I kept re-implementing variations of this:</p> <pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class User: name: str age: int | None while True: name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;).strip() if name: break print(&quot;Name is required&quot;) while True: age_raw = input(&quot;Age (optional): &quot;).strip() if not age_raw: age = None break try: age = int(age_raw) break except ValueError: print(&quot;Age must be an integer&quot;) user = User(name=name, age=age) </code></pre> <p>This gets tedious (and brittle) once you add nesting, optional sections, repetition, undo, etc.</p> <p>So I built <strong>dc-input</strong>, which lets you do this instead:</p> <pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass from dc_input import get_input @dataclass class User: name: str age: int | None user = get_input(User) </code></pre> <p>The library walks the dataclass schema and derives an interactive input session from it (nested dataclasses, optional fields, repeatable containers, defaults, undo support, custom parsers via <code>Annotated</code>, etc.).</p> <p>For an interactive session example, see: <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/767996\">https://asciinema.org/a/767996</a></p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This has been mostly been useful for me in internal scripts and small tools where I want structured input without turning the whole thing into a CLI framework.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Compared to prompt libraries like prompt_toolkit and questionary, dc-input is higher-level: you don\u2019t design prompts or control flow by hand \u2014 the structure of your data <em>is</em> the control flow. This makes <code>dc-input</code> more opinionated and less flexible than those examples, so it won\u2019t fit every workflow; but in return you get very fast setup, strong guarantees about correctness, and excellent support for traversing nested data-structures.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emotional-Pipe-335\"> /u/Emotional-Pipe-335 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcjqqc/dcinput_i_got_tired_of_rewriting_interactive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcjqqc/dcinput_i_got_tired_of_rewriting_interactive/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal stress-related prefrontal activation in Tourette disorder",
      "content": "Background: Tics are sudden, partially controllable motor or vocal events that arise from disruptions within cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits. Within this network, converging evidence implicates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as an important cortical node supporting voluntary tic control. This region is critical for top-down regulation and is particularly sensitive to stress, raising the possibility that molecular vulnerabilities within the DLPFC may influence the capacity to suppress tics. However, the underlying cellular and molecular architecture remains poorly defined. Methods: To address this gap, we conducted the first single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis of postmortem DLPFC tissue from men with Tourette disorder (TD) and age-matched neurotypical controls. Results: Overall cell-type proportions did not differ significantly between groups. In contrast, gene ontology analyses revealed broad upregulation of transcripts involved in protein synthesis, most prominently in microglia, oligodendrocytes, and interneurons. Among neuronal lineages, these changes were most pronounced in superficial and middle-layer pyramidal neurons and vasointestinal peptide-positive interneurons. To determine whether these alterations reflect engagement of stress-related transcriptional programs, we compared TD-associated differentially expressed genes with published single-nucleus datasets from major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Across DLPFC cell populations, and especially within pyramidal neurons and interneurons, we observed significant enrichment for stress-associated gene signatures, including glucocorticoid-responsive transcripts and immediate early genes. Conclusion: Together, these findings identify the DLPFC in TD as a region of heightened stress responsivity and altered excitatory-inhibitory dynamics, offering new insight into cortical mechanisms that may constrain tic suppression.",

      "title": "Pathogenic KIF1A variants differentially disrupt axonal trafficking and impede synaptic development",
      "content": "The nervous system relies on billions of neurons connected through trillions of synapses to support a vast array of vital functions. Despite the critical importance of this synaptic network, the cellular mechanisms dictating synapse formation during human neurodevelopment remain unclear. Long-distance trafficking of synaptic components is critical for both synaptogenesis and the maintenance of synaptic function across lifespan. The microtubule motor KIF1A has a highly conserved role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicle precursors, while mutations in KIF1A are causal for the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease KIF1A-Associated Neurological Disorder (KAND). Here, we employ isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) gene-edited to express pathogenic KIF1A variants to assess how disparate mutations alter synaptic trafficking and function. We compared the effects of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations on KIF1A motor activity. We found that both null (p.C92*) and hypoactive (p.P305L) mutations induce delayed neurite outgrowth, mislocalization of synaptic cargos, and decreased synapse density. Conversely, the hyperactive KIF1A mutation (p.R350G) supports neurite outgrowth but leads to aberrant motility of synaptic vesicle precursors along the axon. Further, live imaging reveals that hyperactive KIF1A induces deficits in the microtubule-dependent patterning of presynaptic components along the developing axon, suggesting a failure to respond to cytoskeletal cues directing cargo delivery. Functional analysis of neuronal activity via multi-electrode arrays reveals delayed synaptic maturation in loss-of-function mutations (p.P305L, p.C92*). In contrast, the hyperactive p.R350G mutation exhibits accelerated activity maturation and possible excitotoxicity. Together, these data provide insights detailing how pathogenic variants in KIF1A causative for KAND exhibit distinct effects at the molecular level that lead to significant downstream deficits in synaptic function in human neurons.",

      "title": "A glucocorticoid-responsive polygenic signature in the anterior cingulate cortex moderates the association of early-life adversity and vulnerability for depression",
      "content": "Stress exposure is a major risk factor for psychopathology, yet how stress mediators shape long-term psychiatric vulnerability in humans remains unclear. Glucocorticoids, central effectors of the stress response, regulate gene expression through tissue-specific transcriptional programs, suggesting that glucocorticoid-responsive networks may shape sensitivity to adversity. Using RNA-sequencing following chronic glucocorticoid exposure in a non-human primate model, we identified a gene co-expression network specific to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that was highly preserved across human post-mortem brain datasets relevant to depression. We derived an expression-based polygenic score (ePGS) reflecting genetic variation in network activity and tested its interaction with adversity in the UK Biobank. The ACC-specific glucocorticoid-responsive ePGS moderated the association between adversity and depressive symptoms in adult females, with the strongest effects for early-life adversity. Network genes were enriched for neurodevelopmental processes and showed stronger co-expression during childhood, highlighting a developmentally sensitive, region-specific mechanism linking stress exposure to depression risk.",

      "title": "Levels of shared autonomy in brain-robot interfaces: enabling multi-robot multi-human collaboration for activities of daily living",
      "content": "Individuals with ALS and other severe motor impairments often rely on caregivers for daily tasks, which limits their independence and sense of control. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) have the potential to restore autonomy, but many existing systems are task-specific and highly automated, which reduces the users' sense of empowerment and limits opportunities to exercise autonomy. In particular, shared autonomy approaches hold promise for overcoming current BRI limitations, by balancing user control with increased robot capabilities. In this work, we introduce a collaborative BRI that integrates non-invasive EEG, EMG, and eye tracking to enable multi-user, multi-robot interaction in a shared kitchen environment with mobile manipulators. Our system modulates assistance through three levels of autonomy\u2014Assisted Teleoperation, Shared Autonomy, and Full Automation\u2014allowing users to retain meaningful control over task execution while reducing effort for routine operations. We conducted a controlled user study comparing autonomy conditions, evaluating performance, workload, ease of use, and agency. Our results show that, while Full Automation was generally preferred by users due to lower workload and higher usability, Shared Autonomy provided higher reliability and preserved user agency, especially in the presence of noisy EEG decoding. Although there was significant individual variability in EEG decoding performance, our post-hoc analysis revealed the potential benefits of customizing pipelines for each user. Finally, we note that our findings are specific to the multi-modal configuration tested and should not be interpreted as a universal claim about the superiority of any autonomy level, and, furthermore, our user study was limited by the use of healthy adults rather than target population (e.g., individuals with ALS), gender imbalance, and a relatively small sample size, which may affect generalizability.

      "content": "IntroductionThis study sought to identify early risk factors and develop a predictive model for progression from self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) accompanied by spike-and-wave activation in sleep (SWAS) to epileptic encephalopathy with SWAS (EE-SWAS), aiming to facilitate early clinical intervention.MethodsFrom a pediatric cohort with spike-and-wave index >50%, we analyzed 77 SeLECTS patients (33 progressed to EE-SWAS, 36 remained stable over \u22652 years of follow-up). Baseline clinical and EEG features were comprehensively evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of cognitive regression, which were incorporated into a nomogram-based predictive model. Model performance was assessed using the C-index in both derivation and external validation cohorts.ResultsProlonged spike-and-wave clusters, high-amplitude spikes with secondary generalization, and younger age at first seizure emerged as independent predictors of EE-SWAS progression. The nomogram model demonstrated high discriminative ability, with a C-index of 0.932 in the derivation cohort and 0.934 in external validation.ConclusionThis study provides the first validated tool for early risk stratification in SWAS-associated SeLECTS, enabling clinicians to anticipate EE-SWAS progression and optimize therapeutic strategies. The model\u2019s robustness supports its potential utility in clinical decision-making to mitigate cognitive decline.",
