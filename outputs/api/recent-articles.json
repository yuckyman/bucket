      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>TermGPS is a terminal-based navigation application (TUI) that provides live turn-by-turn directions. It uses the `Rich` and `Textual` libraries to render a radar-style map, visual signal meters, and a &quot;Co-Pilot&quot; panel that detects your speed (`km/h`) and provides live commentary. It pulls routing data from the OSRM API and supports live GPS tracking (Native CoreLocation on macOS, IP-Geolocation fallback on Linux/Windows)</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is primarily a <strong>toy/hobby project</strong> for terminal enthusiasts, &quot;ricers&quot; (<a href=\"/r/unixporn\">r/unixporn</a> fans), and developers who want to stay inside their CLI. It is **not** meant for critical real-world navigation (e.g., flying a plane or medical transport) due to current API limitations, but it works great for general city navigation or just looking cool on your second monitor.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike `<strong>mapscii</strong>` (which is a telnet map viewer) or `<strong>google-maps-cli</strong>` (which often just opens a browser link), <strong>TermGPS</strong> is a fully interactive, native Python application that runs entirely in your terminal buffer. It doesn't just show a map; it calculates routes, tracks your real-time movement, and has a dedicated UI with themes (Matrix, Dracula, etc.).</p> <p>Repo &amp; Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Aditya-Giri-4356/termgps\">https://github.com/Aditya-Giri-4356/termgps</a></p> <p>(Note: Shows &quot;AI-Assisted&quot; in the repo because I pair-programmed this with an AI agent to test TUI rendering limits).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blah_4356\"> /u/blah_4356 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgx1v7/i_built_a_terminalbased_gps_with_turnbyturn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgx1v7/i_built_a_terminalbased_gps_with_turnbyturn/\">[comments]</a></span>",
