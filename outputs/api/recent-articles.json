      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID). However, its diagnostic rate needs to be improved by screening for specific populations. Here, we determined the genetic cause of three ID patients in the affected pedigree and derived diagnostic insights for FXS. Enrolled at Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital in April 2025, the family underwent multiple diagnostic tests. Whole-exome sequencing failed to detect causative variants\u2014consistent with its inability to identify dynamic trinucleotide repeat expansions. Expanded pedigree analysis showed the inheritance did not fit typical autosomal dominant/recessive or X-linked models. This raised suspicion of FXS. Trinucleotide repeat primed PCR with capillary electrophoresis (TP-PCR/CE) confirmed proband III-1 as an FXS full-mutation individual, and comprehensive FXS analysis (CAFXS) validated this result while identifying counselee III-2 as a female pre-mutation carrier. All three ID cases harbored FMR1 full-mutation, with ID severity correlating with CGG repeat length. Notably, the maternal pre-mutation carrier (152 CGG repeats) had offspring with variable repeat dynamics: full-mutation (427 repeats) and reduced pre-mutation (71 repeats in III-2). These findings confirm FXS as the ID etiology and emphasize the clinical necessity of FXS-targeted screening in ID families with atypical inheritance patterns.",

      "title": "Neural substrates of female sexual rejection: hypothalamic pathways to the periaqueductal gray",
      "content": "Selecting an appropriate behavioral response according to the internal state is essential for well-being. Across the reproductive cycle, fluctuating levels of sex hormones align female behavior with reproductive capacity by modulating neuronal circuits that express hormone receptors. Sex hormone receptor-expressing neurons present along the anterior-posterior axis of the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are key regulators of female sexual behavior. While posterior progesterone receptor-expressing neurons of the VMHvl (pVMHvlPR+) are fundamental for female sexual receptivity during the receptive phase of the reproductive cycle, we have recently shown that anterior VMHvlPR+ (aVMHvlPR+) neurons are involved in rejection behavior when non-receptive. Here, we mapped the connectional architecture of aVMHvlPR+ neurons using viral tracing approaches. As expected, these neurons strongly project to several hypothalamic areas. Furthermore, consistent with previous reports, we show that aVMHvlPR+ neurons robustly project to several columns of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) along its anterior-posterior axis. Artificial activation of aVMHvlPR+ somas selectively recruits the dorsomedial PAG (dmPAG). Optogenetic activation of aVMHvlPR+ axons in the dmPAG partially recapitulates the rejection phenotype observed upon activation of aVMHvlPR+ somas, increasing the rate of rejections in receptive females. These findings reveal a putative pathway regulating female rejection behavior within a more complex circuit, ensuring that mating does not occur during non fertile periods.",

      "content": "How does the developing brain, initially equipped only with elementary mathematical intuitions, acquire higher mathematical concepts? Through a longitudinal functional MRI study of children from preschool through first and second grade, we tracked how neural responses to mathematical and non-mathematical statements change in the first two years of formal schooling and use the data to evaluate several theories of developmental change. Before school, when listening to math statements, children already engage an adult-like cortical network, with partial specialization for geometry. Over the first two years of school, we observe an overall increase in math-related activation, a small recruitment of additional neural territory, reduced activation for facts that get better known, and a small overall increase in the dimensionality of representational space. fMRI responses to individual sentences suggest that these mechanisms, particularly in left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral intraparietal sulcus, all contribute to children's growing mastery of mathematical concepts.",

      "title": "Medication and Developmental Stage Shape the Brain-Age Gap in ADHD",
      "content": "Identifying robust biomarkers for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) remains challenging. The brain-age gap (BAG), which is the difference between predicted biological brain age and chronological age, has been proposed as a marker of atypical neurodevelopment, yet findings have been inconsistent across studies, limiting its clinical translation. We hypothesized that two major sources of heterogeneity, medication status and developmental stage, contribute to these discrepancies. To test this, we analyzed structural MRI data from a large multi-site cohort (N = 947; ages 7-26 years). Individuals with ADHD were stratified by medication history (medicated vs. unmedicated) and developmental stage (childhood vs. adolescence) and compared with matched typically developing controls. We estimated global- and network-level BAG using publicly available pretrained models. Our results revealed that BAG differences were contingent on medication status, with abnormalities predominantly observed in unmedicated individuals. Developmental stage further moderated the presence of this effect: BAG abnormalities were present significantly in children with ADHD but not in adolescents. Network-level analyses demonstrated spatial specificity, with significant effects in visual, ventral attention, and dorsal attention networks. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that BAG in ADHD is both medication- and development-dependent, highlighting the need to account for treatment exposure and developmental stage when evaluating BAG as a biomarker and further underscoring the importance of early intervention during childhood.",

      "title": "A computational neuroimaging account of impulsive premature decision-making",
      "content": "Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct with distinct implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders, behavioural addictions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, and personality disorders. One proposed behavioural subtype, premature responding impulsivity (PRI), appears to be influenced by neuromodulatory pathways frequently implicated in these disorders, in particular dopamine neurotransmission, known for its role in contingency learning. Still, the neurobiological basis of PRI in humans remains insufficiently understood. Here, we theorize that PRI reflects the brain's capacity to adapt to environmental uncertainty. To test this hypothesis, twenty-four healthy adults (mean age 22.6 years; 12 females) completed a novel decision-making task featuring alternating stable and volatile probabilistic cue contingencies while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A hierarchical Bayesian model estimated PRI as an urgency-to-respond process, whose parameters were dynamically modulated by volatility. These model-derived indices correlated with established trait impulsivity measures, supporting their construct validity. Model-based fMRI analyses identified a distributed cortico-subcortical network including anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and monoaminergic midbrain regions, whose activity tracked within-trial PRI estimates as they evolved over time. Connectivity analyses further showed that high volatility enhanced interactions between subnetworks typically associated with promoting or inhibiting impulsive action. Together, these results outline a neurocomputational account in which environmental uncertainty modulates PRI through interacting brain circuits, offering a principled framework for further probing the transdiagnostic role of impulsivity across neuropsychiatric and neuropsychopharmacological contexts.",

      "title": "Anterior cingulate cortex activation of claustrum projection neuron subtypes is enhanced by alcohol",
      "content": "Cognitive impairment is a major component of Alcohol Use Disorder. Optimal cognitive performance requires anterior cingulate input activation of the claustrum, a subcortical nucleus that orchestrates cortical activity. Yet the impact of chronic alcohol exposure on the ability for the anterior cingulate cortex to drive activity of claustrum projection neuron subtypes is unknown. In adult male and female mice, we found that the majority of non-burst firing Type 1 claustrum projection neurons did not express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), while the majority of burst firing Type 2 projection neurons were VGLUT2-expressing. Following chronic intermittent vaporized ethanol exposure (CIE), we found that both Type 1 and VGLUT2-non-expressing neurons exhibited increased responsivity to anterior cingulate cortex input activation that was mediated by increased postsynaptic membrane excitability. In contrast, Type 2 and VGLUT2-expressing projection neurons exhibited increased responsivity to anterior cingulate cortex input due to strengthened pre- and post-synaptic transmission mechanisms. Altogether, we uncovered a hyper-excitatory drive of the claustrum by the anterior cingulate cortex following chronic alcohol exposure. The data provide a foundational resource for the complex effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the claustrum, a critical cognitive control nucleus.",

      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",
