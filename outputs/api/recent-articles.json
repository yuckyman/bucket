      "title": "Fast Optimization of Robust Transcriptomics Embeddings using Probabilistic Inference Autoencoder Networks for multi-Omics",
      "content": "Advances in single-cell genomics technologies enable the routine acquisition of atlases with millions of cells. These datasets often include multiple sources of variation, such as donors, sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species. Although these covariates provide new opportunities for discovery, they also present challenges for downstream analyses. To mitigate unwanted sources of variation, dataset integration is the starting point for most analyses. However, existing methods struggle with integrating large and complex datasets. To address these limitations, we developed PIANO, a variational autoencoder framework that uses a negative binomial generalized linear model for stronger batch correction, and code compilation for up to ten times faster training than existing tools. We first demonstrate performant integration compared to commonly used integration methods on single-species datasets. We then show PIANO enables superior analyses of multiple atlases, solving challenging integration tasks across sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species, while simultaneously preserving desired biological signals. Our contributions include a novel, high-performance integration method and recommendations for integration applications.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

Embodied cognition provides a framework for understanding how cognitive and emotional processes shape L2 expression.ObjectiveThis study examined how immersive language experience influences pragmatic adaptation through the vocal expression of affect and physiological arousal in Chinese ESL learners.MethodsAcoustic analysis and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements were used to assess affectively valenced word production in speakers with varying levels of immersive English experience.ResultsHigh-immersion speakers exhibited greater pitch, intensity, and duration variation, enhancing emotional expressivity. Low-immersion speakers showed constrained vocal patterns and significantly higher physiological arousal, likely due to increased cognitive demands and anxiety.DiscussionThese findings highlight the impact of L2 proficiency on affective language embodiment and the cognitive challenges faced by L2 learners. This study offers novel insights by considering a pictorial character-based language, broadening our understanding of emotion-language interaction. Findings have implications for second-language education, cross-cultural communication, and bilingual speech therapy.",

      "title": "Cochlear histopathology in macaques after noise-induced temporary threshold shifts",
      "content": "Noise exposures causing transient hearing loss were previously considered benign. However, recent work has revealed that temporary noise-induced threshold shifts may be associated with long-lasting cochlear histopathology. One such effect is cochlear synaptopathy, i.e. changes to the afferent synapse between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Noise-induced synaptopathy has been extensively characterized in several rodent models, and temporal bone studies suggest similar age-related changes in humans. However, it remains unclear how noise-induced temporary threshold shifts affect cochlear structures in humans and nonhuman primates, which show greater resistance to noise exposure than other animals. Additionally, the long-term sequelae of temporary threshold shifts are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the effects of a noise exposure causing temporary hearing loss on cochlear histopathology in macaque monkeys at long post-exposure survival times. Overall, cochlear histopathology was variable across subjects, similar to the variable susceptibility observed in humans. At 2 and 10 months post-exposure, macaques had no significant loss of hair cells, inner hair cell synapses, or cholinergic efferent innervation. However, enlargement of ribbons in both inner and outer hair cells was observed. Together, these findings provide insight into the cochlear effects of single-exposure temporary threshold shifts in nonhuman primates.",

      "content": "Brainstem vestibulospinal (VS) nuclei generate excitatory commands in response to multi-modality sensory integration, to activate specific spinal networks in order to generate adapted postural reflexes. Comparably organized in bilateral nuclei with both ipsi- and contralateral pathways in all species, excitatory VS projections alone fail to explain the mostly unilateral reflex responses typically observed. In the Xenopus laevis tadpole, we describe secondary vestibular neurons of inhibitory nature, and the synaptic contacts they make on VS neurons. Then, using a brainstem/spinal cord in vitro preparation we show that the spinal responses evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation are shaped by both commissural and local inhibitory brainstem networks. We further show that a complex interaction between GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory networks regulate VS neuron excitability and, consequently, the expression of the spinal response. Our data reveal that while excitatory VS neurons execute the neural score, inhibitory neurons in the central vestibular system coordinate and modulate the overall performance.",

      "title": "No Evidence for Stronger Brain-Behavior Associations in the Bimanual Motor Network of Older Adults",
      "content": "Bimanual motor performance declines with age, is accompanied by cortical thinning and alterations in white matter microstructure within motor control networks. Aging is also associated with increased interindividual variability in behavioural and structural markers, and some studies report stronger brain-behaviour associations in older compared to younger adults. However, evidence for this remains mixed, and it is unclear whether young adults express similar relationships under comparable task demands. We tested whether bimanual performance is related differently to structural brain properties in younger and older adults. Twenty-three younger (22-27 years) and twenty-three older adults (65-70 years) performed a visually guided bimanual pinch-force task and underwent whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and cortical thickness (CTh) were extracted from a pre-defined bilateral visuo-motor network and compared between groups. In regions showing significant age-related differences, we tested whether and how FA and CTh values correlates with bimanual performance within each age group. Older adults showed lower FA in the anterior portions of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) III and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and lower CTh across most visuomotor regions, along with lower bimanual performance compared to young adults. Structure-function analyses in these areas revealed that bimanual performance correlated positively with FA in the anterior segment of the right SLF III in younger but not older adults. Furthermore, larger hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness between the dominant and non-dominant SMA correlated positively with larger intermanual performance differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand in younger but not older adults. These findings suggest that intrahemispheric white-matter integrity and interhemispheric cortical balance support efficient bimanual control in early adulthood, but they provide no evidence that structure-function relationships increase with age.",

      "title": "Spontaneous otocoherence of the active ear",
      "content": "Spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) provides compelling evidence of active force generation inside the inner ear, although there is significant debate about the underlying generation mechanism(s). SOAE is commonly characterized by peaks in a spectral domain representation (as derived from a discrete Fourier transform), occurring at idiosyncratic frequencies unique to a given ear. Such is typically computed as an averaged magnitude spectrum that discards phase information. Here, we explore the hypothesis that SOAE phase, readily extracted from pre-existing recordings, contains complementary information. We propose several measures to use this information to quantify otocoherence (a form of autocoherence referring to a phenomenon of the ear), primarily by measuring the consistency in SOAE phase accumulation over a particular timescale. We present results based on recordings from different species with disparate inner ear morphologies (humans, barn owls, lizards). For regions of SOAE activity we extract time constants representing the timescale over which otocoherence is maintained. We demonstrate that these vary significantly across species and (for the barn owl and Tokay gecko where this data is available) appear to correlate with measures of auditory nerve fiber tuning. Additionally, we adapted the method to identify regions of weak SOAE activity among fluctuations in the noise floor. These methods can readily be employed to re-analyze SOAE waveforms previously collected from a variety of species, making them of broader comparative utility to reveal information about SOAE generation and thereby active cochlear mechanics.",

      "title": "Locus Coeruleus alpha-Synuclein Overexpression Induces Prodromal Parkinsonian Features in Mice",
      "content": "The locus coeruleus is one of the first brain regions to develop alpha-synuclein pathology during the prodromal phase of Parkinson Disease, contributing significantly to non-motor symptoms such as cognitive decline, mood alterations or sleep disturbances. However, the precise role of the locus coeruleus in the early stages of the disease remains unclear. To address this, we developed and characterized a novel mouse model based on the PRSx8-driven overexpression of human alpha-synuclein in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus using an adeno-associated viral vector. Animals were assessed at 1 and 3 months post-injection using an integrated battery of histological, behavioural, neurochemical, and electrophysiological analyses. We observed robust accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the locus coeruleus, along with widespread propagation to projection areas, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe. Despite the absence of neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus, we identified reduced noradrenergic axonal integrity and marked decreases in both noradrenaline and serotonin levels, highlighting a disruption of neurochemical balance at an early stage. The electrophysiological data revealed transient alterations in the excitability and intrinsic properties of locus coeruleus neurons in a sex-dependent manner, suggesting that alpha-synuclein pathology induces early functional disruption prior to overt neurodegeneration. Behavioural outcomes demonstrated selective cognitive deficits and mild anxiety-like behaviours, while other non-motor functions remained preserved. Importantly, although several pathological and functional alterations were evident in the initial phases, behavioural impairments were also maintained at later time points, indicating that locus coeruleus-driven pathology exerts long-lasting consequences. Interestingly, female mice exhibited colon shortening, providing evidence of a sex-specific pathological process at the level of the gut-brain axis. We believe that this model accurately replicates key prodromal features of Parkinson disease, demonstrating that alpha-synuclein-induced pathology in the locus coeruleus leads to functional circuit impairment and cognitive decline. Our findings emphasize the locus coeruleus as a critical site of early vulnerability in Parkinson Disease and underscore the importance of sex as a biological variable influencing disease progression and therapeutic response.",

      "title": "Cortical response to balance perturbation is more sensitive in modern dancers than nondancers during biomechanically similar balance recovery",
      "content": "Motor skill expertise can facilitate more automatic movement, engaging less cortical activity while producing appropriate motor output. Accordingly, cortical-evoked N1 responses to balance perturbation, assessed using electroencephalography (EEG), are smaller in young and older adults with better balance. These responses may thus reflect individual balance challenge versus functional, or objective, task difficulty. However, the effect of balance expertise on cortical responses to balance perturbation has not been studied. We hypothesized that balance ability gained though long-term training facilitates more automatic balance control. Using professional modern dancers as balance experts, we compared cortical-evoked responses and biomechanics of the balance-correcting response between modern dancers and nondancers. We predicted that modern dancers would have smaller cortical-evoked responses and better balance recovery at equivalent levels of balance challenge. Support-surface perturbations were normalized to individual challenge levels by delivering perturbations scaled to 60% and 140% of each individual's step threshold. In contrast to our prediction, dancers exhibited larger N1 responses compared to nondancers while demonstrating similar biomechanical responses. Our results suggest dancers have greater cortical sensitivity to balance perturbations than nondancers. Further, dancer N1 responses modulated across perturbation magnitudes according to differences in objective task difficulty. In contrast, nondancer N1 responses modulated as a function of individual challenge level. Our findings suggest dance training increases sensitivity of the initial, cortical N1 response to balance perturbation, supporting postural alignment to an objective reference. The N1 response may reflect differences in balance-error processing that are altered with specific long-term training and may have implications for rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Live longitudinal imaging of meningeal cerebrovascular injury and its sequelae in adult zebrafish",
      "content": "Nearly 1.4 million people in the United States sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, with almost half of those hospitalized for TBI developing long-term disability. For many patients, prolonged bleeding and inflammation from damaged vessels in the meninges result in long-lasting sequelae. Although their injured blood vessels regrow, the site of injury is full of inflammatory immune cells that may influence vascular function. Adult zebrafish have a thin, translucent skull and a mammalian-like meninges that is easily imaged in living animals. We have established a novel adult zebrafish model to investigate vessel-immune cell interactions after meningeal cerebrovascular injury (mCVI). We use carefully calibrated sonication to rupture meningeal blood vessels without breaching the skull or causing damage to the underlying brain. By performing longitudinal live imaging of intubated adult fish we observe vascular regrowth and immune responses to mCVI over time in the same animal with unprecedented resolution allowing measurement of blood flow, dynamics of vessel regrowth, and interactions between individual immune and vascular cells. This newly developed zebrafish model provides a powerful tool for longitudinal live imaging of meningeal immune cell-vascular interactions after cerebrovascular injury, opening the door to new insights into chronic neuroinflammatory disease.",

      "title": "Inhibition governs stimulus preference encoding in mPFC pyramidal neurons during a social choice",
      "content": "Social decision-making requires the brain to continuously evaluate competing options and select appropriate actions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in social cognition and value-based decision-making, yet the neural mechanisms by which it encodes the relative value of competing social choices remain poorly understood. Here, we employed fiber photometry, optogenetics, and projection-specific recordings in mice performing four distinct binary social discrimination tasks to reveal how mPFC pyramidal neurons encode social choice. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons exhibit profound inhibition during bouts toward the preferred stimulus. This inhibitory response was specific to transitional bouts, when animals switched between stimuli, and was absent during non-transitional bouts, which occurred during continued engagement with the same stimulus. Notably, this differential activity encoded relative rather than absolute stimulus value, such that the same stimulus evoked opposite neural responses depending on its contextual preference. Accordingly, manipulating the subject's preference between food and social stimuli via food deprivation inverted its inhibition-excitation pattern. Furthermore, negative calcium transients in the mPFC predicted subsequent investigation of the preferred stimulus, suggesting a functional role in guiding behavioral choice. Optogenetic activation of mPFC pyramidal neurons during stimulus investigation produced immediate aversion yet paradoxically biased the stimulated animal to persistently re-engage with the stimulus-associated option through repetitive non-transitional bouts. Finally, projection-specific recordings revealed that mPFC neurons targeting the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala were differentially recruited across tasks, reflecting functional specialization of output pathways. Together, these findings identify inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons as a key neural signature for encoding relative stimulus preference, thereby establishing a neural principle by which the mPFC dynamically guides social choice.",

      "title": "Transcranial Static Magnetic Stimulation Dissociates the Causal Roles of the Parietal Cortex in Spatial and Temporal Processing",
      "content": "Accurate time estimation is essential for optimizing our perception and actions. Previous neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have suggested that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and supplementary motor area (SMA) are involved in time perception. However, it remains inconclusive whether the activity in these regions is crucial for time perception, partly due to the possible spread of TMS effects across anatomically connected brain regions. Such a remote effect is less likely to happen with transcranial static magnet stimulation (tSMS), as the static magnetic field is expected to modulate the firing threshold of neurons rather than directly triggering an action potential. In this study, we aimed to determine the causal relevance of local activities in the right IPL and the SMA for temporal processing using tSMS. We measured duration discrimination thresholds, along with orientation discrimination thresholds as a control, using staircase methods before and during the administration of tSMS over the IPL/SMA. Our results indicated no significant changes in duration discrimination thresholds in either the IPL or SMA conditions. In contrast, we observed an improvement in orientation discrimination thresholds in the IPL condition. This improvement correlated with individual differences in the distance between the scalp and the IPL. Overall, our findings demonstrate a causal involvement of the IPL in orientation processing. The correlation between the effects of tSMS and the scalp-to-target distance suggests that the efficacy of tSMS may be sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field.",

      "content": "The initial therapeutic exposure to DBS during implantation surgery has reproducible acute behavioral effects that carry over without further stimulation. We analyzed LFP data from the first month following brief therapeutic intraoperative DBS. Data were recorded from the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC). During this month no further stimulation was applied. Recent studies have identified beta power fluctuations in LFP data as an acute putative depression biomarker of this exposure. However, a detailed description of neural dynamics underlying brain power fluctuations is missing. Here, we provide a proof of principle study that these dynamics can be described using two new dynamical systems measures: instability frequency and relative wandering time. These capture interactions between neural activity and the mesoscale oscillatory electric fields generated by it. The two measures seem to split low vs. high HDRS scores within a small patient cohort. They are motivated by the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis, that suggests that efficient information processing results from mesoscale electric fields; and that the re-emergence of depression symptoms might result from altered electric fields. Whether the new measures reflect general mechanisms of rapid antidepressant action remains to be tested.",
