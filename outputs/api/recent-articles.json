      "title": "Calibration of MRI-based reference intervals to new samples",
      "content": "Reference intervals, defined as intervals containing a new observation with a specified probability relative to reference data, would be clinically useful in assessing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain charts, which are estimates of MRI phenotypes across covariates such as age and sex, can be used to construct reference intervals. However, the reference data used to fit intervals often differs from a new sample in terms of study design, MRI acquisition, and image preprocessing. Application of MRI reference intervals to new samples remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method called Reference interval calibration via conFormal prediction (ReForm) that adjusts reference intervals for a new sample. Our method builds on recent work in conformal prediction, which yields intervals with guaranteed coverage for new observations. Through resampling experiments in Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium cortical thickness data, we compare ReFormed reference intervals to refitting intervals, statistical harmonization methods, and model-based adjustment of intervals. Notably for patient privacy concerns, ReForm does not require sharing of reference data. Yet, our empirical results demonstrate that ReForm controls FPR similarly or better than alternative methods which require sharing reference data. Finally, we provide recommendations for practical applications of ReForm and an R package (https://github.com/andy1764/ReForm) for calibrating reference intervals using ReForm.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Neural heterogeneity as a unifying mechanism for efficient learning in spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "content": "Lesion-deficit mapping is a premier technique for dissociating neural correlates of cognitive functions. However, the contribution of domain-general cognition (g) to the performance of virtually all complex behavioral tasks may encumber such efforts. This possibility has been largely unexplored. Here, we examined the influence of g in lesion-deficit mapping using a combination of structural equation modeling, lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), and structural (sLNM) and functional (fLNM) lesion network mapping. We modeled latent variables for visuospatial ability, processing speed, language, and anterograde memory among 473 patients with focal brain damage (age range 20-93, 257 men, 216 women), both with and without g-associated variance embedded within each factor. Lesion-deficit maps for domain-specific cognitive abilities were statistically significantly less spatially inter-correlated after partitioning out g (p = 0.010 for LBM; p = 0.003 for sLNM; p = 0.003 for fLNM). Lesion-deficit maps also implicated the existence of distinct neuroanatomy for specific cognitive domains that was, in many cases, only apparent and clearly distinct from lesion-deficit maps of g after partitioning out the influence of g. Overall, our findings suggest that, if left unaccounted for, domain-general cognitive variance could tangibly affect conclusions about the extent to which different cognitive functions rely on distinct neuroanatomy.",

      "title": "Data-driven Cognitive Clusters in Persistent Developmental Dyslexia",
      "content": "Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent reading difficulties despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. The cognitive underpinnings of dyslexia remain incompletely understood. Although multiple causal pathways have been proposed, there is a gap in studies that can reliably identify dyslexia subtypes based on comprehensive evaluations that go beyond measures of reading and phonology. We employed one of the largest detailed samples of children with developmental dyslexia resistant to intervention, consisting of 147 extensively phenotyped school-age children aged 7-14 years who were recruited from specialized schools for students with learning differences. We implemented data-driven analyses leveraging a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to delineate cognitive subdomains and characterize the heterogeneity in the sample. Hierarchical clustering of 24 cognitive measures aided in constructing a framework to subsequently interpret emerging clusters. Four clusters emerged, predominantly associated with: Processing Speed & Executive Function, Visuospatial & Mathematical Reasoning, Phonological Manipulation, and Verbal Short-term Memory & Word Retrieval. Subsequent latent profile analysis identified two distinct dyslexia profiles: one characterized by marked difficulties in executive functioning and processing speed, and another displaying impairments primarily in verbal short-term memory and word retrieval relative to the other profile. Importantly, both profiles exhibited comparable severity of persistent reading difficulties despite their divergent cognitive profiles. These findings show that phenotypically similar reading impairments can arise from distinct underlying cognitive factors, emphasizing the role of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in developing tailored interventions for affected children.",

      "title": "Modelling mental disorders in zebrafish. Neurexins severely modulate anxiety, social behaviours and aggression.",
      "content": "Can we reproduce mental disorders in zebrafish? To explore this question, we manipulated the neurexin gene family. Neurexin (nrxn) genes encode synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that have been repetitively associated with neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. While the zebrafish animal model offers tremendous advantages for dissecting neural development/function, no robust nrxn zebrafish models are currently available. In this study, we generated the first collection of zebrafish knockout lines for each nrxn gene, with mutations ranging from transmembrane domain- to full genomic locus-deletions. Surprisingly, all homozygous lines developed normally, presenting no gross neurodevelopmental or obvious early behavioural abnormalities. However, this absence of early phenotypes translated into profound, paralog-specific behavioural alterations emerging during juvenile-to-adult stages. All neurexin knockouts affected mating behaviour, complicating the generation and maintenance of homozygous lines. Except for this shared behavioural alteration, nrxn1, but not nrxn2 or nrxn3, led to marked changes in social behaviour and aggression. In contrast, nrxn2 mutants exhibited severe anxiety-like behaviours, including bottom-dwelling and repetitive freezing/seizure events. Strikingly, nrxn1 full-locus deletion mutants showed opposing behaviour, spending most of their time near the surface. The two also displayed opposite responses to open/closed field transitions; confinement alleviated nrxn2 anxiety but enhanced nrxn1 surface-dwelling. Meanwhile, nrxn3 mutants behaved normally in all our initial tests. In summary, our study introduces a complete set of zebrafish mutants covering the whole nrxn gene family, presenting striking juvenile/adult behavioural alterations despite the absence of noticeable early defects; echoing the delayed onset of human psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. This work demonstrates the value of zebrafish to study mental disorders and unlock a novel platform to unravel the pathogenic contribution of neurexin and associated subtle neurodevelopmental changes/timing that drive the emergence of mental illnesses.",

      "title": "Understanding cortical computation through the lens of joint-embedding predictive architectures",
      "content": "Tracking prey or recognizing a lurking predator is as crucial for survival as anticipating their actions. To guide behavior, the brain must extract information about object identities and their dynamics from entangled sensory inputs. How it accomplishes this feat remains an open question. Predictive coding theories propose that this ability arises by comparing predicted sensory signals with actual inputs and reducing the associated prediction errors. However, existing models rely on generative architectures that compute prediction errors directly in the input space, which is hard to reconcile with neural anatomy. Here, we develop a theory that avoids this issue by operating solely on internal representations. Specifically, we introduce recurrent predictive learning (RPL), a recurrent joint-embedding predictive architecture inspired by self-supervised machine learning, that learns abstract representations of object identity and their dynamics and predicts future object motion. Crucially, the model learns sequence representations that resemble successor-like representations observed in the primary visual cortex of humans. The model also develops abstract sequence representations comparable to those reported in the macaque prefrontal cortex. Finally, we outline how RPL's modular feedforward-recurrent organization could map onto canonical cortical microcircuits as a plausible model of cortical representation learning. Our work establishes a circuit-centric theory framework that unifies predictive processing with self-supervised learning, providing a fresh perspective on how the brain acquires an internal model of the world.",

      "title": "Synaptic MEMOIR: mapping individual synapses of neurons with protein barcodes",
      "content": "Obtaining wiring diagrams of brains has been a major achievement for neuroscience. However, an underlying challenge in connectomics is the fundamental tradeoff between the imaging resolution needed to resolve synapses and the volume of the brain that can be imaged. For example, electron microscopy (EM) visualizes synaptic sites with ~5 nm resolution, but is difficult to scale beyond volumes of 1 mm3. Here, we present Synaptic MEMOIR (Memory with Engineered Mutagenesis with Optical in situ Readout) that enables imaging of neuronal projections in animal brains with single-synapse resolution. Synaptic MEMOIR is built around three key design features. First, protein barcodes are transported to synapses to allow matching of synaptic barcodes to cell body barcodes without high resolution imaging and the error-prone process of tracing neuronal processes across long distances. Second, Synaptic MEMOIR uses continuous mutagenesis to generate a large diversity of barcodes to uniquely label cell bodies and synapses. Last, the timing of recombination and transport can be tuned to record synaptic age or projection information. Combining these features, we demonstrated projection mapping of 113 neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe in a volume of 9.5 million m3. Because synapses are identified by transported barcodes with optical microscopy at 300 nm resolution, this approach can potentially scale to much larger volumes, similar at least to those imaged in recent mouse brain transcriptomics atlases. In addition, synaptic MEMOIR can match barcodes across brain sections, and does not require tissue clearing to track long-range projections. Together, these results provide the foundation for a scalable optical image-based system for reconstructing the neural wiring diagrams of brains across different developmental stages, genetic backgrounds and perturbations.",
