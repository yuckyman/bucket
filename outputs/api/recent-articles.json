      "title": "Neural Entrainment in the Theta Band Predicts Groove Perception in Popular Music",
      "content": "When humans listen to popular music, they often feel 'the groove', which is a pleasurable urge to move along with music. Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brain's entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals' groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatio-temporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence. Our results support the theory that the perception of groove is rooted in the brain's ability to entrain to ongoing dynamic temporal structures of music in the theta band. They further show that multivariate decoding models can be leveraged to predict subjective groove online from neural entrainment with high accuracy and temporal resolution. Summary - While participants (n = 30) rated their subjective groove perception of 9 popular songs and 12 MIDI clapping rhythms, we measured how their brains entrained to these musical stimuli using stimulus-brain coherence (SBC) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measures. - Both stimulus types strongly entrained delta-theta (1-7 Hz) oscillations. In univariate analyses, also both stimulus types at fronto-central, beat-related frequencies significantly predicted groove ratings. - Multivariate decoding using EEG entrainment patterns predicted individual groove ratings far better (up to Pearson r = 0.8), with combined ITPC patterns providing the most information.",

      "title": "Old-New Recognition Memory Revisited",
      "content": "Identifying old items during recognition memory tasks elicits widespread cortical responses. Recent results suggest that a distributed network, labeled the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), responds to old items, potentially reflecting mnemonic familiarity. An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here, we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity. These results revise our understanding of brain networks contributing to old-new recognition separating component processes common to many forms of target detection task from processes preferentially associated with mnemonic history.",

      "title": "Cell-type-resolved NRXN1 isoforms across human brain tissues and hiPSC organoids",
      "content": "NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing that generates a highly diverse repertoire of isoforms, diversifying protein-protein interactions, shaping synaptic specialization, and contributing to neuropsychiatric disease when disrupted. However, the splicing landscape of NRXN1 across distinct human brain cell types remains poorly defined. Because NRXN1 expression level is relatively low in adult brains and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons, single-cell Iso-seq RNA sequencing often provides insufficient coverage to capture its full isoform diversity, particularly across heterogeneous cell populations. To address this gap, we developed an integrative sequencing strategy that combines single-cell transcriptomics, targeted enrichment of NRXN1 transcripts, and long-read sequencing. This approach reveals a comprehensive catalog of cell-type resolved NRXN1 isoforms across adult and fetal human postmortem brains as well as hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. From the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) region, our analyses reveal distinct splicing programs across interneuron subtypes, pyramidal neurons, and glial lineages. Comparisons between prenatal and adult brains indicate that NRXN1 isoform profiles are established during early development and remain stable throughout neuronal maturation. In hiPSC organoid models, splicing profiles partially mirror both developmental and mature brain patterns, with a subset of splice sites exhibiting cell type- and stage-specific divergence. In the cerebellum of an autism case and in organoids derived from schizophrenia patients, carrying non-recurrent heterozygous NRXN1 deletions, we identify disrupted isoform expression and mutant NRXN1alpha; isoforms and characterize their distribution across diverse cell types. These findings help understand the complex alternative splicing of NRXN1 in adult human brain and hiPSC-derived models and establish a framework for decoding cell type-specific isoform diversity for important genes with relatively low gene expression levels.",

      "title": "The Cerebellum Implements an Oscillatory Forward Model for Accurate Motor Timing",
      "content": "Voluntary movements are composed of small sub-movements generated by pulsatile bursts of muscle activity at 4-10 Hz. These motor intermittencies synchronize with rhythmic brain activity and vary with movement velocity and sensory delays, suggesting they are a signature of a central oscillatory motor control mechanism. We hypothesized that these pulsatile movements arise from a cerebellar clocking mechanism- a neuronal timing process that flexibly adjusts its dynamics to maintain motor precision under temporal uncertainty. If so, cerebellar rhythms should modulate their influence on movement depending on cue predictability. To test this, we used optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), which enables high quality, movement tolerant recordings of the brain with dense cerebellar coverage. Six participants performed an auditory paced finger flexion-extension task at approximately 1 Hz with either regular or irregular cue timing to vary predictability. All participants exhibited clear 4-10 Hz intermittencies in their kinematics, synchronized to neural activity in the cerebellum and the posterior parietal cortex. Our connectivity analysis revealed for the first time, that cerebellar activity at this frequency, predominantly reflects sensory feedback, but during regular, predictable cueing, the cerebellum shifts to exert a greater feedforward influence on movement. Moreover, cerebellar oscillations were most persistently phase-aligned with motor intermittent rhythms during accurately timed actions, an effect that was absent under irregular cueing. These findings support the idea that the cerebellum implements an oscillatory forward model for motor timing and provide novel evidence for its ability to adjusting its role in coordinating sensorimotor integration according to sensory predictability. Motor intermittencies may thus represent the output of a cerebellar timing process that underpins precise voluntary action.",

      "title": "Precision neurodiversity: personalized brain network architecture as a window into cognitive variability",
      "content": "Precision neurodiversity marks a shift in neuroscience from pathological models to personalized frameworks that view neurological differences as adaptive variations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation. The convergence of advanced neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine offers unprecedented opportunities for tailored interventions, while celebrating neurological diversity as a source of human strength.",

      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "Development and validation of a predictive nomogram for cerebral white matter hyperintensities: insights from a comprehensive clinical and laboratory analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), associated with cognitive decline and stroke risk. An accurate predictive model is needed for early risk assessment.MethodsThis retrospective study utilized data from 587 patients undergoing cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Hebei University\u2019s Neurology Department. A predictive model for WMH was developed using a combination of clinical and laboratory parameters through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and binary logistic regression analysis. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsKey predictors included age, history of stroke, hypertension, triiodothyronine levels, albumin- globulin ratio, and homocysteine. The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI: 0.738\u20130.829) in the training cohort and 0.762 (95% CI: 0.690\u20130.834) in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA confirmed the model\u2019s clinical applicability.ConclusionThis study presents a validated nomogram for predicting WMH, integrating clinical and biochemical markers. The model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy and potential for early risk stratification. Future studies should focus on multi-center validation and expanded risk factor inclusion.",

      "title": "Are emojis better? The impact of generative AI emoji cues and service outcomes on user satisfaction: evidence from ERPs",
      "content": "To promote the sustainable development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications in the service industry, enhancing user satisfaction is key. Emojis serve as catalysts for conveying emotions and enhancing user experience in online communication. However, due to the black-box nature and unpredictability of GenAI, service providers find it challenging to control the boundaries of their application. Currently, there is ongoing debate within the academic community regarding the use of emojis in GenAI, particularly concerning emotional manipulation and experience enhancement, with further exploration needed into their effectiveness and underlying mechanisms. This study is based on the emotion as social information model and employs event-related potential (ERP) technology with high temporal resolution, which is more suitable for GenAI interaction scenarios. By measuring users\u2019 immediate cognitive processing and psychological activities, the study analyzes the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms through which emojis (presence vs. absence) and service outcomes (success vs. failure) influence user satisfaction. Behavioral results indicate that the outcome of GenAI services determines user satisfaction, while the presence or absence of emojis does not directly impact satisfaction. ERP results show that the presence of emojis compared to their absence triggers larger P3 amplitudes (emotional arousal) and N4 amplitudes (cognitive conflict); compared to service success, the presence of emojis during service failure triggers larger N4 amplitudes. This study reveals the complexity of user responses in real human-machine interaction environments, enriches research on the use of Emojis in GenAI, and provides scientific theoretical and practical foundations for GenAI design and enhancing user experience.",

      "title": "Case Report: Compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants in two siblings presenting with myoclonic epilepsy and ataxia",
      "content": "ObjectiveBiallelic variants in KCTD7 have been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset epilepsy, cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia.MethodsWhole-exome sequencing was first performed in the elder sister to identify candidate variants, followed by in silico pathogenicity prediction. Sanger sequencing was then used to validate the variants in both parents and the younger brother.ResultsWe report two siblings with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) carrying compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants: c.334C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg112Cys), a paternally inherited variant previously reported in homozygous form and currently classified as likely pathogenic, and c.640C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg214Trp), a novel maternally inherited variant currently classified as of uncertain significance. Both patients presented between 2 and 3\u202fyears of age with gait instability, myoclonic seizures, and developmental regression. EEG revealed background slowing, multifocal spike\u2013slow wave discharges, and electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Brain MRI findings were initially unremarkable despite progressive neurological deterioration. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger validation confirmed the variants and their segregation. In silico tools predicted both variants to be deleterious, and structural modeling using PyMOL and I-Mutant 3.0 demonstrated that both variants likely disrupt local residue interactions and reduce protein stability. Both patients received antiepileptic therapy and immunomodulatory treatment, including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. The proband achieved seizure control and improved gait following immunotherapy, though cognitive deficits persisted. The younger sibling exhibited a more severe disease course, with progressive cognitive decline, speech and visual impairment, and loss of independent ambulation, despite partial seizure control. These findings expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-related PME and suggest that immunotherapy may confer partial clinical benefit in selected cases.ConclusionThis case expands the variant spectrum of KCTD7-related disorders and emphasizes the utility of comprehensive genetic testing in early-onset neurodegenerative epileptic syndromes. Functional studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of the novel KCTD7 variant.",

      "title": "Multimodal neuroimaging of Col4a1-mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome",
      "content": "IntroductionCerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of stroke and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Studying monogenic forms of cSVD can elucidate molecular pathways that are dysfunctional in the common sporadic forms and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 cause highly penetrant cSVD as part of the multisystem disorder known as Gould syndrome, which includes cerebrovascular manifestations such as porencephaly, early-onset stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsTo investigate how allelic heterogeneity influences cerebrovascular phenotypes, we examined five Col4a1 mutant mouse strains that collectively model the clinical spectrum of Gould syndrome. Each strain underwent multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 14.1 Tesla to assess radiological features characteristic of cSVD.ResultsMultimodal MRI successfully identified typical cSVD-associated lesions across all Col4a1 mutant strains. The imaging revealed heterogeneous expressivity among the allelic variants in terms of lesion prevalence, size, and number. Furthermore, analysis across strains identified brain regions that were consistently more vulnerable to cSVD-related lesions.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that high-field multimodal MRI can sensitively detect and differentiate cerebrovascular abnormalities among Col4a1 mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome. The approach provides a powerful, noninvasive platform for assessing genotype\u2013phenotype relationships and for identifying brain regions at heightened risk in cSVD, supporting its potential use in early diagnosis and mechanistic studies of vascular pathology.",
