      "title": "Multi-model deep learning for dementia detection: addressing data and model limitations",
      "content": "IntroductionDeep neural network architectures have transformed medical imaging, particularly in structural MRI (sMRI) classification. However, existing state-of-the-art deep learning models face limitations in preprocessing and feature extraction when classifying dementia-related conditions. This study addresses these challenges by evaluating multiple architectures for dementia diagnosis.MethodsThis study assessed eight pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a Vision Transformer (ViT), a multimodal attention model, and a capsule network (CapsNet) for classifying three classes: dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls. The dataset, obtained from ADNI, was balanced across classes and comprised 10,000 training images per class, 3,000 validation images per class, and 850 test images per class. Classification was performed using 2D slices from sMRI scans. Performance metrics included accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.ResultsAmong all evaluated models, the 3D-CNN and multimodal attention models achieved the highest performance, with accuracies of 84% and 86%, specificities of 83% and 86%, and sensitivities of 84% and 86%, respectively. The ViT and CapsNet models achieved 100% sensitivity for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) but demonstrated low precision for AD (43%) and 0% for other classes, indicating class imbalance effects. All models showed reduced performance and bias toward certain classes.DiscussionThe findings highlight the limitations of current architectures in sMRI dementia classification, including suboptimal feature extraction and class-specific biases. While certain models, such as multimodal attention and 3D-CNN, performed better overall, precision and generalization remain challenges. Future work should focus on improved data representation through advanced computer vision methods and architectural modifications to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

      "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

      "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep stage classification via hybrid data distillation",
      "content": "Objective. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, more and more researchers have begun developing end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification frameworks. However, these frameworks typically require access to large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for training, which imposes a significant computational burden. Furthermore, EEG data contains patient privacy information, and using such data for training raises concerns about privacy infringement. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid data distillation method. We aim to enable single-channel EEG sleep stage classification with less training cost and privacy risk by distilling large real datasets into a tiny, privacy-preserving synthetic set for training from scratch. Approach. We first apply the gradient matching method to optimize the randomly initialized synthetic dataset. The gradient changes in the early stages of model training can quickly reduce the performance gap between the synthetic dataset and the source dataset. Subsequently, to avoid oscillations near the optimal solution during gradient matching, we switch to distribution matching to further optimize the synthetic dataset. This method aligns the data distribution at a global level, enhancing overall consistency. In addition, we adopt a novel mini-batch iteration method to assist the synthetic dataset in learning temporal dependencies. Main results. We validated our framework on three public datasets and achieved robust results. Significance. This study proposes an efficient and robust hybrid data distillation algorithm, providing a feasible approach for implementing sleep stage staging based on privacy protection.",

      "content": "Objective. As an emerging paradigm of brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), speech BCI has the potential to directly reflect auditory perception and thoughts, offering a promising communication alternative for patients with aphasia. Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. Approach. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Main results. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study on multi-modality assisted decoding for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs.",
