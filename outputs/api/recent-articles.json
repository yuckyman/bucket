      "title": "Integration of ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors in the ventral hippocampus",
      "content": "Anxiety is a complex emotional state that unfolds as structured sequences of risk assessment and exploratory behaviors enabling animals to evaluate potential threats in the environment. The ventral hippocampus (vH) regulates anxiety responses, yet the neuronal substrates orchestrating specific ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors remain unclear. Here, we combined high-resolution 3D behavioral tracking with cell-type specific in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations to dissect vH microcircuit dynamics during anxiety. We identified protected and unprotected stretch-attend postures (pSAP and uSAP), along with head dipping, as core anxiety-related risk-assessment behaviors organized along a spatial gradient in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Ventral hippocampal (vH) pyramidal neurons were broadly engaged across all risk-assessment behaviors, consistent with a generalized role in encoding anxiety-related information. In contrast, interneuronal subclasses exhibited striking functional specialization: parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were selectively recruited during uSAP and head dipping, behaviors associated with direct threat exposure, whereas somatostatin (Sst) interneurons were preferentially activated during pSAP, which reflect approach-avoidance conflicts and decision-making processes. Collectively, these findings establish a microcircuit-level framework in which distinct vH neuronal subclasses differentially gate risk-assessment strategies, enabling flexible transitions between avoidance and exploratory behaviors during anxiety.",

      "title": "Tractometry-Based Quantification of Along-Tract White-Matter Hemispheric Asymmetry in Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "White-matter hemispheric asymmetry is a fundamental property of human brain organization and is known to change in aging, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative disorders. Tractometry analyzes diffusion-derived microstructural measures along the full length of tracts, localizing changes to specific tract-segments rather than collapsing tracts into a single value. Yet, existing frameworks lack a principled way to quantify left-right hemispheric asymmetries along homologous tracts. Here, we introduce an asymmetry-aware tractometry framework that integrates a symmetric white-matter atlas with BUAN (Bundle Analytics) to enable anatomically consistent, along-tract comparison of homologous pathways. By defining homologous bundles with a shared template and consistent orientation, each left-hemisphere segment is directly matched to its right-hemisphere counterpart, enabling principled, segment-wise comparison and revealing spatially localized asymmetries along-tract. Applying this framework to diffusion MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprising 1,215 subjects, we demonstrate how this approach reveals systematic left-right asymmetries across major white-matter pathways and show how these patterns differentiate cognitively normal (CN) individuals from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This method provides a sensitive and anatomically grounded tool for studying hemispheric specialization and its disruption in aging and disease, and establishes a general approach for asymmetry-aware tractometry in population neuroimaging studies.",

      "title": "Dissociable neuronal substrates for positive and negative valence stimuli in the nucleus accumbens",
      "content": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) responds to both natural and artificial rewards and to aversive stimuli; however, it remains unclear whether these opposing valence signals engage distinct neuronal ensembles. Here we used Fos-CreERT2-based activity-dependent tagging to label NAc neuronal ensembles activated by cocaine or foot shock. We found that cocaine ensemble consisted predominantly of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), whereas foot shock ensemble similarly recruited D1- and D2-MSNs. One-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice revealed that acute cocaine primarily excited D1-MSNs while inhibiting the majority of D2-MSNs, whereas foot shock induced excitatory responses in both types of MSNs. Optogenetic reactivation of the cocaine-ensemble elicited a strong behavioural preference, whereas reactivation of the shock-ensemble produced no significant behavioural effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that cocaine recruits a functionally specific NAc ensemble distinct from that recruited by shock, providing mechanistic insight into the valence-specific neuronal substrates underlying reward and aversion processing.",
