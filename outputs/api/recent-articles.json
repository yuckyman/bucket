      "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

      "title": "Temporal Phase Differences Encode Tactile Motion from Static Vibrotactile Inputs",
      "content": "Motion perception in touch is traditionally attributed to spatially sequential stimulation or skin deformation caused by moving objects. Here, we demonstrate that directional tactile motion can instead be inferred purely from temporal phase differences between two spatially static vibrotactile inputs. Using psychophysical experiments in human participants (n = 54), we show that continuous vibrations delivered to separate fingertips, when offset in phase, evoke a robust and directionally consistent motion percept despite the absence of physical movement. Discrimination performance depended systematically on the temporal phase relationship between stimuli, following a sinusoidal relationship, consistent with a phase-based motion inference mechanism. Vibration amplitude had little influence on perceptual accuracy once stimuli exceeded detection threshold, although higher amplitudes modestly reduced response times. In contrast, envelope dynamics and spatial configuration significantly modulated performance: vibrations with exponential amplitude envelopes - reflecting the natural propagation of mechanical energy through a medium - enhanced phase sensitivity and sped responses, and bimanual stimulation across the two hands improved both accuracy and response time. These findings identify temporal phase integration as a fundamental mechanism for tactile motion perception, analogous to timing-based computations in auditory localisation and visual motion detection. Phase-coded vibrotactile stimulation therefore offers a minimal and efficient strategy for conveying directional motion in haptic interfaces without requiring spatial arrays or moving actuators.",

      "title": "Transcriptomic profiling reveals neurophysiological gene candidates underlying vocal evolution in African clawed frogs",
      "content": "Neurophysiologists have discovered many mechanisms underlying the production of animal behaviors in specific species; these involve a collection of neuromuscular systems, neuronal membrane and neural network properties, as well as the hormones and neuromodulators known to modify them. However, the mechanistic basis of behavioral evolution is less well-studied, and causal links between differences in gene expression, cellular mechanisms and species-typical behaviors are rare. Vertebrate vocal behaviors are an excellent system for studying the evolution of behaviors because they are ancient, diverse and readily quantifiable. Xenopus frogs are particularly well-suited to the study of vocal evolution due to the temporal diversity of male advertisement calls between closely related species and the well-described vocal pattern generating circuitry. Here we focus on two species, X. laevis and X. petersii, that diverged 8.5 million years ago and produce advertisement calls with distinct timing. To begin bridging the gap between behavioral and mechanistic diversity in Xenopus vocal behaviors, we performed RNA sequencing of the parabrachial nucleus, a vocal premotor hindbrain area known to encode species-typical temporal patterns in X. laevis and X. petersii. We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes between the two species, including many genes related to hormone signaling, neuromodulation, neuronal and synaptic functions, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. We explore several testable hypotheses emerging from these results that may explain mechanisms by which candidate genes and gene families may contribute to vocal pattern differences between X. laevis and X. petersii.",

      "title": "Opening the black box: a modular approach to spike sorting",
      "content": "Spike sorting is an algorithmic process to extract the activity of individual neurons from extracellular electrophysiology recordings. With the ballooning use of high density probes, such as Neuropixels, this essential processing step is increasingly becoming time consuming and computationally expensive. Although many software tools have been proposed to address spike sorting, they are usually constructed and benchmarked as monolithic 'black boxes', making it difficult to factor out the effects of individual algorithmic steps on the final outcome, especially when varying datasets and parameters. To address this issue, we developed a modular and common framework to develop, benchmark, and assemble the key computational steps that are used in state-of-the-art spike sorting algorithms. Relying on fast and efficient ground truth generation of biophysically plausible recordings, we show that we are able to individually benchmark and precisely quantify the performance of different steps in a spike sorting pipeline (peak detection, feature extraction and clustering, and template matching). We then leverage these results to create a modular component-based spike sorters that can outperform Kilosort4 on large and dense simulated recordings. In addition, we find that the major bottleneck of all modern spike sorting pipelines is in the physical motion of probes, regardless of the drift-correction strategy. The presented component-based spike sorting framework has the potential to foster community engagement in the field by lowering the barrier to contributions, and provides a flexible yet powerful framework to construct end-to-end spike sorting solutions.",

      "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early tau pathology in subcortical neuromodulatory nuclei, followed by progressive cortical tau accumulation; however, the mechanisms linking subcortical dysfunction to cortical tau pathology remain unclear. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from the ADNI cohort, we examined how infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain (i.e., gBOLD) activity is related to the volume of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and cortical tau accumulations in the early stages of AD. NbM degeneration was associated with reduced gBOLD activity and spatially co-localized tau accumulation, appearing in early Braak regions during the preclinical stage, i.e., cognitively unimpaired participants with abnormal CSF markers, and extending to more advanced Braak areas during the prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Our findings suggest that infra-slow gBOLD activity serves as a functional neural mediator linking subcortical degeneration to cortical tau pathology, highlighting a potential functional pathway linking subcortical and cortical pathology in early AD.",

      "content": "Multimodal data fusion is a powerful technique for extracting shared and complementary information about the brain that is captured across neuroimaging modalities. Independent component analysis (ICA)-based approaches are among the most widely utilized methods for multimodal fusion, as they are data-driven, robust to noise, and capable of identifying complex, hidden linkages of varying strengths across high-dimensional datasets. However, the data-driven nature of ICA fusion approaches can make comparisons across analyses difficult without a normative framework in place. In this work, we utilize resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) scans from >15,000 subjects to generate a normative model of multimodal structure-function linkages that can be used as a template to guide ICA fusions of new datasets. When applying this template in two datasets, resultant components exhibit high correspondence to the template even in small sample sizes, and subject-level loadings from template-derived ICs show significant associations to age.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Post-Decision Outcome Expectation and Evaluation in Human Sensorimotor Choice Behavior",
      "content": "The concept of embodied sensorimotor decision-making proposes that processes implicated in evaluating sensory inputs and selecting appropriate motor actions unfold partly in cortical regions traditionally associated with movement planning and execution. Reinforcement learning models emphasize the role of reward prediction error (RPE) in optimizing action selection based on decision outcome feedback. However, most evidence for the existence of RPE signals locates them in midline frontal and parietal cortex, and comes from tasks with externally manipulated reward probabilities that create artificial prediction errors. Whether RPE signals are expressed in human cortical motor areas during deterministic (non-probabilistic) tasks remains unclear, and would provide further support for embodied decision-making. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study post-decision neural dynamics in a color discrimination task in selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Participants had to press buttons with their left or right index finger in response to checkerboard stimuli with different levels of color evidence for the correct choice. Outcomes were fully determined by participants' choices. Delayed auditory feedback veridically indicated whether their hand choice was correct or not. We observed a robust beta-band (15-29 Hz) rebound after correct outcome feedback, strongest in ventral and dorsal premotor, anterior cingulate and superior parietal ROIs as well as occipital and auditory ROIs, and weakest in the primary motor and somatosensory ROIs. Critically, the rebound magnitude after correct feedback scaled inversely with color evidence strength and associated decision error rates. It was minimal in strong-evidence trials (~0.1% errors) and maximal in weak-evidence trials (~34% errors), resembling a context-sensitive positive RPE signal that was strongest when a correct outcome was least expected. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) post-feedback rebound increases in weak evidence trials were not as strong as in the beta band and appeared mainly in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. After the decision but before feedback, both beta and alpha band power showed sensitivity to the level of sensory evidence on which the decisions had been based, with reduced post-movement rebound or enhanced suppression in trials with weak evidence, suggestive of internally generated outcome expectations. Pre-feedback alpha rebound suppression was strongest in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. Pre-feedback beta rebound suppression was not as strong. Together, these findings reveal distinct beta- and alpha-band dynamics that reflect internal pre-feedback outcome expectations and feedback-driven RPE-like outcome assessments. They support distributed cortical mechanisms, including premotor, parietal and cingulate regions, in reward expectation, outcome evaluation, and adaptive control, highlighting a role for motor and associative cortices in embodied decision-making, performance monitoring, and flexible behavior under uncertainty.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is poorly understood and for which current treatments provide only modest control of symptoms. To better investigate the causes and progression of the disease, the transgenic TgF344-AD rat model has emerged as a crucial tool. In this paper, we collect observations on the accumulation of amyloid-{beta}, changes in neuronal density, and a decline in cognitive performance in TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. We develop a compartmental ordinary differential equation model and determine its parameters by fitting the output to the experimental observations. Our model simulations support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} leads to a rapid decline in neuronal density followed by a significant loss in memory and learning ability. Our mathematical model can provide a bridge between AD research in rodent models and the human condition of AD.",

      "title": "A Population Vector Model of Visual Working Memory for Real-World Scenes",
      "content": "Visual working memory is essential for navigating through and interacting with complex real-world environments. It is therefore important to understand how natural visual inputs - characterized by complex contours, continuously varying feature gradients, and spatial relationships - are represented in working memory. However, most research in this field has focused on simplified arrays of discrete artificial objects, favoring experimental control and modeling simplicity over ecological validity. This has led to quantitative models of working memory that require inputs consisting of easily parsed objects defined by a single value along one or more simple feature dimensions. It is not clear how these models could be updated to represent complex, photograph-like scenes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a population vector model of working memory that was designed specifically for real-world scenes. This model represents a scene as a noisy vector of neural firing rates across one or more areas of the ventral pathway, as estimated by a deep neural network model. We show that this model can account for both variations in behavioral performance and patterns of brain activity in tasks that require storing naturalistic scenes in working memory. These results demonstrate the viability of our general modeling approach, setting the stage for more sophisticated models that can fully account for the storage of real-world scenes in working memory.",

      "title": "History-dependent ephaptic interactions in paired olfactory receptor neurons",
      "content": "Olfactory sensing begins with the transduction of odors into receptor currents on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In insects and many other arthropods, ORNs are grouped stereotypically in hair-like sensilla on the surface of olfactory organs, enabling mutual inhibition through non-synaptic 'ephaptic' interactions (NSIs). Given the electrical, and therefore virtually instantaneous, nature of NSIs, it has been hypothesized that they contribute to processing fast temporal elements of mixed odor plumes. Here, we present single sensillum recordings and computational modeling that characterize NSIs during short offset dual-odor stimulations in the olfactory sensilla of adult female Drosophila melanogaster. We find in the experiments that the magnitude of inhibition between co-housed ORNs cannot be predicted by their instantaneous activity (firing rate) alone. It is adaptation-dependent, with strong effects only occurring when the inhibited ORN is adapted. This limits the usefulness of NSIs for fast odor processing when ORNs lack time to adapt. We reproduced the observed phenomena in a computational model and use this model to explain how the adaptation-dependence of NSI-mediated inhibition arises from nonlinearities in neural responses. We conclude that NSIs are unlikely to support the encoding of fast temporal dynamics in mixed odor stimuli, instead contributing to slower peripheral processing, supporting roles such as novelty detection. More broadly, we demonstrate how the nonlinear interactions of fairly simple electrical components lead to non-intuitive results, offering insight into the longstanding debate around ephaptic interactions in other systems, such as the mammalian CNS.",

      "title": "Show HN: Ourguide \u2013 OS wide task guidance system that shows you where to click",
      "content": "<p>Hey! I'm eshaan and I'm building Ourguide -an on-screen task guidance system that can show you where to click step-by-step when you need help.<p>I started building this because whenever I didn\u2019t know how to do something on my computer, I found myself constantly tabbing between chatbots and the app, pasting screenshots, and asking \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d Ourguide solves this with two modes. In Guide mode, the app overlays your screen and highlights the specific element to click next, eliminating the need to leave your current window. There is also Ask mode, which is a vision-integrated chat that captures your screen context\u2014which you can toggle on and off anytime -so you can ask, \"How do I fix this error?\" without having to explain what \"this\" is.<p>It\u2019s an Electron app that works OS-wide, is vision-based, and isn't restricted to the browser.<p>Figuring out how to show the user where to click was the hardest part of the process. I originally trained a computer vision model with 2300 screenshots to identify and segment all UI elements on a screen and used a VLM to find the correct icon to highlight. While this worked extremely well\u2014better than SOTA grounding models like UI Tars\u2014the latency was just too high. I'll be making that CV+VLM pipeline OSS soon, but for now, I\u2019ve resorted to a simpler implementation that achieves <1s latency.<p>You may ask: if I can show you where to click, why can't I just click too? While trying to build computer-use agents during my job in Palo Alto, I hit the core limitation of today\u2019s computer-use models where benchmarks hover in the mid-50% range (OSWorld). VLMs often know what to do but not what it looks like; without reliable visual grounding, agents misclick and stall. So, I built computer use\u2014without the \"use.\" It provides the visual grounding of an agent but keeps the human in the loop for the actual execution to prevent misclicks.<p>I personally use it for the AWS Console's \"treasure hunt\" UI, like creating a public S3 bucket with specific CORS rules. It\u2019s also been surprisingly helpful for non-technical tasks, like navigating obscure settings in Gradescope or Spotify. Ourguide really works for any task when you\u2019re stuck or don't know what to do.<p>You can download and test Ourguide here: <a href=\"https://ourguide.ai/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ourguide.ai/downloads</a><p>The project is still very early, and I\u2019d love your feedback on where it fails, where you think it worked well, and which specific niches you think Ourguide would be most helpful for.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769422\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46769422</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
