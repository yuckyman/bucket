      "title": "Representing Visual Objects, Attention, and Load in Human Occipito-temporal and Posterior Parietal Cortices",
      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "content": "IntroductionIdentifying brain topology alterations in chronic pain is a crucial step in understanding its pathophysiology. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess alterations in resting-state functional and structural global network properties in patients with chronic pain.MethodsFollowing the preregistration (PROSPERO CRD42024542390), databases were searched for studies comparing connectivity-based whole-brain global network properties between patients with chronic pain and healthy controls. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for each global network property separately.ResultsA total of 32 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies were included in the qualitative review, with 27 functional topology studies and 17 structural topology studies eligible for meta-analysis across nine unique structural and functional global network properties. The number of participants per meta-analysis ranged from 178 to 1,592. There was low-certainty evidence that chronic pain patients showed impairments in local efficiency of resting-state functional whole-brain topology (SMD: \u22120.50, 95%-CI: \u22120.81 to \u22120.19, 95%-PI: \u22121.38 to 0.38), and low to very low-certainty evidence that structural whole-brain topology was not altered in chronic pain across nine global network properties. The heterogeneity was high in the majority of functional (I2: 1\u201376%) and structural (I2: 68\u201397%) topology studies. Most functional (50%) and structural (65%) topology studies showed some concern regarding the risk of bias.DiscussionThe meta-analyses indicate that functional but not structural whole-brain topological reorganisation is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain.",

      "content": "AimThis study adopted Rasch Analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties of the neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA) in high-risk full-term infants during their NICU stay.MethodsA total of 543 full-term infants (14.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.02\u202fdays of age) were included in the study. We used the Rasch Model (RM) to assess the reliability and validity of the NBNA and GPCMlasso models to examine differential item functioning (DIF).ResultsThe samples responded to the NBNA according to the Rasch Model pattern. We found that the NBNA measures neurobehavior with one extra component regarding visual reactions. We found items that displayed disorder category functions in the NBNA. Conservatively, we found that the participants\u2019 responses to the NBNA items were mostly dependent on the neurological developmental level, regardless of demographic traits.ConclusionOur results support the applicability of the NBNA in depicting neurobehaviors in high-risk full-term infants in NICU. We found that high-risk infants could respond to NBNA items that were mostly dependent on the neural developmental level. The category functioning analysis revealed that the items provided inaccurate information owing to the disordered rating design.",

      "title": "Finite element analysis of a neural implant for cytostatic hypothermia and a novel heat management system",
      "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

      "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
      "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

      "title": "Foundation models for EEG decoding: current progress and prospective research",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",

      "title": "Nighttime sleep modulates mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila",
      "content": "Organisms must focus their attention on ethologically relevant stimuli to maximise survival and reproduction. This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.",

      "title": "Selective engagement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex during value-based but not perceptual decisions",
      "content": "A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether the brain uses specialized sub-systems for different types of decisions or relies on a unified decision-making network. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) provides an ideal test case for this question: it has a well-established role in value-based decisions but it remains unknown whether this reflects functional specialization or participation in a broader, general decision network. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used Neuropixels to monitor large ensembles of OFC neurons as a monkey performed both value-based and perceptual decision tasks. Consistent with prior reports, OFC was robustly engaged during value-based decisions. In contrast, OFC was minimally engaged during perceptual decisions, with no significant encoding of task parameters at either the single neuron or population level. This highlights the functional specialization of the OFC for value-based decisions and suggests that the different cognitive demands underlying different types of decisions recruit distinct neural circuits.",

      "title": "Signal mining of botulinum toxin type A adverse events based on FAERS database and its implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy",
      "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

      "content": "BackgroundThis study aims to develop a screening model for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) based on machine learning techniques.MethodsA retrospective cohort study collected clinical psychological factor data from the \u201cActive Health\u201d screening app under the National Key R&amp;D Program. The final dataset included 598 samples, with an SCD incidence rate of 26.12%. The data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 418). A validation set (n = 180) at a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD. The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and traditional LR models.",

      "title": "Detection of leptomeningeal angiomas in brain MRI of Sturge-Weber syndrome using multi-scale multi-scan Mamba",
      "content": "ObjectivesSturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder occurring in the early childhood. Timely diagnosis of SWS is essential for proper medical intervention that prevents the development of various neurological issues. Leptomeningeal angiomas (LA) are the clinical manifestation of SWS. Detection of LA is currently performed by manual inspection of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) by experienced neurologist, which is time-consuming and lack of inter-rater consistency. The aim of the present study is to investigate automated LA detection in MRI of SWS patients.MethodsA Mamba-based encoder-decoder architecture was employed in the present study. Particularly, a multi-scale multi-scan strategy was proposed to convert 3-D volume into 1-D sequence, enabling capturing long-range dependency with reduced computation complexity. Our dataset consists of 40 SWS patients with T1-enhanced MRI. The proposed model was first pre-trained on a public brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) dataset and then fine-tuned and tested on the SWS dataset using 5-fold cross validation.Results and conclusionOur results show excellent performance of the proposed method, e.g., Dice score of 91.53% and 78.67% for BraTS and SWS, respectively, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods as well as two neurologists. Mamba-based deep learning method can automatically identify LA in MRI images, enabling automated SWS diagnosis in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.
