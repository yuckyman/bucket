      "title": "Retrieval-related eye movements are predictive of memory precision",
      "content": "Eye movements are predictive of successful episodic memory encoding and retrieval, but it is unclear whether they reflect the precision of retrieved memory content. Here, we examined relationships between eye fixations, memory precision and fMRI BOLD activity. At study, participants were presented with object images, each placed at a random location on an invisible circle. At test, both studied and new images were presented. Participants were instructed to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image, recall and then signal its studied location, guessing if necessary. Simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking data were acquired during the test phase. For correctly recognized images, the trial-wise angular distance between the studied and reported locations was fitted to a two-component mixture model. Based on the model-derived parameters, correctly recognized images were categorized as those associated with successful location retrieval (location hits) or guesses. Location hits were further divided into high- and low precision trials. At retrieval, fixations predicted both successful retrieval and the precision of the retrieved location memory. Additionally, across-trial fixation patterns were more similar for location hits than for guesses, and for high- than for low-precision trials. The association between retrieval success and eye fixation precision was evident across almost the entire recall phase, whereas memory precision effects emerged around 1-1.5s after image onset. Fixation precision and fixation pattern similarity each predicted trial-wise memory precision independently of hippocampal BOLD activity, which also predicted precision. These findings suggest that eye fixations during retrieval track the fidelity of mnemonic content.",

      "title": "Gelatinase activity is required for Muller glia morphogenesis and neuronal maintenance in the retina",
      "content": "Glial cells are indispensable support elements of the nervous system, yet the mechanisms by which they integrate into densely packed, extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich environments remain poorly understood. In the retina, Muller glia (MG) serve as the principal support cells, performing roles analogous to astrocytes in the brain. As late-born retinal cells, MG undergo morphogenesis within a complex extracellular milieu composed of neighbouring neurons, synapses, and ECM components. Using the zebrafish retina, we show that developing MG dynamically interact with the ECM across all retinal layers while expressing the ECM-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp) 2 and 9. Although Mmps are known to contribute to tissue remodelling and disease processes such as glioma invasion, their developmental roles in glia remain less defined. Here, we demonstrate that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are required for MG morphogenesis and glia-neuron integration. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of mmp2 and mmp9 impaired MG outgrowth and reduced process complexity within synaptic layers, leading to decreased MG-synapse associations. Double mutants (mmp2-/-;mmp9-/-) displayed normal neuronal development and visual function at larval stages but exhibited gliosis, premature neurodegeneration, and visual deficits in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are critical for establishing MG-synapse interactions during development and for maintaining neuronal integrity and visual function in the mature retina.",

      "title": "Two-photon in vivo imaging reveals cell type-specific mitophagy dynamic changes in mouse somatosensory cortex during aging",
      "content": "Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained through mitochondrial autophagy, a process commonly known as mitophagy. Recent research has begun to highlight the region- and cell type-specific nature of mitophagy during brain aging; however, these dynamics have largely remained unexplored in living brains. To address this gap, we conducted two-photon mt-Keima imaging in somatosensory cortical neurons and astrocytes in behaving mice across two age groups. Our observations revealed a reduction in mitophagy levels in both cell types during aging, and we consistently found a higher level of mitophagy in astrocytes compared to neurons across both age groups, indicating a cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics that is independently of the aging process. NAD+ augmentation improved mitophagy level in both neurons and astrocytes in old-aged mice at the dose and method of administration tested. Collectively, our data underscore the critical importance of both neuronal and astrocytic metabolic roles in brain aging. The findings also suggest that NAD+ repletion has clinical value in potentially improving these cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics during aging.",

      "title": "PPAR\u03b4 activation in microglia drives a transcriptional response that primes phagocytic function while countering inflammatory activation",
      "content": "Microglia have been implicated in neurodegeneration, though their role remains unclear, as microglia can perform protective functions or promote neuroinflammation. Numerous studies have found that the transcriptome state of microglia can indicate where they lie along this continuum. To understand regulation of microglia transcriptome state, we considered the transcription factor PPAR{delta}, because it is highly expressed in microglia and is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease, (AD) a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss where microglia dysfunction is involved. When we delineated the microglia transcriptome in mice treated with PPAR{delta} agonist, we noted that PPAR{delta} activation blunted expression of inflammatory mediators and migration-enhancing genes, while boosting phagocytic genes. We then examined PPAR{delta} function in induced transcription factor (iTF) microglia-like cells, and confirmed PPAR{delta} agonism increases phagocyte function while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and migration. To understand PPAR{delta} regulation upon CNS insult, we exposed iTF-microglia to apoptotic neuron debris and defined six microglia transcriptome states as a function of PPAR{delta} activation, and observed PPAR{delta} agonism can shift microglia out of a homeostatic state to a primed, disease-associated microglia-like state. As PPAR{delta} agonism opposed gene expression favored by PU.1, a critical transcription factor in microglial inflammation and AD pathogenesis, we examined their relationship, documented a physical interaction, and found evidence for transrepression. Finally, we tested PPAR{delta} agonism in Huntington's disease and tauopathy mice, and demonstrated PPAR{delta} could decrease neuroinflammation in vivo. These findings suggest that PPAR{delta} agonist therapy may mitigate microglial dysfunction by restoring beneficial functions, while suppressing detrimental inflammation.",

      "title": "FLIM-FRET Imaging of AMPA Receptors: New Principle for Subtype-Specific Elucidation",
      "content": "-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and their subunit composition (GluA1-4) critically shapes synaptic strength and plasticity. Discriminating AMPAR subtypes at the molecular level remains challenging with conventional techniques. Here, we applied Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) combined with fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to resolve subtype-specific AMPAR assemblies. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and HALO domain were genetically introduced into GluA1-3 subunits to make intrareceptor FRET pairs. Self-labeling protein (SLP) domains such as SNAP and HALO were used with cell-impermeable substrates to selectively label surface-expressed receptors. This approach identified di-heterotetrameric GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 assemblies at the HEK293T cell membrane, whereas GluA1/3 failed to form di-heteromers. These findings demonstrate the FLIM-FRET method as a tool for differentiating AMPAR subtypes in living cells, providing a foundation for studying subtype-specific receptor organization in excitatory synapses.",

      "title": "Noise in Competing Representations Determines the Direction of Memory Biases",
      "content": "Our memories are reconstructions, prone to errors. Historically treated as a mere nuisance, memory errors have recently gained attention when found to be systematically shifted away from or towards non-reported items, promising insights into memory mechanisms. We argue that these biases are optimal and inevitable when the brain disentangles overlapping memory signals. Our simulations confirm that an ideal observer is biased, with bias direction depending not just on the absolute memory noise levels, but on the noise distribution between the memorized items. We test this prediction in four color memory experiments using a novel type of stimuli with independently varied noise levels. The results support our hypothesis, showing that targets with the same absolute noise level can be repelled from or attracted to non-target items, depending on their relative noise levels. These findings challenge the alternative models and support signal disentanglement as a unifying explanation of memory biases.",

      "title": "Large-Scale Brain Networks Track Gasoline Price Shifts",
      "content": "Macroeconomic conditions shape daily constraints and perceived environment, yet it remains unclear whether real-world economic dynamics are reflected in intrinsic brain organization at the population level. Here, I leveraged the Human Connectome Project (HCP) acquisition timeline as a naturalistic sampling frame to test whether macroeconomic time series vary with large-scale resting-state networks. Resting-state fMRI from 726 healthy young adults was aligned to quarterly macroeconomic indicators using the HCP \"Quarter\" variable. I quantified intrinsic organization using network functional connectivity (FC) and network-level amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). I implemented (1) a quasi-natural experiment contrasting a pre- vs post-gasoline-price shock (collapse) cohort, and (2) quarter-level partial correlations between network measures and four macro indicators, including gasoline price, consumer sentiment, unemployment, and stock market return. Post-shock participants showed significantly higher within-network FC across all seven networks and selective increases in between-network coupling concentrated among sensory and attention systems, as well as limbic-default interactions. ALFF exhibited bidirectional shifts: Visual ALFF increased post-shock, whereas Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF were higher pre-shock. Quarter-level analyses mirrored this differential pattern, with gas price positively associated with Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF and negatively with Visual and Dorsal Attention ALFF. Across macro indicators, gasoline price and consumer sentiment showed the most widespread FC associations, with largely opposing correlation signatures, while unemployment and equity returns were comparatively weak after correction. These findings suggest that salient, behaviorally proximal macroeconomic dynamics, particularly energy price variation, track population-level differences in intrinsic brain network architecture, motivating future work with finer-grained timing and individual-level exposure measures to strengthen causal inference.",

      "title": "N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Deletion in Dopamine D2 Receptor Cells and Associated Neuronal and Behavioural Changes in Mice",
      "content": "N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and membrane molecule trafficking by regulating membrane fusion. Dysfunction of NSF has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the interaction of NSF with dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) and the resulting excitotoxicity from its reduction in vitro have been demonstrated, the role of NSF in D2R-expressing cells in vivo remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of NSF loss on the survival of D2R-expressing cells and on mouse behaviour. We generated D2R-specific NSF conditional knockout (Nsff/f;D2R-Cre) mice. Targeted deletion of NSF in D2R-expressing cells led to a significant decrease in D2R-expressing neurons, accompanied by increased apoptosis during postnatal development, reduced striatal volume, and substantially lowered dopamine levels in the striatum. Further evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction was shown by reduced dopamine transporter expression in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. The Nsff/f;D2R-Cre mice exhibited attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours, including hyperactivity and impulsivity. Notably, combined administration of methylphenidate and a D2R agonist effectively alleviated hyperactivity and impulsivity, indicating a potential synergistic approach for ADHD treatment. These findings highlight the critical role of NSF in the survival of D2R-expressing neurons and suggest that disruption of the NSF-D2R interaction may contribute to ADHD-like phenotypes. This study underscores the translational relevance of the Nsff/f;D2R-Cre model for ADHD and suggests that targeting D2R dysfunction, particularly in treatment-resistant cases, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ADHD.",

      "title": "Cross-modal quality transfer: enhancing MEG spatial resolution using BOLD-fMRI and Explainable machine learning.",
      "content": "Purpose: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer complementary insights into brain function, with BOLD-fMRI providing high spatial resolution and MEG offering high temporal sensitivity. This study aimed to enhance MEG spatial resolution through learning inter-modal relationships via data-driven fusion with BOLD-fMRI using explainable machine learning (xML). Methods: MEG and BOLD-fMRI data were collected for sixteen participants watching the same naturalistic visual stimulus. MEG signals were filtered into standard frequency bands and processed to match the haemodynamic response. Data were then decomposed using Tensorial Independent Component Analysis (TICA), yielding 250 MEG (25 per frequency band) and 30 BOLD-fMRI components. A set of Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) models were trained to predict MEG component activity from downsampled BOLD-fMRI components. The models with best-performing configuration of hyperparameters at this resolution were then used to generate voxelwise upsampled MEG maps using the natively higher-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. Performance was compared to trilinear interpolation using R2, mean squared error (MSE), and structural similarity index (SSI). Model interpretability was enhanced by generating Shapley values (SHAP), describing relationships between input data and model output. Results Models trained on 6mm3 data achieved high predictive performance on previously unseen data (R2 = 0.80, MSE = .07). Using higher-resolution 2mm3 BOLD-fMRI data, MEG activity was upsampled to 2mm3, resulting in more detailed image, while maintaining reasonable congruence to naive interpolation (R2 = .81, MSE = .06). Conclusions: This work demonstrates that explainable machine learning enables spatial super-resolution of MEG maps via BOLD-fMRI-informed quality transfer, enabling enhancement of spatial resolution, and offering improved localization, as well as means of generating data-driven insights into neurovascular coupling.",

      "content": "The hemodynamic response function (HRF) links neuronal activity to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. While most fMRI studies use a canonical HRF, increasing evidence from studies of healthy subjects suggests that the HRF depends on anatomical location and disease states. Here, we investigate how HRF variability relates to anatomical location and pathology in the epileptic brain, using a large simultaneous electroencephalogram and fMRI dataset. Applying HRF deconvolution and temporal decomposition, we built the first whole-brain HRF library specific to epilepsy, identifying four distinct shape groups. We mapped HRF features across parcellations of two atlases using novel Bayesian hierarchical models. In non-epileptogenic regions, HRF shape and spatial distributions align with findings from healthy subjects. Within pathological regions, they vary significantly according to pathology. Our results indicate that HRF variability is associated with pathology, in addition to its dependence on anatomical location, motivating region- and pathology-based HRF modulation in epilepsy studies.",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
