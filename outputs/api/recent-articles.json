      "title": "MORPH2DIAG: Automated Structural MRI Preprocessing and Tissue Segmentation for Interpretable Machine and Deep Learning-Based Neuroanatomical Classification",
      "content": "Structural MRI provides a noninvasive window into brain morphology, yet the reproducibility and interpretability of morphometric analyses remain limited by inconsistent preprocessing, variable spatial alignment, and heterogeneous feature construction. We introduce MORPH2DIAG, a fully automated, atlas-free morphometric pipeline that integrates standardized preprocessing, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, data-driven subtyping, and machine- and deep-learning classification within a single, modular framework. The pipeline performs intensity normalization, morphological cleanup, PCA-informed affine alignment, isotropic rescaling, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) segmentation to generate quantitative gray-matter (GM), white-matter (WM), and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) maps. Global tissue fractions were used to derive latent neuroanatomical subtypes via unsupervised K-means clustering, revealing progressive GM--CSF gradients consistent with patterns commonly observed along normative-to-atrophic structural continua observed in neurodegeneration. To capture finer-grained spatial heterogeneity, a voxel-wise K-means parcellation yielded parcel-level intensity means and variances that served as regional morphometric descriptors. These global and parcel-level features were integrated into a unified evaluation suite comparing classical machine learning models (Random Forests, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with lean, deep, and hybrid multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) trained using focal loss, label smoothing, stochastic weight averaging, and nested cross-validation with PCA-based dimensionality reduction. Across methods, the hybrid MLP achieved the highest macro-F1 and balanced accuracy, demonstrating strong discriminative performance for the discovered morphometric subtypes. Collectively, MORPH2DIAG establishes a fully automated, atlas-free framework that unites unsupervised structural subtype discovery with interpretable machine and deep learning, providing a reproducible foundation for MRI-based morphometric profiling and automated detection of neurodegenerative-like patterns.",

      "title": "The cost of dual-task walking: cognitive demands restrict visual search and gait planning",
      "content": "Adaptive walking relies on proactive visual search to plan foot placement and maintain stability. This study examined how cognitive load and task complexity affect gaze behaviour and gait biomechanics during a precision target-stepping task in healthy young adults. We also quantified the frequency of cross-stepping during the experimental task. Twenty-three participants (18-23 years) walked along an L-shaped pathway containing raised stepping targets under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Targets had four different layouts to create high and low difficulty conditions. Eye movements were recorded using mobile eye-tracking, and gait kinematics were captured via motion capture. Compared with ST, DT walking produced slower walking speeds, longer stance times, and reduced velocity between stepping targets, indicating a more inefficient gait strategy. Eye-tracking analyses revealed fewer and shorter fixations on task-relevant targets and a greater number of fixations directed toward task-irrelevant areas under DT conditions. In DT, saccadic amplitudes were reduced despite increased outside fixations, suggesting a breakdown in visual exploration between proximal and distal regions of the walkway. Cross-stepping was more frequent in ST conditions than in DT. These findings indicate that increased cognitive load compromises proactive visual search, likely through working-memory and attentional limitations that disrupt feedforward gait planning. Contrary to expectation, cross-stepping occurred more often during ST than DT walking, suggesting that in this population cross-stepping may not be a maladaptive strategy. Overall, these results highlight the cognitive demands of adaptive walking even in young, low-risk individuals and underscore the importance of preserving visual-motor coordination under cognitive stress.",

      "title": "A Load-Induced Energetic Tipping Point Explains Selective Vulnerability of Substantia Nigra Neurons",
      "content": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease, while closely related neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are comparatively spared. Although mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and -synuclein aggregation have each been implicated, none alone explains why anatomically similar populations exhibit such different fates. Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures only mitochondrial functional capacity, energetic reserve, and the combined load from axonal arborization and calcium handling. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals that increasing structural load deforms the energetic landscape until a saddle-node bifurcation emerges, producing coexisting healthy-energy and collapsed-energy states. SNc-like neurons, which bear extreme axonal and calcium-handling demands, reside inside this bistable regime, operating near a separatrix that renders them vulnerable to even modest metabolic perturbations. In contrast, VTA-like neurons lie outside the bistable window and robustly return to their high-energy state following similar disturbances. The model reproduces hallmark features of Parkinsonian degeneration - long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility - using only the geometry of load-dependent energy regulation. These findings suggest that selective SNc vulnerability arises not from unique molecular defects, but from the fundamental dynamical structure imposed by their extraordinary anatomical and physiological load.",

      "title": "Selective distractor representations resolve multidimensional interference",
      "content": "How can humans manage multiple sources of information competing for attention? To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of this reactive suppression, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Behavioral and neural effects converged to show that dimension-specific interference and adaptation are associated with the speed of visual integration of each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process.",

      "title": "Order code in the olfactory system.",
      "content": "The ability to recognize odor identity across a wide range of concentrations is essential for natural olfactory behaviors However how odor identity is represented in the early olfactory system remains an open question One theory proposes that glomeruli in the olfactory bulb along with their associated odorant receptors ORs are activated by odorants in a temporal order that conveys information about odor identity This order code is relatively robust to concentration changes as the rank order of glomerular activation by a given odorant remains similar across concentrations Alternatively the primacy coding theory suggests that odor identity is defined by the most sensitive ORs those that respond first collectively referred to as the primacy set To test these theories we measured glomerular responses to a large set of odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb using calcium imaging We found that receptor affinities can be embedded in a lowdimensional space D 10 with minimal loss of information Within this space we identified two clusters of glomeruli with distinct tuning properties that form independent odor representations These clusters may correspond to the two phylogenetic classes of ORs as revealed by both their functional characteristics and anatomical locations In the OR affinity space odorants evoke orderly activation waves whose directions can be used to define odor identities in the order coding model Finally we compared the order code and primacy model in predicting odor identity both across concentrations and across animals Despite containing less information overall the primacy model performed comparably to the order code We confirmed the primacy models prediction that each receptor tends to contribute to the primacy set of at least one odorant Analysis of binary odor mixtures revealed that mixture responses lie along geodesic lines connecting their component odors Together these findings suggest that odor information in the olfactory bulb may be represented through two complementary coding strategies the primacy and order codes.",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
