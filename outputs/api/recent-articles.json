      "title": "Hippocampal tangential insertions of high-density silicone probes in head-fixed mice enhance spatial sampling",
      "content": "The hippocampus is a key structure within the medial temporal lobe which plays a central role in the formation and consolidation of declarative memories. Despite technological progress, a full understanding of hippocampal rhythms, neuronal population activity, and the underlying connectivity remain elusive, partly due to its complex morphology in a croissant-like shape which limits coronal and sagittal approaches. To address this limitation, we propose two different tangential insertions of high-density electrode probes aligned to either the dorsal or ventral sections of the hippocampus. Each approach enables the placement of up to 384 recording sites within the hippocampal formation. Both insertions are performed in head-fixed condition, which further allows for detailed monitoring of the animals behavioral states, including spontaneous running and facial movements. The two proposed tangential dorsal and ventral insertions capture almost continuously the physiology of the hippocampus across 3.84 mm of tissue. When placed across the pyramidal layer, such insertions can harness ripple oscillations over 120 channels, corresponding to approximately ~1.2 mm of tissue, with a coverage of 2 channels every 20 micrometer. Furthermore, such insertions enabled us to record up to 400 hippocampal neurons simultaneously from a single probe, endowing us with the capability to capture within a single recording several hundreds of functionally connected neuronal pairs. Lastly, these insertions were performed in head-fixed mice on a running band, which can be combined with high frequency sampling camera, allowing us to precisely monitor facial movements, and their hippocampal correlates. An orthogonal/vertical approach is a more standard way to record electrophysiological activity from most brain regions, including the hippocampus. Vertical insertions thereby miss the antero-posterior axis of the brain in the hippocampus and therefore putative propagating events. Furthermore, vertical insertions have a lower reach in terms of number of channels, single units, and spatial density being recorded, even with multi-shank high-density probes. Tangential insertions therefore substantially increase spatial reach and resolution, which leads to a higher number of cells recorded in a single insertion along the antero-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, compared to freely moving approaches, head-fixed conditions enable precise monitoring of facial movements. Dorsal and ventral head-fixed tangential insertions of Neuropixels probes in the hippocampus increase the resolution and spatial extent of recordings, allowing more precise and extensive monitoring of network activity and its underlying connectivity.",

      "title": "Virtual prototyping of non-invasive spinal cord electrical stimulation targeting upper limb motor function",
      "content": "Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied over the cervical or lumbar spinal cord facilitates motor function after paralysis. However, emerging electrophysiological evidence indicates mechanistic differences between cervical and lumbar tSCS and across different cervical tSCS paradigms. To clarify these discrepancies, we developed and validated a multi-scale, whole-body computational model of tSCS-induced volume conduction, axonal recruitment, and synaptic transmission. Across 24 cervical and four lumbar tSCS paradigms, simulations showed that somatosensory afferents consistently exhibit lower stimulation thresholds than motor efferents. In turn, region-specific synaptic transmission differences may explain electrophysiological discrepancies between cervical and lumbar tSCS. Across cervical tSCS paradigms, substantial volume conduction and axonal recruitment differences were observed that explain electrophysiological discrepancies. Specifically, clinically-prevalent paradigms, including those with anodes placed over the clavicles or iliac crests, engaged peripheral nerves in addition to spinal roots. This effect was amplified by multiphasic waveforms, which introduced recruitment sites near the anodes. By integrating simulations with electrophysiological recordings in 14 able-bodied individuals, we investigated previously unexplored cervical tSCS paradigms on their capacity to recruit somatosensory afferents relative to motor threshold.",

      "title": "When the brightest is not the best: illuminant estimation from the geometry of specular highlights",
      "content": "Color constancy allows us to perceive stable object colors under different lighting conditions by reducing the impact of lighting. Information about illuminant color could be derived from a white surface or a specular highlight. The 'brightest is white' heuristic has been frequently incorporated in illumination estimation models, to identify illuminant color. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis: we use structured changes in the proximal image to identify highlight regions, even when they are not the brightest elements in the scene. In computer-rendered scenes, we varied the reliability of 'brightest element' and 'highlight geometry' cues, testing their effect on a color constancy task. Each scene had a single spherical surface lit by several point lights with identical spectral properties. The surface had a uniform spectral reflectance but a noise texture that attenuated the reflectance by a variable scale factor. We tested three levels of specularity: zero (matte), low, and mid. Observers watched a 1.5-second animation and responded if color changes were due to illuminant or material changes. Discrimination performance for matte surfaces was nearly at chance level, as predicted. However, as specularity increased, performance improved significantly. Observers outperformed an ideal observer model who relied solely on the brightest element. Notably, when the specular region appeared on a dark part of the texture, observer performance improved even more even though the brightest element heuristic would predict a decrease. When specular geometries were difficult to identify due to phase scrambling, observer performance significantly dropped. These results suggest that we do not simply rely on the brightest element, but rather utilize regularities of diffuse and specular components of the proximal image to solve surface and illuminant ambiguities.",

      "title": "Uncovering Dynamic Neural Information Flow with Continuous-Time Weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks",
      "content": "Understanding how information dynamically flows within neural systems is a crucial problem in neuroscience. Traditional approaches often assume stationary or quasi-stationary functional networks, which fail to capture the time-varying dynamics of interactions among neural variables. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous-Time weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks (CTwDBN), a non-stationary graphical modeling framework for uncovering smoothly time-varying conditional dependencies. Validation on synthetic datasets demonstrated that CTwDBN reliably recovers the structure and dynamics of ground-truth information flow. Application to electrophysiological recordings during a guided saccade task revealed temporal fluctuations in conditional dependencies in the cortical network that persisted an order of magnitude longer than the receptive field dynamics. In the resting-state cortex, CTwDBN revealed persistent fluctuations within a low-dimensional dependency space reflecting canonical anatomical motifs. These results highlight CTwDBN as a versatile analytical framework for capturing dynamic information flow in neural systems with broad applicability to complex biological and artificial systems.",

      "content": "This study presents a stereotactic microbiopsy technique for sampling defined brain regions in living mice, enabling transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses without sacrificing the animal. The method will allow pre-intervention tissue collection, making it possible to separate preexisting molecular differences from experience- or treatment-induced changes. We show that microbiopsies yield sufficient, high-quality RNA and chromatin for sequencing, with minimal tissue damage that largely resolves over time. The procedure uses standard stereotactic equipment and achieves reproducible spatial precision when the syringe is stabilised. This approach provides a practical framework for within-subject molecular comparisons, reducing animal use and enabling longitudinal profiling of the living mouse brain. It establishes a foundation for investigating how baseline molecular states influence later physiological or behavioural outcomes.",

      "title": "The \tC. elegans nervous system reads the internal state of the hydrogen peroxide-detoxification machinery to trigger escape from this common reactive chemical",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the most common reactive chemical threat faced by organisms. Here, we map the neural circuit that drives chemotactic escape from environmental H2O2 in the nematode C. elegans. Twenty-four neuron classes with sensory endings at the mouth and nose of the animal detect H2O2. Their response dynamics encode stimulus intensity and exposure history, and their partial redundancy makes avoidance resilient to the loss of individual inputs. Sensing begins when H2O2 oxidizes the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of the cytosolic peroxiredoxin PRDX-2, which relays this oxidative signal to cysteines on the LITE-1 and GUR-3 ion channels, triggering calcium influx in sensory neurons that drive escape. Most of these neurons release glutamate to drive H2O2-dependent excitation of AIA interneurons, whereas others signal through non-glutamatergic routes, providing multiple routes for signal transmission. Thus, the C. elegans nervous system acts as a hydrogen peroxide sentinel that monitors H2O2-induced changes in the intracellular H2O2-detoxification machinery and relays them to interneurons driving organism-wide escape. This raises the possibility that circuit defects in aging and neurodegenerative disease arise from altered peroxiredoxin-mediated H2O2 signaling rather than primarily from direct macromolecular damage.",

      "title": "Understanding corticosterone fluctuations and HPA-axis regulation in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet expansion in the ATXN3 gene, primarily characterized by motor impairments. However, SCA3/MJD also includes mood-related comorbidities that affect both patients and their caregivers. Current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive care, as no disease-modifying therapies are available. Previously, we have demonstrated decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in post-mortem SCA3 human and mouse brains and elevated peripheral corticosterone (CORT) levels in SCA3 mice at late disease stages. Impaired GR signaling is typically associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, common in stress-related psychiatric diseases. Our study aimed to dissect the HPA-axis (dys)function and the effect of stress exposure on SCA3/MJD progression. Using the CMVMJD135 mouse model, we evaluated HPA-axis regulation in SCA3/MJD by measuring CORT levels throughout disease progression (6 to 34 weeks of age) under basal conditions and after acute stress. At week 35, these mice underwent a dexamethasone injection to challenge the HPA-axis, and the CORT levels were measured at different timepoints to evaluate the axis response. Additionally, we applied a 6-week chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol in another cohort of mice starting at an early symptomatic stage to assess stress effects on the progression of motor impairments. Our findings indicate that serum CORT levels in SCA3 mice begin to rise between 26 to 30 weeks of age, with no impairment in the physiological response to acute stress. SCA3 mice were also able to normalize CORT levels after dexamethasone challenge, suggesting normal HPA-axis function. While CUS exposure had a transient negative impact on the motor phenotype, this effect did not persist throughout disease progression. In conclusion, stressful events, either acute or chronic, do not seem to be major determinants of disease severity in SCA3 mice.",

      "title": "Non-viral vasculogenic reprogramming restores cognition and mitigates pathology in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, synaptic loss, and profuse neuronal death. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that cerebrovascular impairment precedes the emergence of neuropathological hallmarks, implicating vascular dysfunction as an early contributor to AD onset and progression. We investigated a non-viral strategy to generate pro-vasculogenic fibroblasts by transiently overexpressing Etv2, Foxc2, and Fli1 (EFF) as a potential cell-based therapy for neurovascular deficits in AD. To assess therapeutic potential, EFF-primed fibroblasts were injected into a mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) and wild-type controls via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route, followed by cognitive assessments and subsequent brain tissue analyses. Our findings demonstrate that EFF-primed fibroblasts acquire vasculogenic properties, enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF), and alleviate spatial memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, transplanted EFF-primed fibroblasts exhibited long-term survival, integrated into the brain vasculature, and promoted cortical vascular remodeling in the AD brain. Notably, ICV deployment of these cells is also correlated with reduced cortical A{beta} load, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits in reducing AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified the activation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as Ppar, known for its anti-amyloidogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Collectively, these findings highlight non-viral, reprogramming-based vasculogenic cell therapy as a promising strategy for AD, capable of alleviating cognitive decline and addressing AD pathology across cellular and tissue scales",

      "title": "Gamma oscillations across recording scales show a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in the primate visual cortex",
      "content": "Stimulus-induced narrowband gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) arise due to excitatory-inhibitory interactions and have been proposed to carry feedforward prediction errors during visual processing. However, the dependence of gamma on stimulus color is not well characterized, with some studies showing a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in invasive recordings from the primary visual cortex (V1), while others showing no preference for red in luminance and cone-contrast balanced colors spanning the Derrington-Krauskopf-Lennie (DKL) isoluminant plane in non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. To address these discrepancies, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from V1 (n=2 monkeys) along with scalp electroencephalography (EEG), while presenting luminance-matched hues spanning the entire permissible range of colors. We found that saturated reddish hues produced the strongest gamma in both LFP and EEG in both monkeys. However, gamma was reduced when the colors were desaturated, so that selectivity for reddish hues was diminished or absent on the DKL space, as shown previously. Interestingly, selectivity was further reduced in EEG compared to LFP. Simultaneous recordings from an intermediate visual area (V4, n=1) revealed weak color-induced gamma, partially explaining the weakening of hue selectivity in macro-signals. Gamma power increased with increasing activation along the red-green (L-M) cardinal axis but was virtually absent along the blue-yellow (S-(L+M)) axis, suggesting that gamma could be a reflection of the L-M cone-contrast mechanism. These results comprehensively resolve the earlier discrepancy and shed light about the neural mechanisms underlying gamma generation in primate V1.",

      "title": "The ApoC2 mimetic peptide D6PV enhances remyelination by stimulating oxidative phosphorylation in oligodendrocytes",
      "content": "Failure of remyelination drives neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), with disrupted lipid handling and metabolic stress in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) posing major barriers to repair. Here, we identify the dual ApoC-II mimetic- ApoC-III antagonist peptide D6PV as a metabolic modulator that directly enhances OPC differentiation and myelin repair. Across ex vivo and in vivo models of chemically induced demyelination, D6PV promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and restores myelin integrity independently of lipoprotein hydrolysis or modulation of lipid droplet-containing phagocytes. Guided by transcriptomics analyses, we find that D6PV stimulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, while suppressing inflammatory transcriptional programs, thereby driving OPCs toward a myelinating phenotype. Notably, D6PV does not alter peripheral immune composition or autoimmune-driven pathology in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, indicating a central nervous system (CNS) cell-autonomous effect. These findings reveal a metabolism-linked pathway for remyelination and position D6PV as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance CNS repair in demyelinating diseases.",
