      "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
      "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

      "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

      "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

      "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
      "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

      "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
      "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

      "content": "Vascular normalization [stabilization of aberrant angiogenesis and restoration of blood-brain barrier (BBB)] is critical for reducing long-term secondary sequelae after ischemic stroke. How immune and developmental signaling pathways coordinate these processes is poorly understood. Here we identify a unique brain endothelial cell (BEC) type one interferon (IFN1) signature in human and mouse ischemic stroke tissue. By leveraging two clinically-relevant murine ischemic stroke models, single-cell transcriptomics, and BBB functional assays, we find that deletion of endothelial IFN1 receptor (Ifnar1) exacerbates post-stroke BBB disruption and expands a BEC population expressing angiogenic and immature BBB markers. Conversely, IFN-beta administration immediately after stroke reduces acute BBB disruption. Activation of IFN1 signaling in mouse BECs in vitro promotes junctional stabilization and reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling to enhance barrier properties, but suppress angiogenic features. Thus, endogenous endothelial IFN1 signaling modulates BBB dysfunction and angiogenesis to promote vascular normalization after ischemic brain injury.",

      "title": "A Shared Neural Marker Predicts Creative Performance Across Distinct Problem-Solving Tasks",
      "content": "Creativity is essential for innovation, yet the brain mechanisms supporting its moment-to-moment variability remain unclear. We hypothesize that creativity depends on dynamic fluctuations in neural flexibility, which determine the potential to generate creative solutions. Here, we identify a shared neural marker of 'creativity potential' that predicts upcoming performance across distinct problem-solving tasks. Twenty-eight participants completed the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), a measure of divergent thinking, and the Fusion Innovation Test (FIT), which integrates divergent and convergent thinking. Responses were scored for novelty, feasibility, and goal attainment using validated GPT-based automated evaluation. EEG signals recorded prior to problem onset were used to decode single-trial creativity scores. A decoding model based on coherence features achieved robust performance (r = 0.45, leave-one-trial-out) and generalized across individuals (r = 0.34, leave-one-subject-out). Feature weights revealed a creativity potential network (CPN), characterized by frontal-temporal interactions in beta frequency band. Applying the model to resting-state recordings revealed ~3-minute cycles of creativity potential, suggesting intrinsic brain dynamics shape readiness for creative problem-solving. These findings establish a shared neural marker of creativity that transcends task boundaries and individuals. Beyond advancing our understanding of creative cognition, this work opens the possibility of monitoring creativity potential in real time, with implications for neurofeedback and creativity enhancement in daily life.",

      "title": "Characterizing Simultaneously Recorded Auditory Brainstem and Middle Latency Responses Using the Parallel Auditory Brainstem Response Paradigm",
      "content": "Purpose The auditory brainstem response (ABR) and middle latency response (MLR) are used to characterize hearing but typically require separate recordings due to differing optimal parameters and setups in clinical systems. Advances such as the parallel ABR (pABR) paradigm now allow simultaneous recording of both responses, enabling more comprehensive assessments. We evaluated this simultaneous recording approach by characterizing responses at near- and suprathreshold levels using parameters optimized for pABR. Methods This study used an open dataset [1] of pABR recordings from 20 normal hearing adults to tone-pip stimuli at five frequencies, six presentation rates, and two intensities. ABR (I, III, and V) and MLR (P0, Na, Pa, Nb, Pb) waves were analyzed for presence, latency, and amplitude using linear mixed effect modeling. Results At both levels, ABR wave V and MLR waves Na and Pa were the most consistently identifiable and largest peaks across frequencies, rates, and participants. Frequency and rate changes affected ABR wave V amplitude more than the MLR peaks, whose amplitudes and latencies remained comparatively stable across the moderate and soft levels used in this study. Conclusion ABR wave V and MLR waves Na and Pa are robust and consistently identifiable with pABR-optimized parameters. A simultaneous recording approach that leverages visualization of all three components could both assess auditory function across more areas of the auditory system using a moderate suprathreshold level, and support detection/interpretation of smaller wave Vs for threshold estimation, particularly for broader low frequency responses.",

      "title": "CNS-Tau Specific Antibodies Illuminate Disease Signatures Across Tauopathies",
      "content": "Background: Alternative splicing of the MAPT gene produces distinct tau isoforms in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS), yet their respective biological and pathological roles remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that CNS-tau may play a key role in amyloid-{beta} associated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the absence of isoform-specific tools has limited both mechanistic insight and biomarker development. We aimed to develop and validate CNS-tau-specific monoclonal antibodies and assess their utility in neuropathology and fluid-based biomarker assays across AD and primary tauopathies. Methods: We generated six recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibodies targeting a CNS-tau-specific sequence encoded by exons 4 and 5. Specificity and affinity were evaluated via biolayer interferometry, immunoblotting, and tau-expressing HEK293 models. The lead clone, LL-T-1-1, was tested in postmortem brain sections from AD (n = 23), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 3), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD, n = 3). A second clone, LL-T-1-5, was optimized for use in plasma assays via an ultrasensitive nanoneedle platform, LoD < 1 pg/ml. Results: LL-T-1-1 showed nanomolar affinity for CNS-tau and no cross-reactivity with PNS-tau. It selectively labeled dystrophic neurites in AD and all hallmark tau lesions in PSP and CBD without antigen retrieval. LL-T-1-5-based plasma assays revealed CNS-tau levels significantly correlated with cognitive scores (MMSE and QDRS) and differentiated impaired from unimpaired individuals. Conclusions: CNS-tau-specific antibodies LL-T-1-1 and LL-T-1-5 provide new tools for neuropathology and fluid biomarker development across tauopathies.",

      "title": "Decoding real world visual scenes from the human gamma band with flicker evoked oscillations.",
      "content": "Current approaches to investigate the role of neural oscillations in natural scene processing have been limited to artificial stimuli and long data collection. We present a new way to decode real-world scenes participants are viewing from the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) evoked while wearing flickering LCD glasses. We discovered that SSVEP responses from real world scenes are surprisingly complex and have distinct waveform shapes: they differ markedly across scenes and participants but are consistent within individuals, even across multiple days. SSVEP shape varies greatly between stimuli, but is reliable, meaning that decoding works even with a single electrode. Decoding is highly accurate with 5-10 seconds of data and was still above chance level with less than a second of data. Decomposing the SSVEPs into frequency bands showed that the information about the visual scene is present across all of the harmonics of the flicker frequency, but with 40 Hz (gamma band) showing the highest amount of information across the different flicker frequencies tested. These findings implicate a broad range of oscillations in encoding real-world scenes, with a particular importance for 40 Hz. The SSVEPs temporal profile is a rich source of information for decoding.",

      "title": "Focal infrared stimulation modulates somatosensory cortical activity in mice: evidence for TRPV1 ion channel involvement",
      "content": "Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a promising approach for minimally invasive modulation of neuronal activity, yet its cellular and molecular mechanisms in the intact brain remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated focal INS in the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized mice using high-density Neuropixels recordings combined with histological analysis. Continuous-wave and pulsed (500 Hz) infrared illumination elicited robust modulation of cortical activity, with approximately half of recorded neurons exhibiting either increased or suppressed firing. The modulatory effects of stimulation were comparable across cortical layers and neuron types. While both stimulation modes were effective, continuous-wave stimulation typically produced stronger changes in firing rates and network dynamics than pulsed illumination. To explore molecular contributions, we compared responses in wild-type and TRPV1 knockout mice. Neuronal responses to INS were significantly reduced in knockout animals, indicating a key role for TRPV1 channels. We also observed layer- and neuron-type-specific differences in firing rate modulation between wild-type and knockout animals. Histological analysis confirmed that TRPV1-expressing neurons are distributed throughout cortical layers, supporting their involvement in the observed responses. These findings provide direct evidence that TRPV1 contributes to INS-evoked cortical activity and advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying infrared neuromodulation. This work lays a foundation for the future use of infrared light as a precise and minimally invasive tool for cortical circuit manipulation.",
