      "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Progressive synaptic and neuronal loss underlies the decline in cognition and daily functioning, often accompanied by behavioral and psychological symptoms. Among these, neuropsychiatric disturbances such as agitation and aggression affect 20%-65% of patients and represent a major source of caregiver burden. The serotonin receptor antagonist MW073 has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate, showing efficacy in counteracting Abeta- and tau-induced synaptic and memory deficits in AD mouse models. Here, we investigated whether MW073 also mitigates aggressive behavior in Tg2576 mice, a widely used AD model that also displays heightened aggressiveness. Our findings demonstrate that MW073 significantly reduced aggressive tendencies in Tg2576 mice, suggesting that serotonergic modulation may represent a promising strategy to address both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD.",

      "content": "Red light is considered less phototoxic than blue light and is widely used in both research and photobiomodulation therapy. The difference in the response to brain exposure to light between young and old mammals is currently unknown. We found that brain exposure to blue light caused local damage in the cerebral cortex in both young and old mice. Brain exposure to red light did not have any noticeable effect on young mice. However, it caused a marked reduction in electroencephalogram power, damaged fiber bundles throughout the brain, and brought about a coma-like state in old mice. The effect of red light on electroencephalogram power was dose-dependent and particularly strong in the theta range. When delivered at a lower intensity but over a longer period, red light produced a similar reduction in electroencephalogram power and brain damage as those seen in the mice treated with higher irradiation over a shorter period. These results indicate that the impact of light on electroencephalogram and brain tissue strongly depends not only on the light wavelength, duration and intensity of the exposure, but also on the age of the animal and type of tissue exposed to light.",

      "title": "Neonatal Microglia and Their Secretome as Mediators of Brain Repair",
      "content": "Microglia are essential regulators of myelin integrity and repair, yet their regenerative capacity declines with ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Neonatal microglia retain a uniquely reparative program that may offer insight into restoring lost functions in the adult CNS. Here we show that transplantation of neonatal microglia ameliorates disability, reduces leukocyte infiltration, and promotes remyelination in both inflammatory (EAE) and non-inflammatory (cuprizone) models, and reverses cognitive decline in aged mice. These benefits persisted even when transplanted cells remained confined to the meninges and were reproduced by the neonatal microglia secretome, indicating a paracrine mechanism. Multi-omic profiling revealed that the neonatal secretome is enriched in trophic factors and membrane-building lipids compared to adult microglia, while transcriptomic analyses of treated aged brains showed reactivation of developmental repair pathways and suppression of inflammatory signatures. Together, these results demonstrate that neonatal microglia re-engage rejuvenation-like programs in the adult CNS and highlight the importance of multifactorial strategies, integrating trophic, metabolic, and immunomodulatory cues, over single-target approaches. Our findings establish early microglial programs as a paradigm for designing new regenerative therapies for CNS disorders.",

      "content": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in flexible, context-dependent decision-making. Yet, the population-level mechanisms that support this flexibility remain unclear: is there a generalist neural population involved in representing useful information across tasks, or are representations distributed over multiple modules of task-specialized subpopulations? Here, we investigate whether the population structure modularity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increases with sensorimotor remapping between task rules in two different paradigms. In a paradigm where all stimuli were remapped, we found a highly modular structure with two task-specialized subpopulations and one generalist. In a different paradigm where only half of the stimuli were remapped, modularity decreased but remained significant. Based on predictions drawn from a recurrent neural network fitted to experimental data, we propose that a gain modulation by global inhibition of mPFC can explain how task-specialized neurons emerge to varying degrees in each paradigm.",

      "content": "Even when stimuli and tasks are held constant, brain activity fluctuates markedly across trials, yet it is not well understood how these fluctuations affect decision-making and behavior. Here we address this gap in knowledge using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a perceptual decision-making task. Applying an established analytical framework, we show that CNN activity exhibits trial-level variability reflecting findings from human neuroimaging. Examination of the internal state revealed three distinct activation patterns reflecting: (i) decisions dominated by strong sensory evidence, (ii) decisions under low discriminability with weak or ambiguous evidence, and (iii) decisions in which sensory evidence was opposed by bias. Notably, choice bias shifted the decision boundary, improving performance despite low or conflicting evidence. Together, these findings show that variability in CNN activity can serve as a model for understanding how the brain transforms changes in internal states into adaptive behavior, providing a bridge between fluctuations in activity, decision-making, and behavior.",

      "content": "When we view cluttered environments containing multiple objects, the neural code for individual items can become ambiguous. This reflects a capacity limit in spatially-tuned visual neurons: when multiple objects fall within the cell receptive field, output cannot be attributed to a single object. Vision models from primate electrophysiology propose this is resolved by attention, which biases competition between object representations. However, evidence in humans is sparse and inconclusive, and reliance on single-cell data limits insight into underlying mechanisms and neurophysiological scope. Here, we use a novel multivariate approach to the analysis of human EEG and concurrent EEG/MRI to address this. First, we test whether attention is recruited by representational ambiguity. Second, we identify the mechanisms that act on representations of attended and unattended objects to resolve ambiguity. Finally, we characterize the millisecond timing and whole-brain action of these mechanisms to identify pervasive effects in semantic and executive brain networks.",

      "title": "Altered Molecular Composition of a Specific Subset of Prefrontal Cortical Excitatory Synapses in Schizophrenia",
      "content": "<p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Language Information Representation within the Left Inferior Parietal Lobule Network: An Intracranial SEEG Study",
      "content": "<p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

      "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",
