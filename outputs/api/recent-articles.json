      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

      "title": "Vascular Microbleeds Without Brain Atrophy: A Microvascular Signature of Mid-Stage 5xFAD Pathology",
      "content": "Cerebral microbleeds are increasingly recognized as a downstream manifestation of vascular injury in Alzheimer disease (AD), arising secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Here, we examined the pathological specificity of microbleeds by comparing an amyloidosis mouse model (5xFAD) with a small-vessel disease (SVD) model characterized by vascular smooth-muscle cell loss. In vivo multimodal MRI, including gradient-echo, spin-echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging, was complemented by ex vivo high-resolution anatomical scans for validation. Both in vivo and ex vivo gradient-echo MRI consistently revealed hippocampal microbleeds in the 5xFAD model without macroscopic atrophy or ventricular enlargement, whereas no microbleeds or blood-brain barrier disruption were detected in the SVD model. Diffusion-weighted MRI further showed region-specific alterations in apparent diffusion coefficient within the midbrain of 5xFAD mice, but not in other regions or in the SVD cohort. These findings indicate that microbleeds are a pathology-specific marker of amyloid-related vascular injury rather than a general indicator of small-vessel impairment. The combined imaging evidence underscores the potential of microbleeds as a disease-specific biomarker for detecting amyloid-driven vascular fragility and refining diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.",

      "title": "Microglial MyD88-dependent signaling influences extracellular matrix development and interneuron maturation in the hippocampus",
      "content": "Parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) are disrupted across diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting their vulnerability to developmental perturbations. Inflammation can perturb PVI development and function, and inflammatory mechanisms are often propagated within the brain by microglia. Yet the microglial mechanisms linking inflammatory signals to interneuron development are unclear. To test the role of microglial innate immune signaling in PVI development, we used mice lacking toll-like receptor adaptor MyD88 specifically in microglia. MyD88-deficient microglia showed reduced inflammatory responses but increased early-life phagocytosis of inhibitory synaptic material. In adulthood, males without microglial MyD88 exhibited increased hippocampal PVI density, increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, increased inhibitory signaling, and impaired discrimination behaviors. We determined the cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, which normally drives adult microglial remodeling of the ECM, is developmentally regulated in the hippocampus. MyD88-deficient microglia fail to respond to IL-33, leading to reduced remodeling of the ECM component aggrecan. These results reveal microglial immune signaling via MyD88 regulates hippocampal inhibitory circuit development in a sex-specific manner.",

      "content": "Learned associations between environmental cues and reward drive motivated behavior, yet how specific cell types support this process remains unclear. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked dorsal medial prefrontal cortical astrocytes throughout the acquisition, expression, and reversal of Pavlovian sucrose conditioning. As learning progressed, astrocytes exhibited time-locked, spatially coordinated calcium signals that differentiated correct behavioral action from mistakes, evolving from broad outcome encoding to selective representation of responses associated with the reward-conditioned stimulus. Omission testing revealed that prefrontal astrocytes preferentially respond to the cue-reward association, rather than the conditioned stimulus or reward alone. When reward contingencies were reversed, astrocytic activity rapidly adapted to track the new cue-reward association and encode updated and outdated motivated behavioral actions. Finally, astrocytic ablation attenuated motivated behavior during initial associative learning and prevented persistence of conditioned reward seeking when reward contingencies were updated or unpredictable. These findings reveal prefrontal astrocytes are functionally plastic elements that regulate reward-seeking behavior across associative learning.",

      "title": "Susceptibility-matched padding improves the quality of cervical and lumbar spinal fMRI",
      "content": "Spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has advanced significantly in recent years, revealing insights into the function of somatosensory and motor systems. However, the complex environment of the spinal cord induces unique sources of noise, limiting the quality of spinal fMRI recordings. Various hardware and software solutions have been proposed to address these challenges. Among them, susceptibility-matched padding has gained popularity due its low cost, ease of use, and effectiveness in reducing static B0 field inhomogeneities, which are a major source of artefacts in spinal fMRI. Despite anecdotal evidence, the impact of susceptibility-matched padding on the quality of spinal cord fMRI has not been assessed systematically. We investigated the effects of non-protonated perfluorocarbon liquid-filled padding (SatPad) on B0 field homogeneity and functional echo-planar imaging (EPI) in cervical and lumbar spinal cord in 10 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent two resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, one per cord section. Within each session they were scanned with and without SatPad in a pseudo-randomised order. The use of SatPad increased B0 field homogeneity and improved functional image quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio, timeseries coefficient of variation, DVARS, and ghosting artefacts. While both cervical and lumbar cord data benefited from the use of SatPad, greater effects were observed in the cervical cord. These findings provide a compelling basis for integrating susceptibility-matched padding into routine spinal fMRI protocols.",

      "title": "PLD1-Dependent Regulation of Synaptic Integrity: Implications for Cognitive Resilience and Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis",
      "content": "Dysregulation of Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study investigated PLD1 signaling in synaptic integrity and cognition during aging and in a late-onset AD mouse model, hypothesizing differential effects of PLD1 modulation on synaptic vulnerability. AAV2-mediated gene transfer was employed to overexpress (PLD1 OXP) or attenuate (PLD1 ATT) PLD1 in aged wild-type (WT) and 3xTg-AD mice. To validate these constructs, differentiated PC12 cells were utilized. Within these cells, a model of post-mitotic neurons, PLD1 OXP exhibited a notable reduction in both the average neurite length and the percentage of neurite-bearing cells. This suggests that elevated PLD1 activity exerts a significant influence on neurite outgrowth. Conversely, PLD1 ATT did not inhibit neurite formation, indicating it is not detrimental at the cellular level. These cellular findings paralleled in vivo observations - electrophysiological studies revealed PLD1 OXP impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission, particularly in aged WT mice, whereas PLD1 ATT improved synaptic function in 3xTg-AD mice. Behaviorally, PLD1 ATT enhanced spatial working memory and reduced anxiety-like behavior, notably in 3xTg-AD mice. These results highlight that tight PLD1 regulation is vital for maintaining synaptic integrity and cognitive resilience. Thus, PLD1 attenuation may serve as an important complement to immunotherapeutic approaches by strengthening synaptic resilience in neurodysfunctional states, including AD and related dementia (ADRD).",

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.
