I really liked Kindle's &quot;Word Wise&quot; feature, but it doesn't work on sideloaded books.</p> <p>So, I built Sura. It's a Python tool that injects ruby text definitions directly into EPUB files.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/watsuyo/Sura\">https://github.com/watsuyo/Sura</a></p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>Sura processes EPUB files to help language learners read more smoothly. Specifically, it:</p> <ol> <li>Extracts text from an EPUB file.</li> <li>Filters words based on difficulty using wordfreq (Zipf scores), so it only targets words you likely don't know.</li> <li>Generates definitions using an LLM (OpenAI/compatible API) to provide short, context-aware meanings.</li> <li>Injects ruby text (HTML/CSS) back into the EPUB structure.</li> <li>Rebuilds the EPUB, making it compatible with almost any e-reader (Kobo, Kindle, etc.).</li> </ol> <p>It uses asyncio for concurrent processing to keep performance reasonably fast.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This tool is meant for language learners who want to read native content without constant dictionary interruptions, and e-reader users (Kindle) who sideload their books.</p> <p>It is currently a hobby/open-source project intended for personal use and for developers interested in EPUB manipulation or LLM integration.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>The main alternative is Kindle's native &quot;Word Wise&quot; feature.</p> <p>Kindle Word Wise: Only works on books purchased directly from Amazon. It does not support sideloaded documents or other devices like Kobo.</p> <p>Sura: Works on any DRM-free EPUB file, allowing you to use the feature on sideloaded books and non-Kindle devices. It also allows for customizable difficulty thresholds, unlike the fixed settings on Kindle.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Classic_Method_5547\"> /u/Classic_Method_5547 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qff835/an_opensource_tool_to_add_word_wise_style/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qff835/an_opensource_tool_to_add_word_wise_style/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Mesa's new unified scheduling API: Rethinking how time works in agent-based models",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I'm one of the maintainers of <a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa\">Mesa</a>, the Python framework for agent-based modeling. We're working on a pretty significant change to how models handle time and event scheduling, and I think (hope) it's a cool demonstration of user API design.</p> <h3>The problem</h3> <p>Right now, Mesa has two separate systems for advancing time. The traditional approach looks like this:</p> <p><code>python model = MyModel() for _ in range(100): model.step() </code></p> <p>Simple, but limited. If you want discrete event simulation (where things happen at irregular intervals), you need to use our experimental <code>Simulator</code> classes: a completely separate API that feels (and is) bolted on rather than integrated.</p> <h3>The new approach</h3> <p>We're unifying everything into a single, clean API that lives directly on the Model. Here's what it looks like:</p> <p>```python from mesa import Model from mesa.timeflow import scheduled</p> <p>class WolfSheep(Model): @scheduled # Runs every 1 time unit by default def step(self): self.agents.shuffle_do(&quot;step&quot;)</p> <p>model = WolfSheep() model.run_for(100) # Run for 100 time units ```</p> <p>The <code>@scheduled</code> decorator marks methods for automatic recurring execution. You can customize the interval:</p> <p>```python @scheduled(interval=7) # Weekly def collect_statistics(self): ...</p> <p>@scheduled(interval=0.5) # Twice per time unit def physics_update(self): ... ```</p> <h3>Start simple, add complexity</h3> <p>The real power comes from mixing regular stepping with one-off events:</p> <p>```python class EpidemicModel(Model): def <strong>init</strong>(self): super().<strong>init</strong>() # Schedule a one-time event self.schedule_at(self.introduce_vaccine, time=50)</p> <pre><code>@scheduled def step(self): self.agents.shuffle_do(&quot;step&quot;) def introduce_vaccine(self): # This fires once at t=50 self.vaccine_available = True </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>Agents can even schedule their own future actions:</p> <p>```python class Prisoner(Agent): def get_arrested(self, sentence): self.in_jail = True self.model.schedule_after(self.release, delay=sentence)</p> <pre><code>def release(self): self.in_jail = False </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>And for pure discrete event simulation (no regular stepping at all):</p> <p>```python class QueueingModel(Model): def <strong>init</strong>(self, arrival<em>rate): super().</em><em>init</em>_() self.schedule_at(self.customer_arrival, time=0)</p> <pre><code>def customer_arrival(self): Customer(self) # Schedule next arrival (Poisson process) next_time = self.time + self.random.expovariate(arrival_rate) self.schedule_at(self.customer_arrival, time=next_time) </code></pre> <p>model = QueueingModel(arrival_rate=2.0) model.run_until(1000.0) # Time jumps: 0 \u2192 0.3 \u2192 0.8 \u2192 1.2... ```</p> <h3>Run control methods</h3> <p><code>python model.run_for(100) # Run for 100 time units model.run_until(500) # Run until time reaches 500 model.run_while(lambda m: m.running) # Run while condition is true model.run_next_event() # Step through events one at a time </code></p> <h3>Design considerations</h3> <p>We kept in mind our wide user base: both students who just starting to learn ABM and PhD-level research. We try to allow progressive complexity: Start simple with <code>@scheduled</code> + <code>run_for()</code>, add events as needed</p> <p>There's now no more second tier: both paradigms are a first-class citizen</p> <p>What's also cool that agents can schedule their own future actions naturally, not everything has to be controlled centrally. This leads to complex patterns and emergent behavior (a very important concept in ABM).</p> <p>Finally we're quite proud that's it's fully backward compatible, that was very hard to get right.</p> <h3>Current status</h3> <p>This is in active development (<a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/3155\">PR #3155</a>), so any insights (both on the specific PR and on a higher level) are appreciated!</p> <p>The (extensive) design discussion is in <a href=\"https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2921\">#2921</a> if you want to dive deeper.</p> <p>If you're more interested in the process of designing a new API in a larger community for a library with a varied user base, we recently wrote up our perspective on that: <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#mesa-development-process\">Mesa development process</a>.</p> <h3>What's next</h3> <p>We're also <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/discussions/2921#discussioncomment-15524497\">designing</a> a more advanced <code>schedule()</code> method for complex patterns:</p> <p>```python</p> <h1>Poisson arrivals with stochastic intervals</h1> <p>model.schedule(customer_arrival, interval=lambda m: m.random.expovariate(2.0))</p> <h1>Run only during market hours, stop after 100 executions</h1> <p>model.schedule(trade, interval=1, only_if=lambda m: m.market_open, count=100)</p> <h1>Seasonal events</h1> <p>@scheduled(interval=1, only_if=lambda m: 90 &lt;= m.time % 365 &lt; 180) def breeding_season(self): ... ```</p> <p>I hope you guys find something like this interesting and it will lead to fruitful a discussion!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf9ns8/mesas_new_unified_scheduling_api_rethinking_how/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qf9ns8/mesas_new_unified_scheduling_api_rethinking_how/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
      "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",
