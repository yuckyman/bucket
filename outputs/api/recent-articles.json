      "title": "Beyond Agreement: Standardizing Crowdsourced Synapse Annotations through Proofreading in EM Connectomics",
      "content": "Reliable synapse identification in volumetric EM is hampered by subtle, 3D cues that yield variable human judgments. We present a standardized proofreading protocol that pairs explicit, operational criteria with machine-learning candidate generation and a two-stage calibration of annotators. In two larval Drosophila melanogaster volumes imaged at 8x8x8 nm, five raters (expert + 4 calibrated annotators) reviewed model-proposed candidates using efficient node-based labels. Multi-rater judgments were aggregated with a probabilistic Dawid-Skene (DS) model to produce consensus labels with calibrated uncertainty. Post-calibration, individual annotator accuracy versus the expert improved (McNemar p<0.05 for all raters), DS-expert agreement increased, and DS posterior entropy decreased for true positives/negatives, indicating more decisive consensus; gains were modest and dataset-dependent in chance-corrected agreement (Krippendorff's ). By making uncertainty explicit, this protocol converts noisy judgments into auditable supervision suitable for training and evaluation, while honestly communicating residual ambiguity essential for reliable and robust connectomics at scale.",

      "title": "Effects of asymmetrical postural demands on sternocleidomastoid reflex in the startReact paradigm",
      "content": "IntroductionstartReact, the rapid release of a planned movement following a startling acoustic stimulus (usually >100 dB), is widely used to assess reticulospinal tract (RST) involvement in motor control. The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) reflex within 120 ms often identifies true startle responses, i.e., responses facilitated by RSTs in the absence of cortical control. However, as the SCM is a postural muscle, its reflexive activation may be influenced by inhibitory anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), particularly during tasks with greater head/neck postural demands.MethodsWe compared SCM activation during unilateral shoulder abduction (SABD) versus hand opening (OPEN) tasks. Due to the increased asymmetrical head/neck postural demands in SABD, we hypothesized an APA-induced delay in SCM activation during SABD compared to the OPEN task, with a contralateral bias due to contralateral cortical circuits triggering APAs.ResultsOur results revealed significantly longer SCM latency\u2014exceeding the 120 ms cutoff\u2014during SABD relative to OPEN. This suggested that APAs during postural tasks, resulting from unilateral SABD, altered the expression of the startReact response. To confirm this finding, we implemented an innovative, data-driven method to determine the appropriate SCM cutoff based on the physiological difference between startle-induced SCM reflexes and task-induced SCM activation. Using this method, we observed reduced contralateral SCM reflexive activation compared to ipsilateral, during SABD but not in OPEN.DiscussionThis provides evidence for the first time that SCM reflexive activation in startReact is posture-dependent. Our novel classification method offers a robust framework for identifying true startle responses across different tasks, offering broader applicability for studies investigating RST involvement in motor control.",

      "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
      "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",

Sensory substitution, achieved through tactile displays embedded in transfemoral prosthetic sockets, presents a promising non-invasive solution to provide artificial sensation to users. However, for this approach to be effective, users must accurately perceive distinct combinations of vibrations, a capacity limited by their...",
