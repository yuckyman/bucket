      "title": "Towards Video-LLM Driven Workflow for Behavioral Segmentation and Scoring in Mice Performing a Skilled Water Reaching Task: An Evaluation of Recent LLM Models",
      "content": "Significance: Behavior scoring is labor-intensive and subjective, introducing variability in results. Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area. In 549/1058 of videos, Gemini 2.5 Pro also provided completely accurate frame-to- frame behaviour segmentations. Conclusions: Video-LLMs offer potential to accelerate neuroscience by providing scalable, objective quantification of goal-directed behaviors. By producing temporal annotations, Gemini enables fast first-pass labelling that markedly streamlines manual dataset curation.",

      "title": "MRS4Brain: a processing toolbox for preclinical MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging data",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique for probing metabolism and underpins advanced methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS). MRSI enables spatial mapping of metabolite distributions, offering insights into regional metabolic heterogeneity that single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) cannot capture. However, MRSI produces large multidimensional datasets and requires complex processing pipelines, limiting reproducibility and accessibility. While human studies benefit from advanced processing tools, similar developments in preclinical research remain scarce, highlighting a demand for practical tools accessible to non-experts. To address this need, we introduce the MRS4Brain Toolbox, a freely available MATLAB-based platform for preclinical spectroscopy, including MRSI, SVS, and DWS. The toolbox integrates reconstruction, preprocessing, quantification, quality control, brain segmentation automatically overlaid on metabolite maps, modeling, and statistical analysis into unified workflows accessible via a graphical interface. By streamlining data processing and reducing technical barriers, MRS4Brain Toolbox promotes reproducibility, harmonization, and broader adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in preclinical studies, ultimately facilitating translational research.",

      "title": "Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging in the ex vivo macaque brain on a 10.5T human MRI scanner",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI provides a non-invasive probe of local fibre bundles and long-range anatomical connections to characterise the structural connectome. One way to achieve very high spatial resolution diffusion MRI data for connectivity investigations is to scan ex-vivo brains over many hours or days, ideally at ultra-high field strength to boost signal levels. However, conventional diffusion MRI acquisition techniques do not generally deliver good data quality for the challenging conditions of ex-vivo tissue, characterised by reduced diffusivities and relaxation times when compared to in vivo. In this work, we investigate the potential of the diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) sequence for ex vivo diffusion imaging of the macaque brain using a 10.5 T human MRI scanner with a conventional (G_max=70 mT/m) gradient set. SNR-efficiency optimisations incorporating experimental relaxation times demonstrate that the DW-SSFP sequence is predicted to achieve improved or similar SNR efficiency compared to a diffusion-weighted spin- and stimulated-echo sequence. Importantly, DW-SSFP can achieve this with the additional benefit of negligible geometric distortions, unlike conventional diffusion MRI using an echo-planar imaging readout. Using optimised DW-SSFP sequence parameters, we propose a protocol at 0.4 mm isotropic resolution using a two-shell multi-orientation protocol (effective b-values of 3200 s/mm^2 and 5600 s/mm^2). We fit the data using Tensor, Ball and 3-Sticks and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution signal representations. The results demonstrate high-quality diffusivity estimates across the entire brain with the ability to resolve multiple fibre populations in challenging crossing-fibre regions. The data will be made fully open source and multimodal as part of the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics, providing a resource for future connectivity investigations.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "title": "Rehabilitation drives functional reorganization of intact corticospinal-supraspinal projections following partial spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity and impairs skilled voluntary movement, yet most human SCIs are anatomically incomplete, allowing spared CST pathways to engage in rehabilitation-mediated plasticity to promote functional recovery. How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery. These findings identify a set of spinally-projecting medullary nuclei as key substrates for rehabilitation-induced CST plasticity and highlight the MdV as a potential mediator of restored motor function. This work defines how voluntary rehabilitation reorganizes spared corticospinal pathways and provides targets for optimizing activity-based interventions after SCI.",

      "content": "Delirium is a frequent and serious complication in intensive care patients, arising from overlapping vulnerabilities that obscure its primary causes. Using healthy mice, we tested whether mechanical ventilation combined with inhalation anesthetics and opioid sedation is sufficient to induce delirium-like behavior through disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glymphatic dynamics. We found that ventilation acutely increased intracranial pressure and induced a long-lasting suppression of glymphatic transport, thereby re-routing and impairing brain waste clearance and promoting cytokine accumulation. These observations establish a mechanistic link between ventilator-associated alterations in brain fluid dynamics and delirium. Our findings identify glymphatic dysfunction and disturbed CSF flow as contributors to acute brain dysfunction following mechanical ventilation and suggest that therapies enhancing glymphatic flux or stabilizing intracranial pressure could reduce delirium incidence and severity in critically ill patients.",

      "title": "Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure differentially alters acute ethanol sensitivity of GABAergic transmission in CRFR1- and CRFR1+ CeM neurons",
      "content": "Prenatal exposure to alcohol (PAE) increases the risk for misusing alcohol and/or developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) by adulthood. The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system is a major target of pre- and post-natal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. CRF and its receptor (CRFR1), in part, mediate EtOH potentiated GABA release in the medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) of adult male rodents. Interestingly, our lab has shown a disruption in the function and expression of CeM CRFR1 and acute EtOH's effects on GABA transmission in PAE adolescent animals, but it is unknown whether these alterations to the CRF system persist into adulthood or alter the actions of acute EtOH on GABAergic transmission in the CeM. Using CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats, this study examined how moderate PAE alters acute EtOH modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- CeM neurons in adult offspring (P80-105). Pregnant dams were exposed to vaporized ethanol or room air (control) on gestational day 12 (G12) for 6 hours and whole-cell electrophysiology was performed in the CeM to assess the actions of acute EtOH (44, 66, & 88 mM) on GABAergic transmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- neurons. We found unique effects of PAE that were cell type- and concentration-dependent in males and females, suggesting PAE dysregulates acute EtOH's modulation of GABA transmission within the CeM in a sex-specific manner. This study contributes to the expanding body of research exploring the effects of PAE and how a single exposure can impact neurophysiological mechanisms in brain regions associated with AUD.",

      "title": "Show HN: Zenflow \u2013 orchestrate coding agents without \"you're right\" loops",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Andrew, Founder of Zencoder.<p>While building our IDE extensions and cloud agents, we ran into the same issue many of you likely face when using coding agents in complex repos: agents getting stuck in loops, apologizing, and wasting time.<p>We tried to manage this with scripts, but juggling terminal windows and copy-paste prompting was painful. So we built Zenflow, a free desktop tool to orchestrate AI coding workflows.<p>It handles the things we were missing in standard chat interfaces:<p>Cross-Model Verification: You can have Codex review Claude\u2019s code, or run them in parallel to see which model handles the specific context better.<p>Parallel Execution: Run five different approaches on a backlog item simultaneously\u2014mix \"Human-in-the-Loop\" for hard problems with \"YOLO\" runs for simple tasks.<p>Dynamic Workflows: Configured via simple .md files. Agents can actually \"rewire\" the next steps of the workflow dynamically based on the problem at hand.<p>Project list/kanban views across all workload<p>What we learned building this<p>To tune Zenflow, we ran 100+ experiments across public benchmarks (SWE-Bench-*, T-Bench) and private datasets. Two major takeaways that might interest this community:<p>Benchmark Saturation: Models are becoming progressively overtrained on all versions of SWE-Bench (even Pro). We found public results are diverging significantly from performance on private datasets. If you are building workflows, you can't rely on public benches.<p>The \"Goldilocks\" Workflow: In autonomous mode, heavy multi-step processes often multiply errors rather than fix them. Massive, complex prompt templates look good on paper but fail in practice. The most reliable setups landed in a narrow \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone of just enough structure without over-orchestration.<p>The app is free to use and supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Zencoder.<p>We\u2019ve been dogfooding this heavily, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the default workflows and if they fit your mental model for agentic coding.<p>Download: <a href=\"https://zencoder.ai/zenflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zencoder.ai/zenflow</a>\nYT flyby: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "People report having consistent idiosyncratic diets of imagined sensations when they re-experience the past, and pre-experience the future",
      "content": "To some extent, humans can re-experience the sensations of past events and pre-experience the future. These capacities are inter-related. But there are substantial individual differences. At the extremes, small minorities of people report that they either cannot have imagined experiences at all, or that their imagined sensations are as real to them as their actual experiences of the physical world. We wanted to know if such individual differences are uniform across different types of imagined experience (e.g. vision, audio, taste and smell), or if people generally have idiosyncratic patterns of different types (vision, audio, taste and smell) of imagined experiences. We find that people report having idiosyncratic diets of different types of imagined sensation, characterised by differences in salience. One person might have more salient imagined visual than taste experiences, while another reports the reverse. Moreover, these propensities are consistent across peoples attempts to re-experience the past, and to pre-experience the future, and they predict peoples experience and usage of different types of imagined sensation in their everyday lives.",
