      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What event2vec Project Does</h1> <p>I\u2019ve been working on my Python library, Event2Vector (event2vec), for embedding event sequences (logs, clickstreams, POS tags, life\u2011event sequences, etc.) into vectors in a way that is easy to inspect and reason about.</p> <p>Instead of a complex RNN/transformer, the model uses a simple additive recurrent update: the hidden state for a sequence is constrained to behave like the sum of its event embeddings (the \u201clinear additive hypothesis\u201d). This makes sequence trajectories geometrically interpretable and supports vector arithmetic on histories (e.g., A \u2212 B + C style analogies on event trajectories).</p> <p>From the Python side, you primarily interact with a scikit\u2011learn\u2011style estimator:</p> <pre><code>python from event2vector import Event2Vec model = Event2Vec( num_event_types=len(vocab), geometry=&quot;euclidean&quot;, # or &quot;hyperbolic&quot; embedding_dim=128, pad_sequences=True, num_epochs=50, ) model.fit(train_sequences, verbose=True) embeddings = model.transform(train_sequences) </code></pre> <p>There are both Euclidean and hyperbolic (Poincar\u00e9 ball) variants, so you can choose flat vs hierarchical geometry for your event space.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Python users working with discrete event sequences: logs, clickstreams, POS tags, user journeys, synthetic processes, etc.</p> <p>E.g. posts about shopping patterns <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue\">https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue</a> or geometry of languages <a href=\"https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families\">https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families</a></p> <p>People who want interpretable, geometric representations of sequences rather than just \u201cit works but I can\u2019t see what it\u2019s doing.\u201d</p> <p>It is currently more of a research/analysis tool and prototyping library than a fully battle\u2011hardened production system, but:</p> <p>It is MIT\u2011licensed and on PyPI (<code>pip install event2vector</code>).</p> <p>It has a scikit\u2011style API (<code>fit</code>, <code>fit_transform</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>most_similar</code>) and optional padded batching + GPU support, so it should drop into many Python ML workflows.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><strong>Versus Word2Vec and similar context\u2011window models:</strong></p> <p>Word2Vec is excellent for capturing local co\u2011occurrence and semantic similarity, but it does not model the ordered trajectory of a sequence; contexts are effectively treated as bags of neighbors.</p> <p>Event2Vector, in contrast, explicitly treats the hidden state as an ordered sum of event embeddings, and its training objective enforces that likely future events lie along the trajectory of that sum. This lets it capture sequential structure and trajectory geometry that Word2Vec is not designed to represent.</p> <p>In the paper, an unsupervised experiment on the Brown Corpus shows that Event2Vector\u2019s additive sequence embeddings produce clearer clusters of POS\u2011tag patterns than a Word2Vec baseline when you compose tag sequences and visualize them.</p> <p><strong>Versus generic RNNs / LSTMs / transformers:</strong></p> <p>Those models are more expressive and often better for pure prediction, but their hidden states are usually hard to interpret geometrically.</p> <p>Event2Vector intentionally trades some expressivity for a simple, reversible additive structure: sequences are trajectories in a space where addition/subtraction have a clear meaning, and you can inspect them with PCA/t\u2011SNE or do analogical reasoning.</p> <h1>Python\u2011centric details</h1> <ul> <li>Install: <code>pip install event2vector</code> </li> <li>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec_public/tree/main\">https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec_public/tree/main</a></li> </ul> <p>Accepts integer\u2011encoded sequences (Python lists / tensors), with optional padding for minibatching.</p> <p>Provides a tiny synthetic quickstart (START\u2192A/B\u2192C\u2192END) that trains in seconds on CPU and plots embeddings with matplotlib, plus a Brown Corpus POS example that mirrors the paper.</p> <p>I\u2019d love feedback from the Python side on:</p> <p>Whether the estimator/API design feels natural.</p> <p>What examples or utilities you\u2019d want for real\u2011world logs / clickstreams.</p> <p>Any obvious packaging or ergonomics improvements that would make you more likely to try it in your own projects.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sulcantonin\"> /u/sulcantonin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgaac2/i_built_event2vector_a_scikitstyle_library_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qgaac2/i_built_event2vector_a_scikitstyle_library_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It also includes a dashboard + timeline view to inspect requests, failures, and slow calls, and supports capturing httpx, requests, SQLAlchemy, and Redis.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> Python developers building FastAPI/Flask services who want a simpler way to reproduce staging/production issues locally, debug faster, and create repeatable test scenarios from real requests.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> There are existing tools that record/replay HTTP calls (like VCR-style approaches), and other tools focused on tracing/observability. TimeTracer is my attempt to combine record/replay with API debugging workflows and a simple dashboard/timeline, especially for services that talk to external APIs, databases, and Redis.</p> <p><strong>Install</strong><br /> pip install timetracer</p> <p><strong>GitHub</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/usv240/timetracer\">https://github.com/usv240/timetracer</a></p> <p>Contributions welcome, if anyone\u2019s interested in helping (features, tests, docs, or new integrations), I\u2019d love the support.</p> <p><strong>Looking for feedback:</strong> what would make you actually use something like this, pytest integration, better diffing, or more framework support?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/usv240\"> /u/usv240 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qflvmi/i_built_timetracer_recordreplay_api_calls_locally/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qflvmi/i_built_timetracer_recordreplay_api_calls_locally/\">[comments]</a></span>",
