      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Mu opioid receptor mRNA and protein localization across the rat and mouse habenula",
      "content": "The habenula (Hb), which contains medial and lateral subdivisions (MHb and LHb, respectively), has high intensity mu opioid binding and receptor (MOR) expression, yet the details of MOR localization across these regions remains debated. MHb and LHb participate in largely non-overlapping neural circuits, therefore accurately resolving MOR expression across MHb and LHb is critical for understanding how MOR ligands impact behaviors. Here we utilized in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to systematically map Oprm1 mRNA and MOR protein throughout the habenular complex. We studied both rat and mouse tissue to evaluate conserved expression across two common research species. Importantly, we found mRNA and protein in both the MHb and LHb in both. In rat, 39 {+/-} 3% (MHb) and 21 {+/-} 4% (LHb) of cells expressed Oprm1. These proportions were greater in mouse: 57 {+/-} 1% (MHb) and 32 {+/-} 4% (LHb). Within each species, Oprm1 labeling density per positive cell was greater in MHb compared to LHb (p < 0.0001 for rat and mouse). The highest intensity labeling was localized along the lateral edge of the MHb for both methods. ICC showed MOR localized to fibers and somata in MHb and LHb. In LHb, MOR labeling was most dense in intermediate sections along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. In rats we also observed higher density labeling in dorsal LHb at intermediate AP levels and medial LHb more posteriorly. These results indicate that both MHb and LHb can contribute to MOR mediated actions through their respective circuits.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "Objective. Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we aimed to estimate spiking activity in the visual cortex using non-invasive scalp EEG. Approach. We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials. We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Main results. Although the relationship between these spectrotemporal features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, they were reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Significance. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG provides information on underlying spiking activity beyond what is available when only the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.",

      "content": "Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies. This article represents a synthesis of scientific, engineering, and clinical viewpoints to inform key stakeholders in the neuromodulation and brain-computer interface spaces.",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",
