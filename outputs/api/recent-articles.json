      "title": "Adaptation response to pitch shift during speech is attenuated upon relearning",
      "content": "IntroductionDuring sensorimotor adaptation, participants respond to a persistent sensory error by shifting behavior to oppose the error. This phenomenon has been measured in multiple motor tasks in which sensory feedback is experimentally altered to artificially introduce an error. Tasks involving multiple cycles of altered and unaltered feedback have been used in the arm reaching domain to understand the mechanisms of un-learning and re-learning a response to an error, but re-learning within a single session has not been studied in the domain of fundamental frequency (f0) control during speech.MethodsIn this study, participants responded to three alternating blocks of f0-shifted and unshifted auditory feedback during a single-word speech task.ResultsIt was found that on average, adaptation magnitude decreased in the second and third blocks of shifted feedback compared to the first. This illustrates an attenuation effect similar to that observed in studies of implicit learning in arm reaching tasks.DiscussionThese results support the understanding of f0 control as an implicit learning phenomenon and help place f0 control in the context of motor control in general.",

      "title": "Pattern-induced visual discomfort and its cumulative effects revealed by pupillary measures",
      "content": "IntroductionViewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as potential physiological indicator of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports.MethodsAcross four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5\u20133 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size.ResultsHigher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an indicator of visual discomfort, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear.DiscussionOverall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry's potential as a sensitive, physiological tool for assessing visual sensitivity.",

      "title": "The association of hemoglobin levels and balance function in patients with stroke: a multicenter study in China",
      "content": "BackgroundBalance impairment following stroke is a leading cause of disability and falls. Hemoglobin (Hb) affects systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery and may influence neuromuscular function and post-stroke balance, but evidence from large multicenter clinical samples is limited. We investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration and balance performance in a Chinese multicenter cross-sectional study of stroke patients.MethodsWe studied 2,006 neuroimaging-confirmed stroke patients from 26 hospitals. Balance impairment was defined as BBS\u202f\u2264\u202f40. Admission Hb (g/dL) was analyzed per 1\u202fg/dL and by tertiles (<12.6\u202fg/dL, 12.6\u201314.0\u202fg/dL, \u226514.0\u202fg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression with sequential adjustment, restricted cubic splines, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated associations.ResultsBalance impairment occurred in 70.5% (1,414/2,006). Each 1\u202fg/dL higher Hb was associated with lower odds of impairment in unadjusted (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.87; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). This association remained robust after comprehensive adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, stroke characteristics, and lesion location factors. Compared with the lowest tertile, adjusted ORs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) for the middle tertile and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.003) for the highest tertile. Spline analyses suggested a broadly linear inverse association; results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity checks.ConclusionHigher admission hemoglobin was independently associated with better balance after stroke. Prospective studies should test whether Hb optimization improves rehabilitation outcomes.",

      "title": "Neural correlation between swallowing motor imagery and execution: an EEG analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",

      "content": "This perspective article explores the transformative potential of brain\u2013Computer Interfaces (BCI) in undergraduate systems engineering programs, a domain characterized by high attrition and a widening gap between rapid technological innovation and slower pedagogical change. I argue that BCI, by enabling real-time detection of cognitive states such as mental workload, attention, and frustration, can evolve from laboratory tools to central pedagogical instruments for adaptive, student-centered education. I review the state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the technical feasibility of low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices and machine learning algorithms that classify cognitive states with high accuracy in controlled settings. Building on this evidence, I outline concrete applications in three dimensions: formative assessment, dynamic curricular adaptation, and cognitive inclusion, with a specific emphasis on preventing dropout in foundational courses such as algorithms. I also examine ethical, technical, and pedagogical challenges, and propose a scalable, ethically grounded pilot model tailored for universities, particularly in Latin America. This study reports no empirical results. It synthesizes the existing evidence and proposes a roadmap for research and educational action.",

When these two fingers span the disk to contact its perimeter, a finger configuration cue (the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may result from the indentation of finger pads caused by the disk's curvature. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the most reliable cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimal Model, OPT) in which more reliable cues exert proportionately greater influence on the percept. In three experiments involving 34 participants, we compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with the cutaneous index finger cue, cutaneous thumb cue, and finger configuration cue individually and with the three cues together. The three experiments were designed to have progressively greater resolution to distinguish the relevant models from one another. In Experiments 1 and 2, the disks were circular. Experiment 3 included non-circular cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy in multi-cue conditions, and perceptual effects of cue-conflict stimuli, were broadly consistent with optimal cue combination. Eight of 12 participants were classified as OPT in Experiment 1; eight of 11 in Experiment 2; and 10 of 11 in Experiment 3. The mean confidence of OPT classifications was 0.56, 0.61, and 0.98, respectively. We conclude that humans combine haptic cues optimally to judge the sizes of held objects.",

      "content": "Founders of quantum mechanics (QM) anticipated that revisions to classical physics due to strange elements of quantum reality, would necessitate similar changes in biology. Complexity theory, systems biology and quantum biology provide possible solutions indicating that subject/object separation is a useful fiction for reductive science. Direct correlates to such QM observational/measurement issues as Complementarity and Uncertainty may justify the introduction of an analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty and the Planck constant for living systems. The phase space of \u201cadjacent possibles\u201d for biological systems from which one \u201cactual\u201d is selected resembles the collapse of the QM wave function. Since biological systems are hierarchical, this occurs across organizational scales resulting in biological coherence. The location of a quantum/classical boundary is unclear due to complexity. Whether biological systems' characteristics arise directly from QM or are of a different origin remains unsettled. To combine non-linear with quantum properties across biological scales we propose the Method of Coherent Structures (MCS), developed for quantum many-body systems. In MCS, a higher-level scale provides a classical envelope for quantum fluctuations at the lower scale. It yields a seamless transition from non-linear classical fields to quantum excitations and accounts for the emergence of complexity by incorporating metabolic energy supply.",

      "content": "The pathological basis underlying mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced long-term cognitive impairment is not fully understood. It is supposed that mTBI induces residential microglia activation rather than peripheral leukocyte infiltration to promote neuroinflammation, thus triggering myelin damage as well as cognitive impairment. The transformation of microglia towards a pro-inflammatory (M1 type) or anti-inflammatory (M2 type) state is critical for restraining the cerebral inflammatory response to acute or chronic insults. In addition to classical M1- and M2-like phenotypes, a specific subgroup of microglia, which is referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM), the transition of which is regulated by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), is also demonstrated to play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases sharing similar pathological procedures to mTBI. The expression and function of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in microglia vary depending on the type and severity of the specific pathological stimuli. In the current study, we investigated whether peripheral leukocytes infiltrated the brain following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using a CX3CR1- and CCR2-double transgenic reporter mouse model. We also examined whether M1- or M2-like microglia exhibited a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype after mTBI, as indicated by their Trem2 expression. Then we explored the expression of p75NTR in M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia after mTBI and its modulating effects on the activation of Trem2 positive M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia, neuroinflammatory reaction, myelin damage, and cognitive performance. We found that most of the activated residential microglia after mTBI were Trem2 positive and p75NTR expression was significantly elevated in Trem2-positive M1-type microglia post-mTBI, correlating with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release, demyelination, and cognitive deficits. Pharmacological blockade of p75NTR using the antagonist TAT-Pep5 suppressed M1 microglial activation, reduced neuroinflammation, and restored myelin integrity, leading to marked improvements in cognitive function. Mechanistically, p75NTR exhibited a cell-type-specific regulatory role in neuroinflammatory responses, potentially through interacting with Trem2 to modulate DAM-like microglia activation. These findings highlight p75NTR as a key mediator of mTBI-induced neuropathology and propose its inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate secondary neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.",

      "content": "IntroductionBuratti-Harel syndrome (BURHAS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by SIAH1 (Siah1 E3 ubiquitin ligase) variants, characterized by infantile hypotonia, global developmental delay, and variable multisystem involvement. To date, 13 pathogenic SIAH1 variants have been reported in 13 patients, but the functional and phenotypic implications of mutations in the SIAH1 zinc finger domain remain poorly characterized. This study included a Chinese pediatric patient with unexplained neurodevelopmental and multisystem abnormalities.MethodsTrio whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify potential causative variants. Structural modeling was used to analyze the impact of the identified variant on SIAH1 protein structure. Additionally, a comparative genotype-phenotype analysis was conducted on 14 genetically confirmed BURHAS cases (including the present patient).ResultsA de novo missense variant [c.288C > G (p.Phe96Leu)] in the zinc finger domain of SIAH1 was identified in the patient. Structural modeling revealed that this variant destabilized the zinc finger domain (DDG = \u20132.09 kcal/mol), which may disrupt the ZnF-1 domain function by impairing zinc ion-mediated structural stability. Comparative analysis of 14 genetically confirmed cases (including this study) demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation: zinc finger domain variants (n = 4) exhibited broader phenotypic heterogeneity compared to RING domain variants (n = 7), which were enriched for severe developmental delay and reproductive anomalies.DiscussionThis study expands the mutational spectrum of SIAH1-associated disorders. We advocate for the inclusion of SIAH1 in diagnostic panels for patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders and multisystem dysmorphisms.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03023v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Medical conversational AI (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development of safer and more effective medical dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items (\"must-ask\" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.02559v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Despite growing awareness of ethical challenges in software development, practitioners still lack structured tools that help them critically engage with the lived experiences of marginalized users. This paper presents PerspectiveCoach, a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational tool designed to guide developers through structured perspective-taking exercises and deepen critical reflection on how software design decisions affect marginalized communities. Through a controlled study with 18 front-end developers (balanced by sex), who interacted with the tool using a real case of online gender-based harassment, we examine how PerspectiveCoach supports ethical reasoning and engagement with user perspectives. Qualitative analysis revealed increased self-awareness, broadened perspectives, and more nuanced ethical articulation, while a complementary human-human study contextualized these findings. Text similarity analyses demonstrated that participants in the human-PerspectiveCoach study improved the fidelity of their restatements over multiple attempts, capturing both surface-level and semantic aspects of user concerns. However, human-PerspectiveCoach's restatements had a lower baseline than the human-human conversations, highlighting contextual differences in impersonal and interpersonal perspective-taking. Across the study, participants rated the tool highly for usability and relevance. This work contributes an exploratory design for LLM-powered end-user perspective-taking that supports critical, ethical self-reflection and offers empirical insights (i.e., enhancing adaptivity, centering plurality) into how such tools can help practitioners build more inclusive and socially responsive technologies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.03225v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although automated trucks have the potential to improve freight efficiency, reduce costs, and address driver shortages, organizing two or more trucks in a convoy has raised considerable concerns for pedestrian safety. This study conducted a controlled experiment to examine the influence of behavioral tendency, trust, and risk perception on pedestrian intention to cross in front of an automated truck platoon. A total of 603 subjects participated in the virtual reality video-based questionnaire survey. By fusing the merits of structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks, a two-stage, hybrid model was developed to examine complex relationships between latent variables and gap-acceptance behaviors. Our results indicated that subjects watched an average of five vehicle gaps before starting crossing and the average time gap accepted was about 5.35 seconds. Risk perception not only played the most dominant role in shaping pedestrian crossing decisions, but also served as the strong bone, mediating the effects of behavioral tendency and trust on gap-acceptance. Participants who frequently violated traffic rules were more likely to accept a smaller time gap, while those who showed positive behaviors to other road users tended to wait for a larger time gap. Participants who often committed errors, showed aggressive behaviors, and held greater trust in the safety of automated trucks generally reported a lower level of risk for road-crossing in front of automated truck platoons. Built on these findings, a range of tailored countermeasures were proposed to ensure safer and smother interactions between pedestrians and automated truck platoons.",

External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to examine how different types of eHMIs displayed on AVs affect the crossing behavior of pedestrians in multi-lane streets environments, with a focus on the gaze patterns of pedestrians during crossing. The results revealed that the presence of eHMIs significantly influenced the cognitive load on pedestrians and increased the possibility of distraction, even misleading pedestrians in cases involving multiple AVs on multi-lane streets. Notably, allocentric eHMIs induced higher cognitive loads and greater distraction in pedestrians than egocentric eHMIs. This was primarily evidenced by longer gaze time and higher proportions of attention for the eHMI on the interacting vehicle, as well as a broader distribution of gaze toward vehicles in the non-interacting lane. However, misleading behavior was mainly triggered by eHMI signals from yielding vehicles in the non-interacting lane. Under such asymmetric signal configurations, egocentric eHMIs resulted in a higher misjudgment rate than allocentric eHMIs. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing eHMI designs to balance the clarity and consistency of the displayed information across different perspectives, especially in complex multi-lane traffic scenarios. This study provides valuable insights regarding the application and standardization of future eHMI systems for AVs.",
