      "title": "Low-grade inflammation in obesity causes low-effort food choice",
      "content": "Inflammation relates to decreased effortful behaviour and altered effort-related responses in brain regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Inflammation is prevalent in obesity, but its effects on effortful versus more convenient food choices are unknown. We investigated the role of low-grade inflammation in effortful food choice using functional MRI in a cross-sectional study (n=150 women, BMI>27 kg/m2) and a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n=59 women, BMI>30 kg/m2, CRP>3 mg/L; colchicine 0.5 mg/d vs. placebo). Inflammation was related to less high-effort choices (OR=0.27, p=0.004) and higher effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=0.23, p=0.025, Rpartial2=0.039), and mediated the association between BMI and dmPFC signal. Colchicine decreased systemic inflammation (i.e. INFLA-score) as expected ({beta}=-0.10 SD, p<0.001, Rpartial2=0.030), increased high-effort choices (OR=1.32, p=0.044), and marginally decreased effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=-0.13, p=0.053, Rpartial2=0.037). These findings show a causal role for inflammation in choosing convenience foods in obesity via increased effort aversion and associated dmPFC processing.",

      "title": "When Velocity Becomes Position: Proprioceptive Contributions to State Estimation",
      "content": "In this study, we investigate the relative contributions of positional- and velocity-based proprioceptive feedback to state estimation when visual feedback of the hand is unavailable. We performed a virtual reality experiment in which healthy human participants (N = 22) completed two tasks: a continuous target-tracking task and a sequential reaching task. In both cases, visual feedback of the hand position was withheld, except for a brief moment, during which an offset to the left or right was sometimes applied. By analysing the movement path following the offset visual feedback and comparing it to the non-offset condition, we can infer the extent to which the brain relies on rate-of-change feedback compared to absolute positional feedback for estimating the hand position. We compare and contrast our empirical data with simulated movements from a computational model based on Bayesian sensory integration under varied assumptions of the reliance on positional and velocity-based cues. Our human and simulated data together indicate a heavy reliance on velocity-based proprioceptive feedback, as movement offsets induced by biased visual feedback decay slowly during both target tracking and sequential reaching tasks. The eventual convergence between offset and non-offset trials demonstrates that absolute positional information is incorporated, albeit at a slow rate.",

      "title": "Harmonizing the stimulation dose of focal tDCS across target sites",
      "content": "Non-invasive brain stimulation is an established tool for modulating neural activity that holds promise for advancing both cognitive neuroscience and clinical interventions. Focal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), using center-surround electrode montages, enables more region-specific targeting. Although computational models can simulate individual electric fields, no existing approach enables the prospective individualization of electrode placement while standardizing the dose across targeted brain regions. In the current preparatory methodological study, we present a modeling-based framework that harmonizes the electric field strength between different target regions at the group level, but preserves inter-individual variability. This enables systematic examination of dose-response relationships and their regional differences. Positioning of the center-surround electrode montages is individualized to ensure focusing of the electric field on the target regions. We started by defining brain targets for eight cognitive and motor functions using MRI data from 43 participants. Using field simulations, we then estimated a group-average field strength in the target regions that had led to behavioral and physiological effects in prior tDCS studies (resulting in 0.2 V/m). The radii of the center-surround montages were optimized for each target region to achieve the intended field strength while maximizing focality. Validation in an independent sample (n=53) confirmed that the intended target field strength is achieved on average for new participants. The described computational tools are made available as open-source software, allowing other researchers to apply our individualization framework with parameters (target regions and target field strengths) tailored to their specific research questions; and are currently being implemented in a multi-center study involving approximately 1,000 datasets.",

      "title": "Emergent critical oscillations in motor cortex of Parkinson's patients",
      "content": "The dynamical state of cortical neural activity constrains the complexity of functions it can perform. A marginally stable dynamical state - called criticality - is thought to be beneficial for brain functions that require multiple time scales, broad dynamic range, and large information storage and transmission. A growing body of evidence suggests that criticality is a feature of healthy brain dynamics, but breaks down in certain brain disorders. Here we ask whether Parkinson's disease incurs deviation from criticality compared to healthy controls. We analyze human resting state EEG activity in primary motor cortex. Parkinson's patients exhibit prominent oscillatory brain activity in multiple frequency bands (low delta and high theta) that is not present in controls. Surprisingly, we find that these emergent oscillations are close to criticality, i.e., amplitude fluctuations with approximate temporal scale invariance. We compare traditional signatures of criticality and more principled measurements of proximity to criticality using our new approach based on temporal renormalization group theory and information theory. Our new approach and traditional methods agree, demonstrating that critical dynamics are not always healthy; Parkinson's disease is associated with the emergence of near-critical oscillations in motor cortex.",

      "title": "Show HN: Librario, a book metadata API that aggregates G Books, ISBNDB, and more",
      "content": "<p><i>TLDR:</i> Librario is a book metadata API that aggregates data from Google Books, ISBNDB, and Hardcover into a single response, solving the problem of no single source having complete book information. It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].<p>My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.<p>So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried.<p>You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself:<p><pre><code>  curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \\\n  'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq .\n  </code></pre>\nThis is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I\u2019ll or will not find out if the code handles that well.<p>The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now.<p>Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment.<p>For example:<p>- Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove subtitles into the main title field. Overly long titles (80+ chars) also get penalized since they often contain edition information or other metadata that belongs elsewhere.<p>- Covers collect all candidate URLs, then a separate fetcher downloads and scores them by dimensions and quality. The best one gets stored locally and served from the server.<p>For most other fields (publisher, language, page count), I just take the first non-empty value by priority. Simple, but it works.<p>Recently added a caching layer[2] which sped things up nicely. I considered migrating from <i>net/http</i> to <i>fiber</i> at some point[3], but decided against it. Going outside the standard library felt wrong, and the migration didn't provide much in the end.<p>The database layer is being rewritten before v1.0[4]. I'll be honest: the original schema was written by AI, and while I tried to guide it in the right direction with SQLC[5] and good documentation, database design isn't my strong suit and I couldn't confidently vouch for the code. Rather than ship something I don't fully understand, I hired the developers from SourceHut[6] to rewrite it properly.<p>I've got a 5-month-old and we're still adjusting to their schedule, so development is slow. I've mentioned this project in a few HN threads before[7], so I\u2019m pretty happy to finally have something people can try.<p>Code is AGPL and on SourceHut[8].<p>Feedback and patches[9] are very welcome :)<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b33a8ab1bc3392093c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b3...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https://sqlc.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sqlc.dev</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/</a><p>[7]: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234</a><p>[8]: <a href=\"https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a><p>[9]: <a href=\"https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRIBUTING.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRI...</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571149\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571149</a></p>\n<p>Points: 38</p>\n<p># Comments: 16</p>",

      "content": "<p>While working on a proof of concept project, I kept hitting Claude's token limit 30-60 minutes into their 5-hour sessions. The accumulating context from the codebase was eating through tokens fast. So I built a language designed to be generated by AI rather than written by humans.<p>GlyphLang<p>GlyphLang replaces verbose keywords with symbols that tokenize more efficiently:<p><pre><code>  # Python\n  @app.route('/users/')\n  def get_user(id):\n      user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n      return jsonify(user)\n\n  # GlyphLang\n  @ GET /users/:id {\n    $ user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n    > user\n  }\n\n  @ = route, $ = variable, > = return.

The AI maintains a broader view of your codebase throughout.<p>Before anyone asks: no, this isn't APL with extra steps. APL, Perl, and Forth are symbol-heavy but optimized for mathematical notation, human terseness, or machine efficiency. GlyphLang is specifically optimized for how modern LLMs tokenize. It's designed to be generated by AI and reviewed by humans, not the other way around. That said, it's still readable enough to be written or tweaked if the occasion requires.<p>It's still a work in progress, but it's a usable language with a bytecode compiler, JIT, LSP, VS Code extension, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, async/await, generics.<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://glyphlang.dev/docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://glyphlang.dev/docs</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/GlyphLang/GlyphLang\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/GlyphLang/GlyphLang</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571166\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571166</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
