      "title": "Foundation Model for Advancing Healthcare: Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions",
      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "title": "Data- and Physics-Driven Deep Learning Based Reconstruction for Fast MRI: Fundamentals and Methodologies",
      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "content": "The complexity of the mammalian brain's vast population of interconnected neurons poses a formidable challenge to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of coordination and computation. A key step forward will be technologies that can perform large-scale, cellular-resolution monitoring and interrogation of distributed brain circuit activity in behaving animals. Here, we present an all-optical strategy for precise optogenetic activity control of [~]10^3 neurons and simultaneous activity monitoring of [~]10^4 neurons within and across areas of mouse cortex--an order-of-magnitude leap beyond previous capabilities. Tracking population responses following delivery of precisely-defined widely-distributed activity patterns to the visual cortex of awake mice, we were surprised to identify neurons robustly responsive to stimulation of diverse ensembles, defying conventional like-to-like wiring rules. These cells were primarily deep L2/3 somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons with functional properties distinct from other SST neurons, and appeared to play a role in brain dynamics that could only have been identified through broad cellular-resolution circuit interrogation. Our work reveals the value of measuring large-scale circuit-dynamical properties of functionally-resolved single cells, beyond genetic and anatomical classification, to define and explore the roles of cell types in brain function.",

      "title": "Imbalanced Brain Connectome: A Novel Link between Functional Somatic Disorders, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and Post-COVID patients",
      "content": "This study aimed to investigate and assess shared patterns of structural brain connectivity across three clinical populations. Despite significant advancements in neuroimaging, structural connectivity alterations have been underexplored in functional somatic disorders (FSDs), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), and post-COVID-19 conditions (PC). Clinical observations suggest that olfactory symptoms may represent a missing link between these three patient groups. Using diffusion-weighted MRI and voxel-based probabilistic tractography, structural connectivity was analysed in 57 females (MCS: 16, FSD: 15, PC: 11, and 15 matched healthy controls). Independent-sample t-tests (with FDR correction) and permutation testing were applied to assess group-level differences, particularly in inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. A marked decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed in patients (70.9%) compared with controls (29.1%; p < 0.001). The finding was consistent across all diagnostic groups. These alterations remained stable following reanalysis and aggregation, reliably distinguishing patients from controls. No significant differences were found in intra-hemispheric connectivity across the patient groups. Additionally, out of 12 predefined interregional connections, ten showed significant alterations in at least one patient group. The findings reveal robust and consistent reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity in patients with MCS, FSD, and PC, highlighting a potentially shared neurobiological signature among the patient groups.",

      "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",
