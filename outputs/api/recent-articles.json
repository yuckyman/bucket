      "title": "Monolingual, Non-tone Bilingual, and Tone Bilingual Infants: Language Experiences Alter Speech and Nonspeech Perception",
      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "title": "Oscillatory Correlates of Metacontrol: Beta and Theta Band Contributions to Feedback-dependent Cognitive Adaptation",
      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
      "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

      "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
      "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

      "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

      "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

It remains unresolved whether non-face expertise across heterogeneous domains converges on a shared, domain-general whole-brain architecture, or instead recruits domain-contingent neural configurations that vary with task and stimulus demands. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 task-fMRI studies spanning 11 real-world non-face expertise domains (579 participants, 210 peak-activation foci). Primary analysis revealed a robust, right-lateralized parieto-temporo-occipital circuit centered on the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and adjoining inferior parietal lobule. We propose that this circuit constitutes a domain-general neural core that integrates fine-grained visual features with semantic associations while supporting attention-guided recognition of visually similar objects in expert performance. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses uncovered a complementary adaptive component, the engagement of which varied systematically with representational and contextual factors. Pictorial stimuli and expert-novice contrasts reliably strengthened recruitment of the right-hemisphere core, whereas symbolic stimuli engagement toward left temporal regions while selectively re-engaging right-core nodes. In addition, male-skewed samples showed attenuated left-hemisphere activation. Together, these findings delineate a stable right-hemisphere neural scaffold underlying non-face visual expertise, flexibly supplemented by left-hemisphere systems as a function of stimulus format, task demands, and demographic context, providing a whole-brain reference framework for future studies.",

      "content": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive mild head impacts, but no human-based experimental system exists to study injury-induced CTE-like pathology. Here, we establish a long-lived, human multicellular in vitro brain platform in which controlled mechanical injury induces key cellular features of CTE-like pathology. Injured cultures developed persistent tau phosphorylation, axonal degeneration, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction without widespread neuronal loss, consistent with progressive pathology rather than acute toxicity. To assess physiological relevance, we integrated transcriptomic profiles from the model with postmortem human CTE brain datasets. This analysis revealed striking convergence at the level of disease-associated modules and pathways, with endothelial cells emerging as critical contributors to CTE-like transcriptional programs. Using this human-based system, we further identified delayed mitochondrial dysfunction as a prominent and sustained feature of injury-induced pathology. Together, these findings establish the first human in vitro platform for studying injury-induced CTE-like pathology and identify neurovascular and mitochondrial regulation as central components of chronic neurodegeneration following repetitive mild brain injury.",

      "title": "The critical roaming hypothesis: arousal-driven transitions across critical lines reproduce human functional connectivity dynamics",
      "content": "Ongoing brain activity displays rich temporal variability associated with efficient cognition, with functional connectivity (FC) continually reconfiguring over time. The resulting functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) specifically show complex, fat-tailed statistics that alternate between persistent epochs and faster reconfiguration transients. While nonlinear whole-brain models tuned nearby a critical point have reproduced some aspects of FCD, they fall short of capturing its full temporal complexity. We propose that slow fluctuations in arousal offer a biologically plausible mechanism for exploring critical regimes in large-scale brain dynamics and thus enrich FCD. Using a connectome-based model of coupled cortical populations, we identified phase boundaries where system dynamics transition between regimes of faster or slower FCD. We then phenomenologically incorporated arousal changes, modeling them as stochastic fluctuations in key parameters such as cortical excitability, input gain, and noise amplitude. This non-autonomous formulation enables the system to roam dynamically across regime boundaries, flexibly tuning its distance from critical transition lines and producing intermittent transitions that mirror the stochastic evolution observed in empirical FCD. Fitting these models to human resting-state fMRI and performing model comparison, we find that arousal-driven models more accurately reproduce the distinctive quantitative features of FCD with the greatest improvements coming from the previously poorly accounted fat-tailed portions of the distributions. Together, these results suggest that arousal fluctuations - likely mediated by changes in neuromodulatory tone-- shape the brain's attractor landscape over time, expanding the repertoire of accessible functional network states and providing a mechanistic basis for the complexity of spontaneous functional dynamics.",

      "title": "The neural correlates of parallel and serial search",
      "content": "For almost half a century, target distractor similarity has been known to induce different visual search modes. When a target is highly salient, it can pop out, suggesting parallel processing of all items irrespective of set size. By contrast, high similarity among items requires item-by-item comparison with an attentional template, a characteristic of serial search. Despite this long-standing distinction, little is known about the neural correlates of search modes, as typical differences in visual displays confound interpretation. Here, we contrasted the neural correlates of serial and parallel search under visually identical displays. Across distinct blocks, we biased 24 participants (21 female) toward parallel or serial search by varying target distractor similarity, thereby directing attentional focus toward a single feature or conjunction. Embedded among inducer trials, test trials were visually identical across all blocks and afforded both parallel and serial search. Behavioral analyses confirmed successful induction of distinct search modes during test trials. EEG decoding reliably discriminated search modes and these neural patterns generalized across inducer and test trials. Attentional deployment toward the target differed across search modes, revealing topographical differences in target location representations. The strength of target-location representations correlated with response times, indicating that during parallel test trials, participants switched search strategies when the target was not detected early. Moreover, target representations diverged between search modes: a temporally stable pattern emerged during serial search, suggesting reliance on working memory, whereas parallel search was characterized by more dynamic representations, likely reflecting prioritization of the relevant feature. These findings demonstrate that search history shapes search mode, giving rise to clearly distinct neural dynamics even under visually identical stimulation.",

      "title": "Slow Spindle Trains During Daytime Naps are Associated with Improved Declarative Memory Consolidation",
      "content": "Memory consolidation refers to the process by which newly encoded memories are strengthened and retained over time, and ample evidence indicates that sleep supports this process for both procedural and declarative memories. Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2. These findings suggest the temporal organization of slow spindles into clusters support declarative memory consolidation, pointing to a shared spindle-based mechanism across domains.

      "content": "Visualizing active neurons and circuits in vivo is critical for investigating the neural activity that underlies behavior. While several established methodologies are available to achieve this end in larval zebrafish, they are limited by the scale of tissue visualization, temporal resolution, need to restrain larvae, and/or accessibility of necessary instruments. Here, we establish a pipeline for the visualization and quantification of spatiotemporally precise whole-brain neural activity in larval zebrafish using CaMPARI2, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain \"snapshots\" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning. This approach effectively complements the temporal precision achievable through post hoc activity detection methods and expands the accessibility of large-scale behavioral circuit dissection beyond highly specialized real-time volumetric imaging equipment.",

      "title": "Transcriptional Changes Fade Prior to Long-Term Memory for Sensitization of the Aplysia Siphon-Withdrawal Reflex",
      "content": "Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription. What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten? And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory? To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting. Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression. We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",
