      "title": "The effect of development on cortical auditory evoked potentials in normal hearing listeners and cochlear implant users",
      "content": "IntroductionCortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs), such as the P1-N1-P2 complex (onset response) and the acoustic change complex (ACC), provide insight into sound detection and discrimination. While their developmental trajectories are well documented in normal-hearing (NH) listeners, less is known about how these responses develop in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) users and how they are affected by background noise.MethodsCAEPs were recorded in quiet and +10 dB SNR noise conditions using long-duration vowel stimuli from 91 children and 11 adults with NH and 59 CI users (48 pre-lingually deafened children/young adults and 11 post-lingually deafened adults). Peak latencies (P1, N1, P2) and N1-P2 amplitudes were measured. Developmental effects were analyzed using linear regression, t-tests, and correlation analyses comparing child and adult waveforms.ResultsBoth onset and ACC responses were present across groups, with P1 latency decreasing significantly with age in NH and CI listeners. The ACC followed a similar developmental trajectory as the onset response but matured later, emerging reliably in adolescence. Noise delayed maturation, lengthened latencies, and reduced amplitudes, particularly for the ACC. CI users implanted before 3.5 years showed developmental patterns comparable to NH peers, though both onset and ACC responses were more affected by noise in CI users.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that early implantation supports the typical development of cortical auditory responses, underscoring the importance of neuroplasticity in pediatric CI users. However, the pronounced vulnerability of the ACC to noise highlights ongoing challenges in sound discrimination for CI users. CAEPs, especially ACC measures, may serve as objective markers of auditory maturation and could complement behavioral assessments in clinical practice.",

      "content": "Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that generates artifacts in simultaneous EEG recordings, hindering brain activity analysis. This study analyzes Machine Learning (ML) methods for tES noise artifact removal across three stimulation types: tDCS, tACS, and tRNS. Synthetic datasets were created by combining clean EEG data with synthetic tES artifacts. Eleven artifact removal techniques were tested and evaluated using the Root Relative Mean Squared...",

      "content": "Brain development from childhood through adolescence is crucial for understanding autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet how functional networks regulate developmental changes in brain morphology remains unclear. Here, we analyzed gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in 301 individuals with ASD and 375 typically developing controls (TDCs), aged 8-18 years, from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Using a sliding-window approach, participants were stratified by age,...",

Although it is a frequent disorder, with a reported lifetime prevalence of 35.2% in the general population, its pathophysiological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Notably, PSH frequently coexists with other primary headache disorders, particularly migraine, suggesting a possible shared biology.",
