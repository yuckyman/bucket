      "title": "Electroencephalography signatures of motor error and stimulus-driven attention in electrical muscle stimulation-induced wrist movements under motor imagery",
      "content": "This study examines how electroencephalography (EEG) signatures are modulated during passive movements induced by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Specifically, we focused on three key factors: (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions (motor imagery and waiting). We tested how error-related neural responses are modulated by the mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs during motor imagery. To this end, we introduced a wrist-movement paradigm combining motor imagery with EMS. Participants either imagined wrist dorsiflexion toward visual targets or passively waited. EMS was then applied to induce passive wrist movements. EMS intensity and presentation rate were manipulated so that the magnitude of stepwise motor error (physical deviation from the target) and stimulation-driven attention varied inversely, allowing us to evaluate their respective neural effects. Event-related potential (ERP) components at approximately 700 ms reflected graded evaluation of motor error. An ERP component at approximately 300 ms was modulated primarily by EMS intensity and presentation rate, consistent with stimulus-driven attention. Mu-band suppression reflected the match between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Theta-band enhancement in the absence of motor imagery suggested increased sensory unpredictability due to the lack of internally generated predictions, whereas beta-band activity may have been related to fluctuations in state prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed motor imagery with the EMS wrist-movement paradigm is the first to investigate how (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions shape EEG signatures during passive, electrically induced movements. Understanding how these neural signals vary with mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of error processing and sensory prediction in the human brain.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For example, Java and C# are full of enterprise coding styles, OOP and design patterns. For me, it's a nightmare to navigate and write code that way at my workplace. But whenever I read Python code or I read online lessons about it, the code is more often than not less abstracted, more explicit and there's overall less ceremony. No interfaces, no dependency injection, no events... mostly procedural, data-oriented and lightly OOP code. </p> <p>I was wondering, is this some real observation or it's just my lack of experience with Python?

      "title": "Novel devaluation methods to explore habits in humans",
      "content": "Habits in humans are commonly studied through outcome devaluation paradigms, but most existing tasks fail to capture the robustness of habitual behavior seen in animal models. I introduce two novel behavioral tasks designed to overcome these limitations. In the first task, (\"shooting aliens task\", n = 45), I simplified an existing instrumental learning task and implemented a novel intra-block reversal method in which stimulus positions changed unexpectedly within blocks while maintaining the same stimulus-action mappings. Participants also completed a classical devaluation phase with explicit reward changes. In the second task (\"hands-attack task\", n = 44), which relied on real-life avoidance behavior, devaluation was achieved by reversing reward contingencies and allowing participants to inhibit the dominant avoidance response in favor of a more effortful counterattack. Across both tasks, overtrained conditions led to more errors and longer response times after devaluation, confirming increased insensitivity to outcome change. Intra-block reversals in the shooting aliens task produced stronger habitual signatures than standard whole-block devaluation, revealing a greater cost of overriding automatic responses. In the hands-attack task, even without prior training, participants showed clear markers of habitual behavior, suggesting that real-world action patterns can replicate key features of laboratory habits. Interestingly, participants were more accurate in overriding overtrained responses when attacks were highly familiar, possibly due to enhanced perceptual processing, although this came at the cost of longer response times. These findings introduce two complementary tools that address key limitations in current paradigms: the intra-block reversal increases habit sensitivity without inflating working memory demands, while the hands-attack task captures naturalistic habit expression without artificial training, using a single, ecologically valid session. Both are suited for clinical applications, particularly where time constraints or cognitive load limit the feasibility of traditional approaches.",

      "title": "Wing mechanosensory modulation of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons in butterflies",
      "content": "Visual motion processing in flying insects is strongly modulated by behavioural state, yet the mechanisms by which mechanosensory feedback contributes to this modulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that wing mechanosensation alone is sufficient to modulate a subset of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons (WFDNs) in butterflies. Airflow stimulation of the wings, mimicking flight conditions, increased baseline firing rates and reduced response latencies in WFDNs, without altering response gain or temporal frequency tuning. These effects indicate that mechanosensory modulation acts through mechanisms distinct from those governing other state-dependent changes in visual processing. Consistent with this interpretation, previous work has shown that baseline firing and response latency can be rapidly modulated, whereas gain changes arise through slower neuromodulatory pathways. Mechanosensory modulation was cell-type specific: the horizontally tuned WFDNL neuron was consistently affected across individuals, whereas other WFDN types were largely insensitive, likely reflecting the unilateral airflow stimuli used here. Interestingly, WFDNL modulation arose exclusively from mechanosensory input from the proximal area of the wing, not from distal wing deformation. This suggests that descending visual pathways require only coarse gain or excitability modulation rather than detailed information about wing shape or strain, leaving fast reflexive control of distal wing deformation to local ganglionic circuits. Together, our results demonstrate that wing mechanosensation selectively modulates visual descending pathways by altering excitability and timing rather than visual feature encoding, supporting the existence of multiple, parallel mechanisms for state-dependent visual modulation during flight.",
