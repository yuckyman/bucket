      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources.

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "content": "Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) into amyloid fibrils underlies the pathology of synucleinopathies. Rare familial mutations can modulate a-Syn aggregation and may give rise to distinct fibril conformations linked to disease heterogeneity. The E83Q mutation, identified in a Dementia with Lewy Body disease (DLB) patient with atypical Lewy body distribution, has been shown to accelerate a-Syn aggregation and enhance neuronal seeding, yet its structural basis remains unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure at 3.4 Angstrom resolution of recombinant full-length human a-Syn fibrils harboring the E83Q mutation. The fibrils adopt a double-protofilament architecture with a conserved Greek-key-like core spanning residues 36-99, stabilized by intra- and inter-filament salt bridges. Despite this conserved fold, the E83Q mutation induces a distinct local rearrangement within the hydrophobic region: substitution of Glu83 with Gln reorients residue 83 inward, abolishing solvent exposure and altering interactions with the N-terminal region. This structural shift brings the hydrophobic region closer to the N-terminus, shielding residues implicated in post-translational modification and ligand binding. Our findings reveal how a single charge-neutralizing mutation reshapes a-Syn fibril architecture, providing a structural framework to understand the enhanced aggregation and pathogenic properties associated with the E83Q variant.",

      "title": "Deep learning to overcome human error and bias in electrode position extraction in tDCS-fMRI studies",
      "content": "Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with fMRI enables investigation of stimulation effects, while structural MRI verifies electrode positioning, critical for focal montages where minor misplacements reduce target current dose. Currently, no fully automated methods exist for precise electrode extraction from MRI. We developed an Attention U-Net-based deep learning approach to automate electrode detection in focal tDCS-fMRI studies, using structural pointwise-encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) MRI scans from a multicenter trial (N = 392 images; 1,568 electrodes, https://www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Performance was compared to manual and semi-automated methods for a 3x1 montage (three cathodes around a central anode). The network achieved robust segmentation (Dice Score = 0.76, Hausdorff distance = 36.76 mm), identifying all electrodes in 95% of cases (323/340). These metrics compared network-segmented electrodes to highly accurate, manually segmented electrodes, which are also called \"ground truth\". Linear mixed-effects models on 52 ground truth images showed deep learning outperformed manual and semi-automated methods, aligning best with ground truth. Fully/semi-automated methods comparison of 290 images showed highest agreement (ICC = 0.990, bias = 1.3 mm), while manual extraction exhibited larger biases (-5.77 to -7.06 mm) and systematic errors. The automated approach overcomes manual limitations by improving precision, eliminating human variability and bias, and enabling scalability for large studies. It sets a new standard for electrode verification in focal tDCS, particularly for studies requiring precise localization. The model is open-source, with future refinements discussed",

      "content": "Synaptic architecture underlies neuronal computation, with autophagy serving as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, function and local metabolism. Yet, autophagy dynamics and regulation within intact neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a pH sensitive fluorescence lifetime-based imaging method which allows to monitor autophagy dynamics at the synaptic level with a second-scale temporal resolution in the living mouse brain. This approach allowed us to uncover compartmentalized autophagic activity across soma, dendrites, and axons of layer 2/3 cortical neurons. Notably, we observe experience-dependent modulation of autophagy dynamics with pronounced mobility of autophagic vesicles in apical distal dendrites compared to basal proximal dendritic branches. We identified cell-type specific basal autophagy levels in excitatory, inhibitory, and astrocytic cells in the mouse cortex. Finally, combining this approach with disease associated genetic perturbation uncovers novel in vivo autophagy related phenotypes. Altogether, this approach highlights the spatial and functional complexity of autophagy in the intact mammalian brain and establishes a framework for investigating its role in synaptic regulation during development, plasticity, and aging.",

      "title": "\"Remote and partial clocks expand the circadian neuronal network, driving widespread molecular rhythmicity in Drosophila\"",
      "content": "Circadian clocks orchestrate daily physiology and behavioral rhythms, yet the extent to which cells lacking canonical clock components exhibit robust temporal regulation remains unclear. Here we addressed this question using a two-step strategy. First, we systematically mapped core clock gene expression at single-cell resolution across the Drosophila brain and body. Second, leveraging these data and performing targeted experiments, we uncovered cells that lack most or all canonical clock components yet display strong mRNA rhythms. We found that lamina wide-field neurons show high-amplitude tim mRNA cycling even in constant darkness conditions (DD) despite minimal expression of other clock genes, suggesting a partial or noncanonical oscillator. In addition, C2 and C3 optic lobe neurons, which do not express core clock components, exhibit hundreds of circadian and daily cycling transcripts. Notably, circadian rhythms in C3 neurons coincide with oscillations of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), whereas C2 neurons cycle independently of ARGs, indicating distinct non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. These findings reveal a spectrum of circadian regulation, from autonomous to remote, input-driven rhythms and expand the circadian landscape to include strategies for generating and distributing temporal information across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.",

      "title": "Cortex-wide circuits for multisensory evidence accumulation and choice formation",
      "content": "Accurate decisions in natural environments require integrating sensory information across modalities. To determine where and when multisensory signals are integrated within the cortical hierarchy, we trained mice in a visuotactile evidence-accumulation task and used widefield and two-photon calcium imaging together with optogenetic perturbations to map cortical circuits. Mice showed enhanced performance in multisensory trials that matched an additive combination of the total unisensory evidence. Cortical imaging also revealed superadditive multisensory responses in parietal and frontal regions, but visual and tactile evidence was accumulated in distinct regions, with the rostrolateral visual area (RL) being more selective for visual and the frontal medial motor cortex (MM) for tactile inputs. This modality-specific segregation persisted beyond stimulus presentation with convergence into a modality-independent choice emerging only late in the trial in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). Two-photon imaging confirmed that ALM neurons predominantly encoded modality-independent choices with few neurons responding to specific sensory stimuli. Optogenetic inactivation of RL and frontal cortex during the stimulus or choice period further validated their respective roles in sensory evidence accumulation and choice formation. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization in which modality-specific evidence is maintained until late in the decision process, with frontal cortex turning multisensory signals into unified choices.",

However, the pupil is also sensitive to luminance changes, making it difficult to study pupillary signals under natural conditions. Here we used pupillary hippus, a luminance-insensitive measure of high-frequency pupil dynamics while human participants planned naturalistic reaches in virtual reality. We found that hippus is significantly increased during planning compared to both rest and movement execution epoch. This finding shows pupillary dynamics change during motion planning reflecting preparatory processes. Most importantly, we demonstrate the potential of a new pupillometric method to study motion planning in natural conditions.",

      "title": "Endothelial Arf6 sustains capillary electrical signaling and cerebral blood flow through PIP2 regeneration and activation of Kir2.1 channels.",
      "content": "Brain capillaries sense neural activity and direct blood flow to active regions--a process termed neurovascular coupling that underlies activity-dependent increases in local perfusion (functional hyperemia). A key contributor to functional hyperemic responses is the capillary endothelial cell (cEC) inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1) channel, which is activated by neuronal activity-derived extracellular K+ and initiates vasodilatory electrical signals that propagate through the vascular network. Kir2.1 channel function requires continual production of its lipid cofactor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and is compromised in mouse models of cerebral small vessel (cSVD). Although decreased PIP2 availability is a common feature of cSVD, mechanisms underlying PIP2 synthesis remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that Arf6, a small GTPase expressed in cECs that stimulates PIP2 production, is critical for this process. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that inhibiting Arf6 activity progressively decreased cEC Kir2.1 channel activity. This deficit corresponded to loss of capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling in isolated vessels and diminished functional hyperemia in vivo. Exogenously provided PIP2 restored Kir2.1 currents and functional hyperemia after Arf6 inhibition or genetic knockdown. Collectively, our data indicate that cEC Arf6 sustains Kir2.1 activity by maintaining PIP2 levels and demonstrate that diminished PIP2 synthesis is sufficient to impair functional hyperemia. Furthermore, we identify Arf6 as a mechanistic link between PIP2 production and endothelial electrical signaling, highlighting Arf6 as a potential therapeutic target for restoring functional hyperemia.",

      "title": "Central T3 deprivation disturbs cortical cilia formation, oligodendrocyte lineage and neuronal cell-cell-communication in a MCT8/OATP1C1 deficient Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome mouse model",
      "content": "Background: The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare, X-linked human genetic disorder caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), essential for thyroid hormone (TH) transport across the blood-brain-barrier. The resulting central TH deprivation disrupts brain maturation and function, leading to intellectual disability and movement disorders. Cortical development, highly dependent on TH, is particularly affected and contributes significantly to AHDS pathologies. Methods: To elucidate disrupted cortical processes, we conducted single nucleus RNA sequencing in a mouse model engineered to mimic the central TH deficiency characteristic of human AHDS. This murine AHDS model features the concomitant deletion of both MCT8 and OATP1C1, a T4 transporter largely absent in human brain capillaries that in mice plays a role in TH transport. The phenotype of dKO mice bears striking resemblance to the pathologies observed in human AHDS patients. Results: Single nuclei were isolated from the cortex and attached striatum of 21-day old WT and MCT8/OATP1C1 dKO mice and sequenced using the 10x Genomics workflow. Cell proportion analyses on the resulting 48 clusters suggested elevated numbers of GABAergic striatal D1 and D2 neurons in the dKO mice. Diminished levels of mature oligodendrocytes coincided with a bifurcation within the oligodendrocyte lineage trajectory, leading to distinct subpopulations of WT and dKO oligodendrocytes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) patterns align poorly with Slc16a2 and Slco1c1 mRNA levels in the respective clusters, but closely with prior published cortical bulk RNAseq data of mice with systemic hypothyroidism or MCT8/OATP1C1 deficiency. These parallels confirm the reliability of our data and provide new insights by pinpointing TH-responsive DEGs to specific cellular clusters. Moreover, inferred cell-cell communication using NeuronChat suggested a disbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic signaling. We further uncovered perturbed primary cilia formation in several GABAergic and glutamatergic clusters of the dKO cortex. Discussion: Molecular signatures and perturbations uncovered by our snRNAseq study reveal new molecular characteristics of the AHDS. The imbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic cell-cell-communication, perturbed primary cilia formation, and bifurcation of the oligodendrocyte lineage align with pathologies observed in AHDS patients and highlight the role of TH signaling in maintaining neuronal network homeostasis in the cortex.",

      "title": "Temporal boundary gating of auditory sensitivity",
      "content": "Perception unfolds over time, but whether continuous sounds are sampled with uniform sensitivity is unknown. We combine human psychophysics, EEG and rodent neurophysiology to show that local auditory change detection is strongly gated by stimulus boundaries. In humans, brief perturbations inserted at different temporal positions within 0.5-1-s tones revealed an inverted U-shaped sensitivity profile: detection was attenuated near sound onset and offset and maximal mid-epoch, with EEG change responses showing a closely matching dependence on change timing. Electrocorticography in awake rats exhibited homologous temporal weighting, and analogous profiles for amplitude changes and visual motion demonstrated cross-feature and cross-modal generality. To uncover circuit mechanisms, we recorded single units along the inferior colliculus-medial geniculate body-auditory cortex pathway together with laminar local field potentials in A1. Onset-locked suppression of change responses emerged in midbrain and was progressively amplified in thalamus and cortex, whereas the full start-end profile was expressed in granular-layer alpha-gamma power. A simple biophysically grounded model in which onset responses saturate and cortical populations integrate over finite temporal windows recapitulates this pattern, explaining how stimulus boundaries disrupt prospective and retrospective integration and thereby degrade change detection near the beginning and end of sounds.",

      "content": "Mesoscopic functional brain mapping is essential to better understanding of various brain functions and dysfunctions. However, accessing distributed neural circuits in mammalian brain regions remains a significant challenge. While fiber photometry is a versatile optical approach, existing methods often suffer from invasiveness and scalability. Here we present an affordable multi-fiber array (MFA)-based photometry system to monitor neural signals across multiple regions. Our system comprises a custom-designed MFA utilizing 50-m diameter optical fibers and off-the-shelf optical components. To demonstrate the system's versatility, we monitored GABAergic population activity using jGCaMP8s across multiple brain regions in head-fixed, awake mice. By combining with pupillometry, we identified state-dependent, region-specific GABAergic dynamics. Our MFA-based photometry system opens new avenues for investigating state-dependent neural dynamics at the mesoscopic level. To facilitate wider adoption, all codes and resources are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/Sakata-Lab/MFA).",

      "title": "Introducing a translationally relevant mouse model of radiosurgery-induced unilateral hearing loss",
      "content": "Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely used to treat vestibular schwannomas but may cause irreversible hearing loss due to cochlear toxicity. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and no effective otoprotective therapies exist. We aimed to establish a mouse model that replicates the clinical pattern of radiation-induced hearing loss. Methods: C57BL/6J mice (n=31) received 8Gy (n=3), 16Gy (n=5), 24Gy (n=8), or 32Gy (n=15) using the Leksell Gamma Knife ICON system. Targeting was based on the built-in cone-beam CT, co-registered with MRI and CT-based mouse atlases, to guide unilateral cochlea targeting. A single isocenter was placed lateral to the right cochlea, with the 80% isodose line traversing its medial edge. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks post-SRS. A 32Gy subgroup (n=7) was evaluated at 16 weeks. Histological analysis of cochleae was performed at 4 weeks in all groups and at 16 weeks in the long-term 32Gy group. Results: SRS was well tolerated, and the contralateral cochlea received a very low radiation dose. No ABR shifts were observed at 8 or 16Gy, with only minimal histological changes. At 32Gy, ABR threshold shifts at 22.6 and 32kHz were evident by week1 and worsened by week4. Similar but milder effects occurred at 24Gy. In the 32Gy long-term subgroup, hearing loss progressed across all frequencies, most severely at high frequencies, alongside a sustained wave I amplitude decline. At 32 Gy, outer hair cells were reduced by 14% and 44% at 32 and 45.2 kHz, respectively, at 4 weeks, and by 38% and 80% at 16 weeks. Ribbon synapses were mildly reduced at 4 weeks and more markedly at 16 weeks in corresponding high-frequency regions. Spiral ganglion neuron density was mildly reduced at the basal and middle turns. All reported changes were statistically significant when compared to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: This new model reproduces key features of SRS-induced cochlear toxicity, including unilateral, dose-dependent, and progressive hearing loss. It thus provides a valuable platform for investigating mechanisms and testing otoprotective strategies.",
