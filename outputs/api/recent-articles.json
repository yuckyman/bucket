      "title": "Dendritic delay lines shape the computation of sound location in neurons of the gerbil medial superior olive",
      "content": "In mammals, neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) encode information about sounds arising from discrete spatial locations along the horizon. This tuning requires that an internal delay in the brain must offset acoustic disparities to ensure coincident arrival of excitatory inputs driven from the two ears. The source of this internal delay, originally assumed to arise from axonal delay lines, is currently controversial in mammals. Here we use 2-photon guided paired dendritic and somatic recordings together with compartmental modeling of 40 complete MSO neuron morphologies to demonstrate that the dendrites themselves serve as a significant source of internal delay. We show that most MSO neurons exhibit morphological asymmetries that impose different EPSP delays across dendrites and shifts in optimal interaural time differences. Dendrite-based delays in the mammalian MSO are heterogeneous within each isofrequency laminae and provide a stable, structural mechanism to help tune individual neurons to sounds from different azimuthal locations.",

      "title": "mPFC Synaptosome Proteomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Muscarinic Receptor Changes in a Learned Helplessness Mouse Model",
      "content": "Stressful events are a leading factor in development of depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with depression etiology and exposure to uncontrollable stressors results in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Learned helplessness is a behavioral paradigm that measures effects of repeated exposure to uncontrollable, inescapable stress on later responses to escapable stress. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of mPFC synaptosomes in a mouse learned helplessness model to identify molecular changes that could contribute to functional consequences of inescapable stress. Male and female mice were evaluated at baseline and following exposure to escapable or inescapable stress followed by an active avoidance test. Label-free mass spectrometry followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses identified alterations in signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and protein shuttling. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics revealed alterations related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter signaling and protein internalization, as well as changes in activity of kinases previously identified as mediators of antidepressant efficacy (GSK3B) and receptor internalization (ADRBK1). We more deeply examined alterations in the Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling Pathway, and identified muscarinic receptor proteins (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm4) and key proteins involved in their translocation to and from the membrane. These results identify substantial changes in the mPFC proteome following exposure to inescapable stressors. In addition, mPFC muscarinic cholinergic signaling is well placed to mediate responses to an inescapable stressor. This proteomic study will be useful in guiding studies of human mPFC relevant to depression. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073765.",

      "title": "Intrinsic Circadian Organization of the Spinal Cord and Dorsal Root Ganglia",
      "content": "Circadian rhythms coordinate daily fluctuations in physiology and behavior, yet their organization within primary sensory pathways remains poorly defined. Although somatosensory responsiveness varies across the day night cycle, it is unclear whether peripheral sensory circuits possess molecular mechanisms for temporal regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the spinal peripheral sensory axis harbors robust, tissue autonomous circadian clocks. Using real time bioluminescence imaging, we observed sustained oscillations of the core clock protein PER2 in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), indicating autonomous circadian timing within these tissues. To define the molecular scope of this regulation, we performed RNA sequencing across a 52 hours circadian time course in DRGs. Circadian analysis identified 626 rhythmic transcripts, representing 3.6% of expressed genes. These genes exhibited non uniform phase distributions and segregated into discrete temporal clusters. Functional annotation revealed phase specific enrichment of biological processes related to transport, neuronal structure, and proteostasis, suggesting coordinated temporal deployment of distinct molecular programs rather than uniform oscillations across the circadian cycle. Cross referencing circadian genes with neuropathic pain associated gene sets revealed limited overlap; however, overlapping genes aligned to specific baseline phase windows enriched for regenerative annotations. Potassium channel related signaling components implicated in neuropathic pain also showed baseline circadian modulation. Together, these findings establish the spinal dorsal horn and DRGs as intrinsically circadian tissues and reveal a temporally structured molecular landscape in primary sensory neurons, providing a framework for understanding how peripheral sensory processing, plasticity, and homeostatic regulation are coordinated across the day night cycle.",

      "title": "Associative emotional memory encoding: Insights from network stability analysis of an fMRI-driven bilinear dynamics",
      "content": "The interplay between emotion and memory is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience, with open questions about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. This article studies dynamic interactions among the hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex during an fMRI associative memory encoding task. Participants were clustered into three condition groups: Neutral Neutral, Neutral Emotional, or Emotional Emotional, and viewed image pairs associated with their assigned condition. Using the dynamic causal modeling framework, we explore several dynamic models and show that a stochastic bilinear state space model best describes the neuronal dynamics in all conditions. Furthermore, we use graph and control theory techniques to both validate and analyze the model. In particular, we analyze the network dynamics of each condition using tools from graph theory and stability theory and discuss the differences in the strength and direction of connectivity as well as the stability of each of these networks. We confirm the prior finding that memory is enhanced in emotional conditions, in particular in the Neutral Emotional condition. In our work, this enhanced memory is associated with increased hippocampus amygdala coupling and overall network connectivity. In addition, we show that in the Emotional Emotional condition, the coupling of the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the whole network connectivity increases when the first image valence is substantially less negative rated than the second image. This pattern mirrors the Neutral Emotional condition, where the first image is neutral compared with the second one. Moreover, our model based analyses suggest that the amygdala predominantly influences the other two regions in the Neutral Emotional condition, whereas the OFC plays a dominant role in the other two conditions. Combined data driven modeling, stability analyses, and graph theory tools led to new insights and enhanced the mechanistic understanding of cortical dynamics of emotional associative memory. We discuss these insights, utilize these analytical tools to generalize our findings to some unmeasured conditions, and highlight the potential of these techniques to inform the design of future regulatory mechanisms.",

      "title": "Injury-transduced SerpinOLs modulate neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS",
      "content": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction is common in CNS diseases, but the molecular and functional responses of oligodendroglia to CNS pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes (OLs) respond to demyelinating diseases by dysregulating serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N). Homeostatic OLs transition to Serpina3n-expressing OLs (SerpinOLs) under other diseased conditions including stroke, endotoxicity, neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and non-diseased healthy aging conditions. Mechanistically, CNS inflammation or inflammatory mediators is sufficient for SerpinOL transition. Instead, oligodendrocyte injury even in the absence of neuroinflammation or glial activation is sufficient for the transition. Phenotypically, SerpinOLs are characterized by molecular signatures of inflammatory and immune regulation and STAT3 signaling activation. Functionally, SerpinOLs exacerbate neuroinflammation and promote glial activation toward pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative states. Together, our findings suggest SerpinOLs are a common population of injury-transduced OLs that amplify neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS through SERPINA3N secretion. Our findings provide new insights into myelination-independent role of OLs in regulating CNS pathophysiology.",
