      "title": "Effects of Cholesterol Modulation on Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss",
      "content": "Cisplatin is a widely used and effective anticancer drug. However, it causes permanent sensorineural hearing loss in over 50% of treated patients. There are no FDA-approved therapies to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL) in adults, highlighting a critical unmet clinical need. Previous studies suggest that statins, commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are associated with reduced incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Statins are primarily used to lower cholesterol, but they also exert several pleiotropic effects, making the mechanism(s) underlying this protection unclear. Here we examine whether reduced plasma cholesterol confers protection against CIHL independent of statin treatment. We utilized mice lacking serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9 knockout (KO) mice) as a genetic model of reduced plasma cholesterol. We find that Pcsk9 KO mice are protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, as reflected by significantly lower ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts relative to wild type (WT) mice following treatment. Histological analyses confirmed preservation of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in Pcsk9 KO mice treated with cisplatin, whereas WT mice showed significant OHC loss in the high-frequency cochlear regions. Finally, hearing loss positively correlated with baseline plasma cholesterol levels. Together our data demonstrate that systemic cholesterol reduction provides significant protection against CIHL, and they suggest that the protective effect of statins against CIHL is mediated by cholesterol reduction.",

      "content": "Conjunctival melanoma is a rare, potentially lethal cancer that mainly affects fair-skinned individuals. The tumor mostly arises from primary acquired melanosis (PAM) with atypia. The presentation of conjunctival melanoma varies and should be clinically differentiated from an array of ocular surface pigmented and nonpigmented lesions. Mutations in the oncogenes BRAF (V600E) and NRAS, and the tumor suppressor gene NF1, are associated with worse survival. UV signature mutations are frequently...",

Given the rapidly aging population and the desirable cost-benefit ratio of home-delivered meals, policymakers and public health strategies may consider expanding such programs to address the increasing demand.",

There was evidence that DBS surgery may improve certain aspects of reading speed and contrast acuity and further study is needed. This work underscores the need for innovative approaches to enhance visual function in...",
