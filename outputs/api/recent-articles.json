      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "To address the issues of intense image noise interference and computational intensity faced by traditional vision-based weld tracking systems, we propose WeldLight, a lightweight and noise-resistant convolutional neural network for precise classification and positioning of welding seam feature points using single-line structured light vision. Our approach includes (1) an online data augmentation method to enhance training samples and improve noise adaptability; (2) a one-stage lightweight...",

      "content": "Radio frequency (RF)-based human activity sensing is an essential component of ubiquitous computing, with WiFi sensing providing a practical and low-cost solution for gesture and activity recognition. However, challenges such as manual data collection, multipath interference, and poor cross-domain generalization hinder real-world deployment. Existing data augmentation approaches often neglect the biomechanical structure underlying RF signals. To address these limitations, we present CM-GR, a...",

External eggshell quality-measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness-is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of...",
