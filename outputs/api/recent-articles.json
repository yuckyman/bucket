      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Injury-Induced Remodeling of Junctional Actin Bands in the Vestibular Maculae of Mice and Chicks: Implications for Sensory Regeneration",
      "content": "The vestibular organs of birds are capable of regenerating sensory hair cells after ototoxic injury, but the regenerative ability of the mammalian vestibular organs is much more limited. The factors that inhibit regeneration in the mammalian inner ear are not known, but it has been proposed that the structure of filamentous actin cables at cell-cell junctions within the sensory epithelium may be an important regulatory influence. Junctional actin cables in the chick utricle are relatively thin, while those in mouse utricle are much thicker. These differences result in differing mechanical properties of the avian vs. mammalian inner ear, which may affect the potential for regenerative proliferation. The present study characterized injury-evoked changes in junctional actin cables in the utricles of mice and chicks. We found that the thickness of junctional cables in the chick utricle was not affected by ototoxic injury, but that injury to the mouse utricle led to the formation of many new junctional actin bands whose thickness was comparable to those in the chick utricle. Thicker actin bands persisted after injury, but were not necessarily associated with cellular junctions. In addition, the relative extent of supporting cell expansion in the injured chick utricle was larger than that in the mouse utricle, which may affect activation of Hippo/YAP signaling in both species. Together, these data point to important differences in actin cable plasticity in the avian vs. mammalian utricle that may partially account for their differing regenerative abilities.",
