      "title": "Effect of dependency and tail behavior on a probability inequality occurring in modeling cognitive processes",
      "content": "A central idea in modeling performance in cognitive tasks is dynamic competition among processes in separate channels, known as \"race model\". This model implies a certain inequality between associated probability distributions under rather general conditions. The inequality represents an important empirical test of the race model, but its usefulness is limited since it requires the assumption of stochastic independence between the channels. Using the stop signal paradigm as reference, we investigate more general forms of stochastic dependence that still imply the inequality using the concepts of copula and heavy-tailed marginal distributions.",

      "title": "CB2 cannabinoid receptor-specific therapeutic antibody agonists for treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy",
      "content": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating complication of cancer treatment. CB2 cannabinoid receptor activation reduces inflammation and is an attractive therapeutic target. Antibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), like CB2, offer high specificity and peripheral-restriction, thereby minimizing off-target activity. Here, we investigated the efficacy of first-in-class CB2-specific antibody agonists (AB110 and AB120) and an isotype control (AB100) on mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel in both tumor-free and mammary (4T1) tumor-bearing female mice. These CB2 antibody agonists exhibit biased G-alfa; signaling and also reduce macrophage markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Paclitaxel produced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation, which were reduced by AB110 and AB120 for approximately 48 hours post-injection in female mice. Repeated daily dosing did not lead to tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects. Prophylactic treatment with AB110 and AB120 during paclitaxel treatment delayed, but did not prevent, the development of paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities after termination of dosing with antibody agonists. AB100 had no effect under any conditions. The anti-allodynic effects of AB120 were absent in CB2 knockout mice, confirming pharmacological specificity via CB2 receptors. Furthermore, AB120 remained effective in paclitaxel-treated tumor-bearing mice. Neither AB110 nor AB120 affected locomotor activity in otherwise naive mice. The cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel on 4T1 tumor cell line was maintained in the presence of CB2 antibody agonists in vitro. Overall, our results suggest that CB2-specific antibody agonists are promising candidates for treating CIPN, providing lasting pain relief without tolerance, off target effects or unwanted CB1-mediated motor side effects.",

      "title": "A computational model of the mammalian auditory periphery with a multichannel, energy-driven, medial olivocochlear reflex",
      "content": "The afferent auditory system, and how its specialized mechanisms and circuits support ecologically relevant auditory computations such as speech recognition, has received considerable attention in decades past. This work has culminated in accurate computational models of early afferent coding alongside a good understanding of how low-level mechanisms (e.g., peripheral tuning) impact auditory perception. In contrast, the auditory efferent system and its role in auditory perception is much less well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we describe modifications to a model of the auditory periphery to include a medial olivocochlear efferent pathway that dynamically adjusts cochlear gain in response to sound via the classical medial olivocochlear reflex loop. We show that this model can simulate the effects of contralateral elicitors on auditory-nerve responses, including the effect of elicitors that are tonotopically distant from probes. Inclusion of across-frequency efferent effects necessitated a novel multichannel design.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

      "title": "Network Adaptability Governs Resilience and Susceptibility to Social Defeat",
      "content": "Stress resilience is defined as the ability to maintain mental health after adversity. In humans, resilience is marked by threat/safety discrimination and extinction of fear, whereas susceptibility involves fear generalization and extinction resistance. Using a translational mouse model of chronic social defeat stress combined with preregistered multimodal brain imaging, we investigated structural and network level markers of resilience, susceptibility, and threat learning. Resilience was characterized by preserved dentate gyrus integrity, greater microstructural complexity in prefrontal regions, and signatures consistent with enhanced inhibitory gating within amygdalar circuits. Susceptibility, in contrast, involved reduced dentate gyrus complexity and diminished microstructural flexibility, with a weaker but parallel pattern in the basolateral amygdala. Impaired threat learning was linked to compromised CA1/CA2 integrity and reduced pons connectivity, highlighting hippocampal brainstem interactions in memory consolidation. Overall, these findings show that resilience emerges from adaptive network reorganization, whereas susceptibility and impaired learning reflect distinct dysfunctions, underscoring individual coping differences even among genetically identical animals.",
