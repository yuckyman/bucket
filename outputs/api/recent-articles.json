      "title": "Working Memory Selectively Modulates Subjective Perception: A Pilot Study",
      "content": "This study aimed to investigate how working memory interacts with perception at the behavioral level. We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception. We hereby treat this preprint as a form of pre-registration, specifying our hypotheses, experimental designs, and analysis methods before examining whether the preliminary results will be confirmed in a larger sample.",

      "content": "Synaptic pruning by glial cells is critical for refining neural circuits, yet which glial populations mediate this process in hypothalamic networks controlling energy balance remains poorly understood. Here, using 3D-ultrastructural analyses and molecular approaches, we show that tanycytes, specialized glial cells lining the third ventricle, actively engulf excitatory synapses in the mediobasal hypothalamus during a defined postnatal window. This phagocytic activity relies on tanycytic MFG-E8 and phosphatidylserine exposure on synaptic elements. Disruption of this pathway reduces synapse uptake in vitro and alters body weight control around weaning and glucose homeostasis in adulthood. These findings identify tanycytes as previously unrecognized glial mediators of synaptic pruning in hypothalamic circuits, establishing their active role in shaping neural networks underlying energy balance.",

      "title": "Traces of parenthood but not pregnancy loss in UK Biobank structural brain MRI data",
      "content": "Pregnancy induces neuroanatomical changes in the human brain. Earlier studies detected traces of motherhood decades after childbirth. It is unclear whether these reflect persisting traces of pregnancy or effects of parenthood. We investigated effects of past birth and of pregnancy loss in women, and effects of fatherhood in men, using univariate and machine learning analyses on 205 regional brain volumes. A group of mothers and an age-matched sample of nulliparous women (N=4357 per group, mean age 63 years) from the UK Biobank, with no past pregnancy losses, showed significant volumetric group differences in 14 regions at Bonferroni-adjusted =.05. Likewise, we identified 18 significant group differences between age-matched samples of fathers and non-fathers of the same size (mean age 63.4), with 9 regions overlapping between sexes. Brain-wide association statistics for past live birth in mothers and those for fatherhood correlated (r = 0.55). XGBoost machine learning models trained to classify parenthood status separately in both datasets showed performance that was low, but significantly above chance (10-fold cross validation: AUC=0.56, p<1e-5 Motherhood classifier, AUC=0.54, p<1e-5, Fatherhood classifier, 10k permutations). We tested the motherhood classification model on an independent test sample comprising of four age-matched groups: 1. women who have never been pregnant, 2. women with past pregnancy loss but no live births, 3. women with live births but no pregnancy loss, and 4. women who experienced both. Class probability was significantly associated with live births, but not past loss. These findings may suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of past childbirth partly also reflect traces of parenthood and not solely persisting traces of past pregnancy, although a more detailed characterization of pregnancy loss data would be needed for full confirmation of this interpretation. Therefore, further research is needed to quantify the extent and understand the nature of these changes, particularly considering the known vulnerability for mental disorders associated with reproductive events.",

      "title": "Inherited retinal degenerations: PARP regulates calpain activation via TRPM2 channels in rd1 mouse photoreceptors",
      "content": "Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) refers to untreatable blinding diseases characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss. Photoreceptor degeneration is often associated with an excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. To explore the interplay between PARP and calpain activity, we employed organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice and from the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Retinae were treated with the PARP inhibitors INO1001 or Olaparib, the poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor JA2131, or the transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) blocker 8-Br-ADPR. Readouts included the TUNEL assay to detect cell death, in situ activity assays for histone-deacetylases (HDAC), PARP, and calpain, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP, PARG, and TRPM2 inhibition reduced calpain activity and calpain-2 activation. PARP activity was decreased by PARP and TRPM2 inhibitors but not by PARG inhibition. Remarkably, the PARP inhibitor INO1001 increased HDAC activity unlike any of the other compounds. When combined with the PARG inhibitor JA2131, INO1001 reduced photoreceptor cell death in a synergistic fashion, although such synergy was not observed for calpain or PARP activity. Moreover, synergistic photoreceptor preservation was not observed when JA2131 was combined with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Overall, these results indicate that in rd1 photoreceptors, PARP controls calpain activity via PARG and TRPM2-induced Ca2+ influx. We also characterize INO1001 as potentially more beneficial for IRD treatment than Olaparib. Our study details the complexity of PARP-signalling in photoreceptors and identifies PARG and TRPM2 as new targets for IRD therapy development.",

      "content": "Subjective color (SC) refers to chromatic perception induced by achromatic stimuli, as classically demonstrated using Benham's top. Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham's top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors. These findings suggest that cortical predictive mechanisms may complement retinal processes in generating subjective color phenomena.",

      "content": "Previous studies using a visual texture discrimination task (TDT) have demonstrated that performance enhancements resulting from extensive daily training (full training condition) remained intact after replacing all training, except for the first and last session, with a few daily reminder trials (reminder condition). Omitting reminders (control condition) yielded only limited learning, supporting their crucial contribution. We first confirmed these findings and excluded gaze position differences among conditions as a contributing factor. Next, we tested whether the reminders effectiveness is specific to a context of limited attention to the peripheral target caused by simultaneously performing a demanding fixation task. Removing the fixation task yielded performance levels in the first session matching those normally reached after lengthy daily training, suggesting that learning in the standard TDT involves the redeployment of attention. After changing texture parameters to increase the difficulty of the task, performing the TDT without a fixation task yielded learning in all three conditions. This indicates that in a dual-task, reminders can produce learning outcomes comparable to full training. In contrast, when the TDT is performed with full attention to the target, consolidation of the initial session alone can yield improvements equivalent to those observed in reminder and full training conditions.",

Here, we present MyeliMAP (Myelination MAPping), a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived microphysiological and electrophysiological platform that enables robust modeling of CNS myelination. The system combines inducible hPSC-derived neurons and oligodendrocytes in a custom-engineered microfluidic microstructure designed to mimic the developing brain microenvironment, promoting spatially organized axon-glia interactions and controlled myelin sheath formation. Within six weeks, we demonstrate myelin formation and maturation by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural validation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming compact multilayered wrapping of human axons. Importantly, the microstructure is directly integrated with a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA), enabling real-time, long-term functional assessment of network activity and myelin-dependent changes in signal conduction. This allowed us to demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-based myelinated neurons display enhanced conduction velocity of action potentials compared to neuron monocultures. Moreover, the presence of oligodendrocytes stabilized the temporal neuronal network activity by reducing variability in firing patterns and enhancing synchrony across the culture. This dual structure-function approach surpasses static end-point analyses by coupling morphological validation with dynamic, quantitative measurements of maturing circuit physiology. MyeliMAP provides a reproducible, human-relevant platform to dissect neuron-glia interactions and accelerate discovery of remyelination-promoting strategies for CNS disease.",

      "title": "Exercise remodels hippocampal extracellular matrix to alleviate chondroitin-4-sulphate-induced memory impairment.",
      "content": "Research utilising exercise therapeutically to enhance neuroplasticity mainly reports enhanced expression of neurotrophic (neural growth) factors which are associated with increased neurogenesis, structural changes, and improved memory. However, these neural changes are tightly regulated by both promotors and inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and the effect of exercise on inhibitory pathways is currently understudied. We show that exercise also modulates inhibitors of neuroplasticity. Six weeks of treadmill training reduced the gene expression of aggrecan, a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG), and altered the composition of CSPG containing structures, perineuronal nets, in the rodent hippocampus. Genetically manipulating chondroitin-4-sulphation of CSPGs by overexpressing hippocampal Chst11 impaired memory performance, which was mitigated by treadmill training. We provide evidence that hippocampal CSPGs are involved in object recognition memory, and that there is a link between exercise, modulating hippocampal inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and memory performance.",

      "content": "Affective empathy is defined as individual percept and respond to another emotion appropriately, an essential building block for human society. Historically, aberrant empathy was considered as major characteristics of autistic individuals but recently it has been challenged. It required mechanistic understanding of the empathy process, especially how autistic individual percept other emotion. By evaluating the social fear transfer response, we reported a critical role of Shank3 gene, one of the most replicated causative autism genes, in cortico-amygdala circuit in balancing and integrating affective empathy process using preclinical mouse models. We found that Shank3 knock-out mouse exhibited unexpected exaggerated affective responses, which was encoded by defective neural dynamics of Shank3-deficient cingulate projecting amygdala circuit. This work for the first time showcased an interplay between gene and affective empathy responses in mouse and laid the groundwork for modeling emapthy in autism and other neuropsychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Rho signaling promotes cell excitability and synaptic transmission",
      "content": "Gq signaling through Trio RhoGEF and Phospholipase C effectors promotes neurotransmitter release at synapses. Whether activated Rho and Phospholipase C signaling acts through shared or independent pathways remains unclear. We use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans, which is regulated positively by Gq signaling and negatively by Go signaling, to determine the role of Rho GTPase in G-protein regulation of neural circuit excitability. We previously showed that Trio signals in both the presynaptic Hermaphrodite-Specific command Neurons (HSNs) and the postsynaptic egg-laying vulval muscles they innervate to promote egg laying. Here we show that its effector Rho similarly signals both pre- and post-synaptically. Expression of constitutively active Rho-1(G14V) in either the HSNs or vulval muscles increased their Ca2+ activity and stimulated egg laying. Conversely, reducing Rho signaling in the HSNs via expression of Rho-1(T19N) or C3 transferase expression inhibited HSN Ca2+ activity and egg laying. Animals lacking Rho function in HSN still had vulval muscle Ca2+ activity that supported contraction and egg release, although this Ca2+ activity lacked the enhancement associated with HSN neurotransmitter release, suggesting it was largely driven by stretch-dependent feedback. Together, these results show that Rho signals in both the HSNs and vulval muscles to promote excitability and egg laying.",
