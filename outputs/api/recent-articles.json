      "title": "Vicarious trauma primes innate immunity and reconfigures human brain networks",
      "content": "Vicarious trauma-witnessing serious harm to others-produces systemic neuroimmune effects in animal models. However, its brain, autonomic, and immune consequences in humans remain unclear. We scanned 88 participants with fMRI during a naturalistic movie-viewing paradigm depicting either industrial cruelty to farm animals (Vicarious Trauma, VT) or positive human-animal interactions (Vicarious Community, VC) with concurrent autonomic physiology and gene expression in circulating monocytes. VT, compared to VC, evoked sustained sympathetic arousal lasting 40 minutes post-viewing and primed innate immune cells to elicit elevated pro-inflammatory (upregulating IL1B and CXCL8) and reduced anti-inflammatory (TGFB1) responses. VT reduced integration in a frontoparietal control system and increased coupling between a salience/action-mode system with paralimbic, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor regions. Disrupted negative coupling between frontoparietal/default-mode and hippocampal systems predicted VT-related CXCL8 increases. These findings shed light on how the brain translates vicarious trauma into the priming of innate immunity.",

      "title": "Atypical somatosensory adaptation in adults on the autism spectrum: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping study.",
      "content": "Adaptation to repetitive sensory inputs promotes efficient neural processing by attenuating responses to redundant information and reallocating resources to novel stimuli. Reduced adaptation has been proposed to contribute to atypical sensory reactivity in autism, but the physiological mechanisms underlying tactile adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we examined short-term adaptation to repetitive vibrotactile stimulation in autistic and neurotypical adults using high-density electrophysiological recordings. Fifty participants (18-44 years; 25 autistic; 25 neurotypical), received sequences of four brief vibrations to the index fingertip while viewing silent videos. Neural responses were analyzed for an early negative deflection (N1, ~100 milliseconds) indexing basic stimulus recognition, and a later positive deflection (P2, ~200-300 milliseconds) indexing higher-order contextual and attentional processing. Adaptation was quantified as changes in response magnitude across the four vibrations. The N1 did not differ between groups, showing minimal change across repetitions, indicating comparable processing of basic tactile features. In contrast, the P2 was significantly larger overall in the autistic group. Across both groups, responses to the first vibration in each sequence were greater than responses to subsequent vibrations, reflecting re-sensitization following the inter-sequence interval. Autistic participants exhibited consistently amplified P2 responses to initial vibrations, suggesting heightened re-sensitization rather than impaired within-sequence adaptation. Associations between neural responses and clinical measures of autistic traits and tactile sensitivity were modest. These findings indicate that autistic adults show amplified higher-order neural responses to tactile input alongside preserved short-term adaptation. Heightened re-sensitization to repeated touch may reflect shortened refractory periods, contributing to sensory hyper-reactivity and increased perceptual load.",

      "title": "Cortical Thickness and Curvature in Autism and ADHD: A Mega-Analysis",
      "content": "Background: Existing evidence suggests cortical morphometric alterations occur in people with autism and ADHD. However, these findings remain tentative due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous imaging pipelines, varied statistical approaches, and limited harmonization across acquisition sites. Few studies have applied standardized processing to large, clinically enriched datasets or addressed site-related batch effects. Methods: We leveraged six large-scale brain imaging datasets (n = 9,647; male=5,835; female=3,812; ages 5-64 years), including 1,533 individuals with ADHD, 1,080 with autism spectrum disorder, and 7,034 matched controls. All imaging data were processed using the validated ABCD-HCP pipeline, with cortical parcellation into 360 regions based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, and ComBat harmonization was applied to account for variability across 67 acquisition sites. Group-level differences in cortical thickness and sulcal curvature were examined with ANCOVAs, controlling for covariates and using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analyses revealed distinct neuroanatomical signatures for both autism and ADHD. Individuals with autism exhibited regionally thinner cortex and curvature alterations particularly in the Cingulo-Opercular network. In contrast, individuals with ADHD displayed regionally thicker cortex, particularly in the default mode and somatomotor networks, alongside curvature differences. Control participants showed intermediate patterns, suggesting that autism and ADHD may represent diverging extremes of cortical maturation. Conclusions: Cortical thickness and curvature emerge as potential biomarkers that can advance understanding of neurodevelopmental conditions and disentangle heterogeneity across diagnostic groups. These findings highlight the value of harmonized, large-scale, standardized analyses for resolving inconsistencies in the literature.",

      "content": "Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide and is associated with substantial pain and mental health burden, yet its neurobiological correlates remain poorly characterized. Neuroimaging studies of endometriosis are particularly limited. Here we present a comprehensive, multidimensional investigation of the neurobiology of endometriosis, integrating structural and diffusion neuroimaging, biofluid measures, neuropsychological testing, and detailed health and psychosocial phenotyping in individuals with and without endometriosis. Compared with controls, individuals with endometriosis exhibited higher levels of pain, depression, and anxiety and performed worse across multiple cognitive domains. Global and regional brain morphometric measures did not differ between groups; however, endometriosis-specific pain was associated with altered gray matter volume and white matter microstructure across distributed pain-related neural circuits. These findings identify pain-related neurobiological signatures of endometriosis and establish a foundation for mechanistic and translational studies of its central nervous system effects.",
