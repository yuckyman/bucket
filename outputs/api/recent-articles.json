      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Ventral Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons Regulate Decision-Making or Motor Impulsivity Differentially across Learning and Biological Sex",
      "content": "<p>Dopaminergic transmission within the ventral striatum is broadly implicated in risk/reward decision-making and impulse control, and the rat gambling task (rGT) measures both behaviors concurrently. While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviors uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the relative importance of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary as learning progresses; the former should dominate while rats learn the probabilistic contingencies of the task, whereas suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is established and exploited. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically influence reinforcement learning by modulating dopamine (DA) release and gating periods of DA-facilitated neuroplasticity. We therefore hypothesized that ventral striatal CINs (vsCINs) could influence reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or stable performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics in Sprague Dawley rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), we found support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of vsCINs once behavior was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting vsCINs during task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity but instead decreased and increased risky choice, respectively. Notably, the former effect was only observed in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing testable predictions regarding acetylcholine&ndash;DA interactions that may explain sex differences.</p>",

      "title": "Orofacial Movements: Individuality and Stereotypy When Mice Move a Single Whisker to Touch",
      "content": "<p>A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch behavior are unknown. Here we trained five head-fixed male and 11 female mice in a go-cue task to move a whisker to touch a sensor. Our analysis of orofacial movements shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e., whether go-cue triggered movement had begun or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude, and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task&mdash;to touch the sensor within 2&nbsp;s&mdash;how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.</p>",

      "content": "<p>How is spatial attention deployed in mental images? Mental imagery is often assumed to share mechanisms with visual perception and visual working memory. Top-down, endogenous spatial attention in both visual perception and working memory modulates behavior and parieto-occipital alpha-band activity. However, working memory captures only a subset of mental imagery, which can also draw upon long-term memory. Here, we ask whether and how spatial attention operates in mental images derived from general knowledge in long-term memory and whether it recruits the same neural mechanisms as visual perception. We recorded EEG in 28 healthy volunteers (13 males, 15 females) as they performed two discrimination tasks with spatial cues (70% valid): one involving the mental visualization of a long-term memory map (a map of France) and the other using visual stimuli. We show that spatial attention shortens response times in both tasks, but through distinct mechanisms. Behavioral attentional benefits were uncorrelated across tasks, and spatial attention in mental imagery engaged distinct neural mechanisms, with frontal rather than posterior alpha activity modulation. We further reveal fundamental differences in the spatial structures of mental imagery and visual perception. Altogether, our results show that mental images drawn from long-term semantic memory are spatially organized and are amenable to spatial attention deployment, but the underlying neural mechanisms differ from those of visual perception. Our results thus point to marked differences between mental imagery from long-term memory and visual perception.</p>",

      "title": "Attentional Engagement with Target and Distractor Streams Predicts Speech Comprehension in Multitalker Environments",
      "content": "<p>Understanding speech while ignoring competing speech streams in the surrounding environment is challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that attention shapes the neural representation of speech features. Attended streams are typically represented more strongly than unattended ones, suggesting either enhancement of the attended or suppression of the unattended stream. However, it is unclear how these complementary processes support attentional filtering and speech comprehension on different hierarchical levels. In this study, we used multivariate temporal response functions to analyze the EEG signals of 43 young adults (24 women), examining the relationship between the neural tracking of acoustic and higher-level linguistic features and a fine-grained speech comprehension measure. We show that the neural tracking of word and phoneme onsets and word level linguistic features in the attended stream predicted comprehension at the individual single-trial level. Moreover, acoustic tracking of the ignored speech stream was positively correlated with comprehension performance, whereas word level linguistic neural tracking of the ignored stream was negatively correlated with comprehension. Collectively, our results suggest that attentional filtering during speech comprehension requires target enhancement as well as distractor suppression at different hierarchical levels.</p>",

      "title": "Repeated Morphine Exposure Reversibly Impairs Spike Generation and Repetitive Firing in a Functionally Distinct Subpopulation of Orexin Neurons",
      "content": "<p>Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides regulate numerous essential functions including sleep/wake state stability and reward processing. Orexin synthesizing neurons respond to drug cues and undergo structural changes following persistent drug exposure. Postmortem brains from opioid users and opioid-treated rodents have orexin somata that become ~20% smaller and ~50% more numerous and are postulated to promote hypermotivation for drug seeking though increased orexin release. Biophysical considerations suggest that the decreased soma size should increase cellular excitability; however, the impact of chronic opioids on firing ability, which drives peptide release, has not been explored. To test this, we assessed the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons by whole-cell recordings in slices from male orexin-EGFP mice treated for 2&nbsp;weeks by daily morphine or saline injections. Paradoxically, we found that while daily morphine decreased the average soma size, it impaired excitability in a subpopulation of orexin neurons identified by electrophysiological criteria as \"H-type\" while entirely sparing \"D-type\" neurons. This impairment was manifest by smaller, broader action potentials, variable firing, and a downscaling of firing gain. These adaptations required more than a single morphine dose and recovered, along with soma size, after 4&nbsp;weeks of passive withdrawal. Taken together, these observations indicate that daily opioid exposure differentially impacts H-type orexin neurons and predicts that the ability of these neurons to encode synaptic inputs into spike trains and to release neuropeptides becomes impaired in conjunction with opioid dependence.</p>",

      "title": "Contents of Visual Predictions Oscillate at Alpha Frequencies",
      "content": "<p>Predictions of future events have a major impact on how we process sensory signals. However, it remains unclear how the brain keeps predictions online in anticipation of future inputs. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate decoding techniques to investigate the content of perceptual predictions and their frequency characteristics. Thirty-two participants (23 female) were engaged in a shape discrimination task, while auditory cues predicted which specific shape would likely appear. Frequency analysis revealed significant oscillatory fluctuations of predicted shape representations in the pre-stimulus window in the alpha band (10&ndash;11&nbsp;Hz). Furthermore, we found that this stimulus-specific alpha power was linked to expectation effects on shape discrimination behavior. Our findings demonstrate that sensory predictions are embedded in pre-stimulus alpha oscillations and modulate subsequent perceptual performance, providing a neural mechanism through which the brain deploys perceptual predictions.</p>",
