      "title": "Decoding the mechanisms of acupuncture by neuroimaging: an integrated review from networks to molecules",
      "content": "Acupuncture, a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is widely used for conditions like chronic pain and functional disorders, yet its neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. This review synthesizes findings from multimodal neuroimaging\u2013including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET)\u2013to examine the central nervous system and neurochemical correlates of acupuncture. We summarize reports of its modulatory effects on large-scale brain networks (e.g., Default Mode Network, Salience Network) and neural oscillations, alongside evidence of neurochemical changes. Importantly, we also address the methodological limitations, inconsistent results, and significant role of non-specific (e.g., placebo) effects prevalent in this literature (Chen B. et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024). Building on this evidence, we propose a multi-level integrative framework that outlines a potential pathway from peripheral stimulation to clinical outcomes via neurochemical and network-level interactions, while carefully distinguishing observed correlations from established causation. We conclude by discussing future research priorities, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols, rigorous causal inference, and a measured approach to translating emerging technologies. This review aims to bridge traditional practice with modern neuroscience by offering a balanced perspective that highlights both progress and persistent challenges in the field.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomically informed psychotherapy after mild brain injury: a single-case report of clinical improvement",
      "content": "Psychotherapeutic interventions following acquired brain injury often underestimate the influence of neural connectivity on emotional and cognitive recovery, contributing to treatment response variability. We present a single-case report of an adult with mild acquired brain injury, in whom diffusion tensor imaging (tractography) and neuropsychological assessment were integrated to guide individualized clinical planning. Baseline tractography revealed globally preserved white-matter organization with rightward asymmetries in the uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculi\u2013pathways involved in cognitive\u2013emotional integration. This specific neuroanatomical profile informed a psychotherapeutic plan that prioritized attentional and experiential strategies, being functionally compatible with the preserved networks, over those requiring complex verbal-analytic processing. After 1 year of intervention (approximately 40 sessions), reassessment documented significant functional improvements, quantified by a reduction in anxiety to a non-clinical range (HADS-A: 11 \u2192 6) and a normalization in cognitive flexibility (TMT-B: 190 \u2192 128 s), without observable structural change. These findings validate the hypothesis that therapeutic change may arise from functional optimization within preserved networks rather than anatomical reorganization. This report proposes the functional compatibility framework as a transferable and theoretically grounded model for precision psychotherapy, bridging the gap between neuroscience and clinical practice.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Evaluating haptic experience using EEG and deep learning across multiple modalities: linking stimulus and self-reports",
      "content": "Conventionally, evaluations of haptic interfaces have relied on self-reported assessments, which offer limited objectivity and can disrupt the user experience, making it challenging to design interfaces that dynamically adapt to users' cognitive state in real time. To overcome these limitations, cognitive haptic interfaces leverage neurophysiological measures such as EEG and deep learning to directly capture the brain's responses to haptic stimulation. A key challenge is how to label these neural responses: do we ground models in objectively controlled Physical Stimulation (PS) parameters, or in participants' Self-Reported (SR) perceptions? The goal of this work is not to demonstrate that EEG can reproduce subjective reports, but rather to systematically examine how neural responses relate to these two aspects of haptic experience by training deep learning models under both PS and SR labeling schemes. Here, we investigate how PS- versus SR-based labeling impacts model performance across four modalities: (i) delayed force-feedback (DFF), (ii) fingertip vibration feedback (FVF), (iii) upper-body vibration feedback (UVF), and (iv) fingertip thermal feedback (FTF). We evaluate three deep learning benchmarked architectures: ATCNet, EEG Inception, and EEG Conformer on EEG data labeled according to both approaches. Across all modalities, PS-labeled models yield more stable and higher performance than SR-labeled models in a group-level leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting, with the largest gains at near-perceptual-threshold levels (e.g., mild thermal changes, moderate vibration intensities, borderline delay settings) where SR labels are most variable across individuals. Rather than aiming to replace self-reports, these results reveal when EEG-based models align more closely with the physical stimulation than with participants' reports and support using PS-trained decoders as a structured first-stage representation that can later be adapted with user-specific SR information.",

      "title": "Structural and functional alterations in postmenopausal women with insomnia: an MRI study of Eight-Section Vajra Exercise intervention effects",
      "content": "BackgroundPostmenopausal women exhibit heightened vulnerability to chronic insomnia due to estrogen decline and age-related neural alterations. While non-pharmacological interventions are preferred for long-term management, the neuroplastic mechanisms underlying exercise-based therapies remain poorly characterized.MethodsThis study examines the effects of Eight-Section Vajra Exercise (ESVE) on brain structure and function in postmenopausal women with insomnia (PMWI) using multimodal MRI. A 12-week ESVE training program was completed by PMWI patients, followed by clinical assessments (PSQI, ISI, PHQ-9, GAD-7, FSS, MoCA) and neuroimaging (fMRI and structural MRI). Data analysis involved gray matter volume (GMV), ALFF/fALFF, ReHo, degree centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC) using advanced MRI processing techniques (CAT12, SPM12, DPABI). Group comparisons and correlations were adjusted for age, education, and intracranial volume.ResultAmong the 24 PMWI patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs), baseline measures showed significantly worse sleep and mood scores in PMWI. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced ALFF/fALFF in the right precentral gyrus and decreased ReHo in sensorimotor areas. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) were noted, with altered connections between precentral gyrus, temporal and parietal regions. After 12 weeks of ESVE, 78.95% of PMWI patients were medication-free, with post-treatment fMRI showing improved neural activity and connectivity, correlating with clinical improvement. Exercise adherence positively correlated with sleep quality improvement (r = 0.508\u20130.594, P < 0.05). Responders showed significant improvements in sleep compared to non-responders (P < 0.05).ConclusionESVE alleviates postmenopausal insomnia through PreCG-centered sensorimotor-visual network reorganization, potentially compensating for estrogen-dependent neurocircuitry vulnerabilities. Exercise-induced GMV increases in occipitotemporal regions suggest enhanced sleep-related memory consolidation. Our findings indicate that ESVE is a potential neuromodulatory intervention and identify PreCG-MOG connectivity as a promising biomarker for personalized insomnia management.",

      "content": "IntroductionAuditory beat perception (ABP) is crucial for rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), a therapeutic approach for neurological disorders, and particularly Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The mechanism is thought to be associated with increased activation of the cerebellum and motor-related regions. However, few studies have explored its effects on patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). This study aimed to compare the compensatory mechanism of ABP in patients with PD and MSA.MethodsParticipants with PD and MSA and normal controls (NCs) were recruited from National Cheng Kung University Hospital. During task-based functional MRI (fMRI), the participants listened to rhythmic beat sounds using a boxcar paradigm. Basic characteristics and brain volumes were compared between the PD and MSA groups, and fMRI findings were further compared with the NCs.ResultsThere were no significant differences in age, gender, motor scores or disease duration between PD (n\u202f=\u202f16) and MSA (n\u202f=\u202f14) groups. Brain volume analysis revealed a significant reduction in cerebellar volume in the MSA group. ABP analysis via fMRI demonstrated greater activation in the left premotor cortex in MSA groups compared to NCs. Activation in the right cerebellum was significantly higher in PD group but absent in the MSA group. Different correlation trends between activation and cerebellar volume were observed.ConclusionABP in the PD and MSA groups showed distinct compensatory mechanisms by cerebellar and premotor cortex activation, respectively. These findings provide insights into compensatory mechanisms regarding RAS therapy in patients with atypical parkinsonian disorders.",

      "title": "Brain activation patterns of figurative language comprehension in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) consistently exhibit difficulties in comprehending figurative language. While prior neuroimaging studies have identified discrepancies in brain activation between ASD individuals and neurotypical controls (NCs) during such tasks, the specific and consistent neural patterns underlying these deficits remain unclear.MethodsWe conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify consistent brain activation patterns associated with figurative language comprehension in ASD. A systematic literature search was performed across five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang) up to January 31, 2025. Six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, comprising 95 individuals with ASD and 98 NCs, met the inclusion criteria.ResultsThe analysis revealed that during figurative language comprehension, both ASD and NCs consistently activated a core network involving the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), transverse temporal gyrus, and right insula. A conjunction analysis confirmed the stability of these shared regions. Crucially, the meta-analysis of group differences (NCs\u202f>\u202fASD) identified a significant cluster of hypoactivation in the ASD group within the left STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). No significant hyperactivation was found in the ASD group compared to NCs.ConclusionThis meta-analysis demonstrates that while individuals with ASD recruit typical language networks during figurative language comprehension, they exhibit a consistent pattern of reduced neural recruitment in the left STG and MTG. This hypoactivation may reflect a dual deficit encompassing reduced efficiency in semantic access/integration and impaired socio-linguistic integration, providing a neurobiological substrate for the pragmatic language difficulties characteristic of ASD.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023467185, CRD42023467185.",

      "title": "Organizational Practices and Socio-Technical Design of Human-Centered AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.21492v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This contribution explores how the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational practices can be effectively framed through a socio-technical perspective to comply with the requirements of Human-centered AI (HCAI). Instead of viewing AI merely as a technical tool, the analysis emphasizes the importance of embedding AI into communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes within organizations from a human-centered perspective. Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop.",

      "title": "Are they just delegating? Cross-Sample Predictions on University Students' & Teachers' Use of AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.21490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mutual trust between teachers and students is a prerequisite for effective teaching, learning, and assessment in higher education. Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21460v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: LLM-assisted technologies are increasingly used to support cognitive processing and information interpretation, yet their role in aiding memory recall, and how people choose to engage with them, remains underexplored. We studied participants who watched a short robbery video (approximating a one-time eyewitness scenario) and composed recall statements using either a default GPT or a guided GPT prompted with a standardized eyewitness protocol. Results show that, in the default condition, participants who believed they had a clearer understanding of the event were more likely to trust GPT's output, whereas in the guided condition, participants showed stronger alignment between subjective clarity and actual recall. Additionally, participants evaluated the legitimacy of the individuals in the incident differently across conditions. Interaction analysis further revealed that default-GPT users spontaneously developed diverse strategies, including building on existing recollections, requesting potentially missing details, and treating GPT as a recall coach. This work shows how GPT-user interplay can subconsciously shape beliefs and perceptions of remembered events.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21271v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While visual augmentation dominates the augmented reality landscape, devices like Meta Ray-Ban audio smart glasses signal growing industry movement toward audio augmented reality (AAR). Hearing is a primary channel for sensing context, anticipating change, and navigating social space, yet AAR's everyday potential remains underexplored. We address this gap through a collaborative autoethnography (N=5, authoring) and an online survey (N=74). We identify ten roles for AAR, grouped into three categories: task- and utility-oriented, emotional and social, and perceptual collaborator. These roles are further layered with a rhythmic and embodied collaborator framing, mapping them onto micro-, meso-, and macro-rhythms of everyday life. Our analysis surfaces nuanced tensions, such as blocking distractions without erasing social presence, highlighting the need for context-aware design. This paper contributes a foundational and forward-looking framework for AAR in everyday life, providing design groundwork for systems attuned to daily routines, sensory engagement, and social expectations.",

      "title": "Evaluating Spatialized Auditory Cues for Rapid Attention Capture in XR",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.21264v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21141v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents AnthropoCam, a mobile-based neural style transfer (NST) system optimized for the visual synthesis of Anthropocene environments. Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.\n  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.\n  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.\n  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene.",
