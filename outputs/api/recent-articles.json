      "content": "<p>Easy to use, portable app to play midi music files on all flavours of Microsoft Windows.<p>Brief Background - Used midi playback way back in the days of Windows 95 for some fun and entertaining apps, but as Windows progressed, it seemed their midi support (for Win32 anyway) regressed in both startup speed and reliability.  Midi playback used to be near instant on Windows 95, but on later versions of Windows this was delayed to about 5-7 seconds.  And reliability became somewhat patchy.  This made working with midi a real headache.<p>Cynthia was built to test and enjoy midi music once again.  It's taken over a year of solid coding, recoding, testing, re-testing, and a lot more testing, and some hair pulling along the way, but finally Cynthia works pretty solidly on Windows now.<p>Some of Cynthia's Key Features:\n* 25 built-in sample midis on a virtual disk - play right out-of-the box\n* Play Modes: Once, Repeat One, Repeat All, All Once, Random\n* Play \".mid\", \".midi\" and \".rmi\" midi files in 0 and 1 formats\n* Realtime track data indicators, channel output volume indicators with peak hold, 128 note usage indicators\n* Volume Bars to display realtime average volume and bass volume levels\n* Use an Xbox Controller to control Cynthia's main functions \n* Large list capacity for handling thousands of midi files\n* Switch between up to 10 midi playback devices in realtime\n* Playback through a single midi device, or multiple simultaneous midi devices with lag and channel output support\n* Custom built midi playback engine for high playback stability\n* Custom built codebase for low-level work to GUI level\n* Also runs on Linux/Mac (including apple silicon) via Wine\n* Smart Source Code - compiles in Borland Delphi 3 and Lazarus 2 \n* MIT License<p>YouTube Video of Cynthia playing a midi:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ</a><p>GitHub Repo:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
      "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",
