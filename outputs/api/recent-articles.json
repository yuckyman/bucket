      "title": "Semantic reasoning takes place largely outside the language network",
      "content": "The brain's language network is often implicated in the representation and manipulation of abstract semantic knowledge. However, this view is inconsistent with a large body of evidence suggesting that language processing is neurally distinct from the rest of cognition. Here, we use precision brain imaging to uncover a set of brain regions, separate from the language network, that are engaged in semantic processing of both linguistic and pictorial stimuli. In three fMRI experiments, participants (total n=41 tested across 49 sessions) viewed sentences and pictures depicting simple events. In separate blocks, they performed either a semantic task or a difficulty-matched perceptual task. Across all three experiments, several areas in left lateral prefrontal cortex, left temporo-parietal cortex, and right cerebellum responded to semantic tasks for both sentences and pictures. These semantic processing areas are spatially and functionally distinct from the nearby language-selective areas, as well as from the multiple demand and default mode networks, exhibiting a unique response profile. Our results provide evidence for a new kind of selectivity in the human brain and pave the way for future explorations of the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic reasoning.",

      "title": "Gait transition mechanism from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion in the Japanese macaque based on inverted pendulum",
      "content": "The ability of non-human primates to transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion offers critical insights into both the evolution of human bipedalism and the principles of complex motor control. While quadrupedal and bipedal gaits in non-human primates have been studied, the dynamic mechanisms underlying the transition between these gaits remain poorly understood. Japanese macaques trained to walk bipedally have been reported to utilize inverted pendulum dynamics to achieve efficient bipedal locomotion. Given the intrinsic instability of inverted pendulum systems, which can induce large changes in movement with minimal control input, we hypothesized that this mechanism also contributes to the gait transition. To test this, we developed a neuromusculoskeletal model of the Japanese macaque that integrates a detailed musculoskeletal structure with a physiologically inspired motor control system. Through forward dynamics simulations, we generated a variety of movement patterns by systematically parameterizing motor commands, including failed transitions that are difficult to capture experimentally. We then applied dynamical systems analysis using on an inverted pendulum model to examine the underlying principles of the transition process. Our results demonstrate that successful gait transitions depend on generating an inverted pendulum motion through appropriate control of the forward step length of one hindlimb. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how Japanese macaques coordinate their complex musculoskeletal systems to perform skilled, full-body movements in the gait transition, offering a deeper understanding of both advanced motor control and the evolution of human bipedalism.",

      "title": "Diminished spatial dynamics and maladaptive spatial complexity link resting brain network disruption to cognition in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Resting-state fMRI studies increasingly emphasize the dynamic nature of brain networks. While most approaches examine temporal fluctuations in connectivity, we focus on the spatial dynamics and complexity at voxel level - how networks expand and contract, and change their structural complexity over time. Using dynamic independent component analysis (ICA), we investigate the hierarchical structure of the resulting time-varying spatial networks, from their broad periphery to their most active core. We combine this with fractal dimension (FrD) as a measure of a network's spatial complexity and analyze temporal changes (dynamic flexibility) in a network and synchronized fluctuations between network pairs (fractal dimension coupling, FrDC). We refer to this approach as 'dynamic spatial network complexity and connectivity (dSNCC)'. Using a combined cohort of 508 subjects (315 healthy controls, 193 schizophrenia patients), we found that schizophrenia is associated with higher mean FrD in several networks, suggesting more irregular patterns/boundaries and a disorganized network structure. Critically, patients showed significantly reduced dynamic flexibility, indicating their networks are 'stuck' in a less adaptable state. This robust finding is evidenced by a synergistic loss of temporal standard deviations in both network volume and FrD across multiple networks and activity thresholds. This maladaptive complexity was associated with cognitive impairment, with several dSNCC measures showing significant associations with subject scores for processing speed, visual learning, and verbal learning. Higher complexity in these networks and more significantly, their reduced dynamic flexibility as seen in patients, were particularly associated with impaired performance. Furthermore, we found aberrant connectivity (FrDC) in schizophrenia, with certain network pairs exhibiting overly synchronized complexity changes. Our results demonstrate that dSNCC is a powerful tool for characterizing network dynamics and may potentially provide a measurable mechanism for maladaptation in schizophrenia, where the brain's inability to fluidly change its complexity may contribute to cognitive deficits and symptoms like disorganized thought. These findings highlight the importance of studying the intrinsic spatial dynamic properties to reveal the fundamental principles of brain network organization in health and disease. Our work represents a significant leap in complex systems neuroscience and provides a novel, quantifiable biomarker framework highly relevant for understanding and targeting other complex disorders characterized by network dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, or other mental health conditions.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
