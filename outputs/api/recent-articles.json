      "title": "Electroencephalography differences in children with and without bilateral cerebral palsy during unimanual and bimanual drumming tasks",
      "content": "BackgroundMultiple studies have examined bimanual coordination in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) with few in bilateral CP and none utilized electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates brain activation underlying bimanual performance in individuals with bilateral CP and typical development (TD).MethodsTwenty-six participants (13 CP; 13 TD) completed the Box and Block Test (BBT) and visually cued drumming tasks with each hand (unimanual) and then with both hands synchronously and asynchronously (bimanual). EEG and motion data were recorded during drumming tasks.ResultsChildren with CP demonstrated bilateral impairments in drumming cadence and BBT, increased alpha and beta and decreased gamma EEG band activation in mainly non-dominant brain regions compared to TD. Bimanual tasks tended to show decreased performance and greater alpha and beta band activation than unimanual tasks for both groups. EEG activity and BBT correlations were positive in TD, but negative in CP.DiscussionThis study showed that children with CP had worse motor performance bilaterally and EEG activation differences from TD similar to previous unimanual findings in bilateral CP, however, a more complex bimanual task may have uncovered greater differences.ConclusionEvidence of bimanual deficits and EEG differences reinforces the need for greater research and clinical attention on upper limb function in bilateral CP.",

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",
