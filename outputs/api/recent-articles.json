      "content": "Community detection is a crucial task in network research, applicable to social systems, biology, cybersecurity, and knowledge graphs. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant representational capability; yet, they frequently experience instability and erroneous clustering, often referred to as \u201dhallucinations.\u201d These artifacts stem from sensitivity to high-frequency eigenmodes, over-parameterization, and noise amplification, undermining the robustness of learned communities. To mitigate these constraints, we present F2-CommNet, a Fourier\u2013Fractional neural framework that incorporates fractional-order dynamics, spectrum filtering, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The fractional operator implements long-memory dampening that mitigates oscillations, whereas Fourier spectral projections selectively attenuate eigenmodes susceptible to hallucination. Theoretical analysis delineates certain stability criteria under Lipschitz non-linearities and constrained disturbances, resulting in a demonstrable expansion of the Lyapunov margin. Experimental validation on synthetic and actual networks indicates that F2-CommNet reliably diminishes hallucination indices, enhances stability margins, and produces interpretable communities in comparison to integer-order GNN baselines. This study integrates fractional calculus, spectral graph theory, and neural network dynamics, providing a systematic method for hallucination-resistant community discovery.",

      "title": "Towards robust probabilistic maps in Deep Brain Stimulation: exploring the impact of patient number, stimulation counts, and statistical approaches",
      "content": "IntroductionProbabilistic Stimulation Maps (PSMs) are increasingly employed to identify brain regions associated with optimal therapeutic outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). However, their reliability and generalizability are challenged by the limited size of most patient cohorts and the inherent variability introduced by different statistical methods and input data configurations. This study aimed to investigate the geometrical variability of Probabilistic Sweet Spots (PSS) as a function of both the number of patients (nPat) and the number of stimulations per patient (nStim), and to model a stability boundary defining the minimum data requirements for obtaining geometrically stable PSS.MethodsThree statistical approaches\u2013Bayesian t-test, Wilcoxon test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and Wilcoxon test with nonparametric permutation correction\u2013were applied to two patient cohorts: a primary cohort of 36 patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and a secondary cohort of 61 patients treated for Essential Tremor (ET), used to assess generalizability. Stimulation test data was collected intra-operatively for the first cohort and post-operatively for the second one. Geometric stability was evaluated based on variability in PSS volume extent and centroid location.ResultsThe analysis revealed a non-linear trade-off between nPat and nStim to yield stable PSS. A stability boundary was defined, representing the minimum combinations of nPat\u2013nStim required for anatomically robust PSS. Among the tested methods, the Bayesian t-test achieved stability with smaller sample sizes (\u223c15 patients) and demonstrated a consistent performance across both cohorts. In contrast, the Wilcoxon-based methods showed variable behavior between cohorts, which differed in symptom type and testing phase (intra-operative testing vs. post-operative screening).DiscussionThe proposed PSS stability boundary provides a practical reference for designing DBS studies and stimulation screening protocols aimed at probabilistic mapping. The Bayesian t-test emerged as a reliable method across both cohorts, supporting its potential in studies with limited sample sizes and scenarios where the method needs to be readily generalized to varying symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cohort size and stimulation count in probabilistic DBS mapping and call for further investigation into method-specific sensitivities to clinical and procedural factors.",

      "content": "Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a cognitive dysfunction of the brain caused by the tumor itself and antitumor treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and surgery. As a common complication of cancer, CRCI significantly affects patients\u2019 quality of life. In recent years, the neurobiological mechanisms of CRCI have garnered widespread attention. Research indicates that cancer-related therapies lead to CRCI by affecting brain structure, function, metabolism, and blood perfusion. Various neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG), have been extensively employed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of CRCI. This article reviews recent advancements in neuroimaging research on CRCI, focusing on its influencing factors and the neural mechanisms underlying different cognitive domains, and summarizes findings from relevant animal model studies.",

      "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

      "title": "Seasonal blood-brain barrier plasticity links environmental cues to migratory behavior in monarch butterflies",
      "content": "Seasonal migration requires animals to reversibly switch behavioral states in response to environmental cues, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. Monarch butterflies provide a powerful model, as Eastern North American populations undergo a long-distance southward migration in the fall followed by a cold-dependent reversal in flight orientation after overwintering each spring. Here, we show that cold exposure induces coordinated transcriptional changes in the monarch brain, marked by attenuated integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cold-exposed monarchs exhibit increased penetration of fluorescent markers into the brain, consistent with increased BBB permeability. Notably, our findings align with previous genomic evidence identifying collagen type IV alpha 1, a major ECM component, as a locus under divergent selection between migratory and non-migratory populations. Together, these results implicate seasonal modulation of BBB permeability as a mechanism linking environmental temperature to plastic migratory behavior and identify the BBB as a dynamic interface through which seasonal cues may reprogram neural function and behavior.",

      "content": "Accurate detection of impending collisions is essential for survival. While multiple subcortical pathways have been found in the detection of looming stimuli, the roles of top-down attention and consciousness in this process remains unclear. Using high-resolution fMRI, we investigated how top-down attention and conscious awareness influence the subcortical processing of collision trajectories in healthy participants and hemianopic patients with cortical blindness. In healthy participants, the superior colliculus (SC)-parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN)-amygdala pathway integrated binocular information for accurate detection of collision trajectories in the upper visual field, but only when participants were paying attention to the looming stimuli. On the other hand, for stimuli presented in the blind visual field of hemianopic patients, effective connectivity analyses revealed collision sensitivity in the SC-pulvinar and SC-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways, supporting automatic collision detection even in the absence of visual awareness. Together, these findings suggest that distinct subcortical pathways mediate collision detection in the human brain depending on the presence and absence of attention and conscious awareness.",

      "title": "Progranulin deficiency induces lipid droplet accumulation in microglia via a STAT3-GPAT3 axis",
      "content": "Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) encoding gene GRN cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas homozygous GRN mutations lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration due to PGRN deficiency remain unclear. In the aged brains or under neurodegenerative conditions, the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in microglia contributes to cellular dysfunction and pro-inflammatory responses, exacerbating neurodegenerative pathology. Here, we investigated how PGRN deficiency induces LD accumulation in microglia. We found that PGRN ablation significantly upregulated triglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), the first and rate-limiting enzyme for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and increased LD formation in both Grn-/- BV2 microglial cells and Grn-/- mouse brains. Mechanistic study revealed that PGRN deficiency upregulates GPAT3 via stimulating signal transduction and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) signaling. Silencing Gpat3, inhibiting GPAT3 activity with the small molecule inhibitor FSG67, or PGRN restoration reduced LD accumulation and rescued the cytotoxicity of Grn-/- microglia conditional medium (MCM) toward N2a cells. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of FSG67 or AAV-MG1.2-mCx3cr1-mGrn-eGFP-mediated microglia-specific gene therapy reduced microglial LDs and ameliorated behavior phenotypes in Grn-/- mice. Our study elucidates the role of PGRN loss in microglial lipid homeostasis and identifies the STAT3-GPAT3 axis as a potential therapeutic target for LD-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "IntroductionExposure to violence has been associated with alterations in how the brain organizes thought, regulates emotions, and guides behavior. In Colombia, decades of armed conflict have generated heterogeneous patterns of cognitive vulnerability, yet evidence on executive and emotional functioning in adult victims remains limited.MethodsThis cross-sectional study compared executive and emotional functioning between victims and non-victims of the Colombian armed conflict. A total of 300 middle-aged adults from the Department of Bol\u00edvar were assessed using a neuropsychological battery (MMSE, Tower of Hanoi, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and Frontal Assessment Battery) and emotional screening instruments (GAD-7 and PHQ-2). Executive function was modeled as a latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Random Forest was implemented as a complementary, assumption-free analytic strategy.ResultsVictims showed significantly poorer performance in planning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control (\u03b2 = \u20130.178; p = 0.024). Educational attainment emerged as the strongest predictor of executive functioning (\u03b2 = \u20130.249; p < 0.001). The factorial model showed modest fit (CFI = 0.76), reflecting ecological and educational heterogeneity. Machine learning analyses converged with latent-variable results, identifying exposure to violence and structural inequalities as the strongest predictors of executive variability, whereas emotional factors played a marginal role.DiscussionThe findings delineate a cognitive profile associated with conflict-related victimization, characterized by vulnerabilities in executive control processes. These results underscore the need for clinical and public policy interventions that integrate neuroscientific approaches to strengthen planning and decision-making capacities in populations affected by armed conflict.",

      "title": "The influence of class mobility on pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures: evidence from ERPs",
      "content": "IntroductionAs a privileged group within the social structure, the wealthy play a significant role in social philanthropy and public welfare initiatives, making their empathic capacity a subject of considerable interest. Previous research has found that wealthy individuals who have experienced upward class mobility paradoxically demonstrate reduced empathy toward the poor. However, these studies were predominantly conducted in individualistic cultural contexts, leaving the collectivist cultural perspective largely unexplored.MethodsThe present study employed a virtual-society paradigm to experimentally simulate class mobility in a collectivist context. Objective mobility direction (upward vs. horizontal) and subjective evaluation of mobility (positive vs. negative) were manipulated to construct four types of wealthy roles (upward-positive, upward-negative, horizontal-positive, horizontal-negative). Chinese university students from a collectivist cultural background were instructed to sequentially adopt each wealthy role and judge painful versus neutral pictures of the same low-status target, while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.ResultsThe results revealed that in the early N2 component, under upward mobility conditions, pain stimuli elicited significantly smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli, while no significant difference was observed under horizontal mobility conditions. In positive evaluation conditions, pain stimuli evoked significantly smaller N2 amplitudes than neutral stimuli, whereas no significant difference emerged in negative evaluation conditions. For the late LPP component, pain stimuli consistently elicited significantly larger LPP amplitudes than neutral stimuli, regardless of either the objective direction of class mobility or subjective evaluation.DiscussionThese findings suggest that, within this simulated class-mobility context, upward mobility experiences and positive appraisal primarily influence early neural processing of the poor target\u2019s pain, while later evaluative processing remains relatively stable. This study provides neural-level evidence for understanding how class mobility affects pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures, thereby enriching research on the relationship between social stratification and pain empathy.",

      "title": "Neuromotor adaptations in people with Parkinson's Disease following a 12-month multimodal non-contact boxing intervention",
      "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder that diminishes neuromotor control. Exercise training provides a nonpharmacological treatment option that may help motor symptom severity and trajectory. In the present case series, we assessed linear and non-linear measures of neuromotor control along with functional measures of mobility in six men living with PD across a year of multimodal exercise training. Our measurements encompassed mobility, balance, strength, and force control metrics and were captured at baseline as well as at defined intervals following exercise engagement. The results appear to indicate a favorable preservation of functional ability and neuromotor control for most of the cohort across the yearlong exercise intervention. Our linear measures of neuromotor control generally remained stable with slight improvements from baseline to month 12, with visually distinct trends for our non-linear measures (Sample Entropy) of neuromotor control suggestive of more adaptive motor control strategies for both postural and force control. These data corroborate reports showing favorable outcomes for people with Parkinson's Disease following exercise engagement. Our year-long assessment of neuromotor control in a cohort of men with Parkinson's disease provides a novel contribution to the trajectory of change in this population while undergoing multimodal exercise training.",

      "content": "Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy primarily caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline. We present a case of a 42-year-old Chinese woman with a rapidly progressive syndrome featuring prominent apathy, cognitive impairment, and hypoactivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3) predominantly in frontal and parietal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Comprehensive genetic testing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CSF1R gene (c.2342C\u202f>\u202fT, p.Ala781Val), located within the tyrosine kinase domain, confirming the Diagnosis of HDLS. This case highlights early apathy and hypoactivity as red-flag manifestations of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy in a 42-year-old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. The atypical presentation, initially mimicking psychiatric or demyelinating disease, underscores the need to consider CSF1R sequencing when encountering early-onset cognitive or behavioral deterioration with unexplained white-matter changes, thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

      "content": "BackgroundAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder frequently marked by poor treatment response and chronic progression toward rigid, restrictive behaviors. These features highlight the need for innovative strategies targeting core mechanisms and symptoms of the disorder. This feasibility trial evaluates individualized intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual, with the goal of identifying patient-specific targets and paving the way for personalized neuromodulation in AN.MethodsThirty-four adults with AN (\u226518 years, illness \u226512 months, \u22651 prior unsuccessful treatment) will be randomized (1:1) to 20 sessions of real or sham iTBS over 4 weeks. Stimulation will be delivered with a MagPro system and a Cool B70 A/P active/sham coil; motor threshold will be estimated with the Stochastic Approximator (SAMT) and re-checked weekly. Individualized stimulation target will be defined based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to identify the cortical region within the PPC that is maximally functionally connected with the activity of two meta-analytically derived networks representing body representation and implicit behavioral tendencies. Coil placement will be neuronavigated on individual T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and 4-month follow-up (T2), covering clinical status (body mass index (BMI), psychopathology, and quality of life), experimental tasks (implicit body representation, peripersonal space, approach\u2013avoidance tendencies toward food, interoceptive accuracy, and neurocognitive functioning), and MRI. Feasibility endpoints include recruitment, retention, completion, blinding, and tolerability. Ethics approval: 6168/EST/25; registration: NCT07106645.DiscussionThis trial emphasizes individualized PPC targeting and rigorous motor threshold (MT) estimation to advance personalized neuromodulation in AN. Feasibility and effect-size data will guide a confirmatory randomized clinical trial, while mechanistic analyses will test whether targeted iTBS strengthens body-schema circuits and aligns neural changes with clinical improvement, supporting a precision-psychiatry approach to eating disorders.Trail registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07106645, identifier NCT07106645.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been working on a research project called <strong>Information Transform Compression (ITC)</strong>, a compiler that treats neural networks as information systems, not parameter graphs, and optimises them by preserving information value rather than numerical fidelity.</p> <p><strong>Github Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/makangachristopher/Information-Transform-Compression\">https://github.com/makangachristopher/Information-Transform-Compression</a></p> <p><strong>What this project does.</strong></p> <p>ITC is a compiler-style optimization system for neural networks that analyzes models through an information-theoretic lens and systematically rewrites them into smaller, faster, and more efficient forms while preserving their behavior. It parses networks into an intermediate representation, measures per-layer information content using entropy, sensitivity, and redundancy, and computes an Information Density Metric (IDM) to guide optimizations such as adaptive mixed-precision quantization, structural pruning, and architecture-aware compression. By focusing on compressing the least informative components rather than applying uniform rules, ITC achieves high compression ratios with predictable accuracy, producing deployable models without retraining or teacher models, and integrates seamlessly into standard PyTorch workflows for inference.</p> <p><strong>The motivation:</strong><br /> Most optimization tools in ML (quantization, pruning, distillation) treat all parameters as roughly equal. In practice, they aren\u2019t. Some parts of a model carry a lot of <em>meaning</em>, others are largely redundant, but we don\u2019t measure that explicitly.</p> <p><strong>The idea:</strong><br /> ITC treats a neural network as an <strong>information system</strong>, not just a parameter graph. </p> <p><strong>Comparison with existing alternatives</strong></p> <p>Other ML optimisation tools answer:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cHow many parameters can we remove?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>ITC answers:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cHow much information does this part of the model need to preserve?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>That distinction turns compression into a compiler problem, not a post-training hack.</p> <p>To do this, the system computes per-layer (and eventually per-substructure) measures of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Entropy</strong> (how diverse the information is),</li> <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> (how much output changes if it\u2019s perturbed),</li> <li><strong>Redundancy</strong> (overlap with other parts),</li> </ul> <p>and combines them into a single score called <strong>Information Density (IDM)</strong>.</p> <p>That score then drives decisions like:</p> <ul> <li>Mixed-precision quantization (not uniform INT8),</li> <li>Structural pruning (not rule-based),</li> <li>Architecture-aware compression.</li> </ul> <p>Conceptually, it\u2019s closer to a <strong>compiler pass</strong> than a post-training trick.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>ITC is <strong>production-ready</strong>, even though it is <strong>not yet a drop-in production replacement</strong> for established toolchains.</p> <p>It is best suited for:</p> <ul> <li>Researchers exploring model compression, efficiency, or information theory</li> <li>Engineers working on edge deployment, constrained inference, or model optimization</li> <li>Developers interested in compiler-style approaches to ML systems</li> </ul> <p>The current implementation is:</p> <ul> <li>Stable and usable via CLI and Python API</li> <li>Suitable for experimentation, benchmarking, and integration into research pipelines</li> <li>Intended as a foundation for future production-grade tooling rather than a finished product</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lower_Painting1036\"> /u/Lower_Painting1036 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qipius/ive_been_working_on_an_informationaware_compiler/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qipius/ive_been_working_on_an_informationaware_compiler/\">[comments]</a></span>",
