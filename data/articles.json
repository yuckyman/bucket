    "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Peripheral modulation of Pumilio in intestinal stem cells and the corpus allatum affects sleep latency in Drosophila",
    "content": "While central circuits governing sleep are well-studied, the contribution of signaling from peripheral tissues remains a critical yet less understood aspect of sleep regulation. The highly conserved RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum) is a post-transcriptional regulator expressed in multiple tissues that influence systemic physiology, but its role in modulating basal sleep has not been established. Although Pumilios function in central neurons has been linked to sleep homeostasis following deprivation, whether it regulates sleep through peripheral mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we use conditional genetic tools in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate that Pumilio acts in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the endocrinecorpus allatum (CA) to specifically regulate the transition to sleep. Reducing Pumilio function in either the ISCs or the CA independently and significantly accelerates nighttime sleep onset, while overexpression produces the opposite effect. This behavioral change is accompanied by widespread transcriptional alterations in the brain, characterized by a robust upregulation of genes involved in cellular stress responses, including Heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83). Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-endocrine-brain signaling axis and identify peripheral post-transcriptional regulation as a key input to the central control of sleep behavior.",

    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Changes in hemispheric dominance following targeted muscle reinnervation: a case study",
    "content": "Phantom limb pain (PLP) after amputation is a multifaceted condition. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) surgery coapts amputated nerves to motor nerves of regional muscles, closing the neuromuscular loop, enabling improved myoelectric prosthesis control and reducing PLP. Long-term effects of TMR and residual limb use have been observed; however, the short-term neural changes and their timeline are not understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the cortical changes shortly after TMR without a prosthesis, specifically the functional connectivity and hemispheric dominance during a motor task involving the affected limb. The case participant is a male 52\u202fyears old, with a left traumatic transradial amputation sustained 4\u202fyears earlier, scheduled for TMR surgery. Data was collected before and 2 months after TMR. Brain activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while the participant performed a gross manual dexterity task (box and block test) using their phantom hand. Pain levels were assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Following TMR, the participant reported a VAS score of 0 and increased use of the amputated limb in daily activities. fNIRS analysis during the affected limb task showed a reduction in interhemispheric functional connectivity, prominently in the primary sensory cortex, where the average z-value decreased from 0.29 to 0.12 after TMR. In contrast, connectivity between the premotor and supplementary motor areas increased slightly, from 0.08 to 0.12. Overall, intrahemispheric correlations decreased, with opposite patterns observed across hemispheres. The largest changes occurred ipsilaterally: connectivity between the primary motor and sensory areas increased from 0.23 to 0.27, while contralaterally it decreased from 0.22 to 0.16. Conversely, connectivity between the primary motor and premotor areas increased contralaterally but decreased ipsilaterally. Hemispheric dominance calculated through the Laterality index (LI) shifted from bilateral (LI\u202f=\u202f0.079) to ipsilateral (LI\u202f=\u202f0.59), primarily driven by reduced activation in the contralateral primary motor cortex. These findings suggest that TMR alone can elicit measurable cortical changes in the early post-surgical period, alongside improvements in pain and functional limb use. They also support fNIRS as a non-invasive method for monitoring neural adaptation after TMR and enhance understanding of PLP mechanisms and recovery timelines.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "content": "IntroductionMotor-imagery (MI) brain\u2013computer interfaces often suffer from limited EEG datasets and redundant channels, hampering both accuracy and clinical usability. We address these bottlenecks by presenting a unified framework that simultaneously boosts classification performance, reduces the number of required sensors, and eliminates the need for extra recordings.MethodsA three-stage pipeline is proposed. (1) Wavelet-packet decomposition (WPD) partitions each MI class into low-variance \u201cstable\u201d and high-variance \u201cvariant\u201d trials; sub-band swapping between matched pairs generates synthetic trials that preserve event-related desynchronization/synchronization signatures. (2) Channel selection uses wavelet-packet energy entropy (WPEE) to quantify both spectral-energy complexity and class-separability; the top-ranked leads are retained. (3) A lightweight multi-branch network extracts multi-scale temporal features through parallel dilated convolutions, refines spatial patterns via depth-wise convolutions, and feeds the fused spatiotemporal tensor to a Transformer encoder with multi-head self-attention; soft-voted fully-connected layers deliver robust class labels.ResultsOn BCI Competition IV 2a and PhysioNet MI datasets the proposed method achieves 86.81 and 86.64% mean accuracies, respectively, while removing 27% of sensors. These results outperform the same network trained on all 22 channels, and paired t-tests confirm significant improvements (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).DiscussionIntegrating WPD-based augmentation with WPEE-driven channel selection yields higher MI decoding accuracy with fewer channels and without extra recordings. The framework offers a computationally efficient, clinically viable paradigm for enhanced EEG classification in resource-constrained settings.",

    "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

    "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "The optic tectum and pretectum have been implicated in hunting behaviour in several species but how activity in these regions is coordinated to control target-directed orienting manoeuvres is not understood. We performed two-photon calcium imaging across these brain regions in larval zebrafish, which revealed space and rate-coded premotor activity associated with graded, prey-directed eye and tail movements. Consistent with imaging data, intensity-modulated optogenetic stimulation of pretectum induced progressively more lateralised contraversive orienting behaviour and spatially patterned stimulation of optic tectum revealed a motor map along the anterior-posterior axis that primarily generated ipsiversive responses. Anatomical tracing and laser axotomies indicated that pretectal neurons control contraversive turns via a crossed pretectobulbar pathway whereas optic tectum shows topographically patterned output with a major uncrossed projection to hindbrain. Our data support a model in which premotor activity across pretectum and optic tectum collectively controls predatory orienting via both crossed and uncrossed (pre)-tectobulbar pathways.",

    "title": "Hippocampal indexing alters the stability landscape of synaptic weight space allowing life-long learning",
    "content": "Systems-level consolidation holds that the hippocampus rapidly encodes new information during wakefulness, and that coordinated cortico-hippocampal replay during subsequent sleep transfers and stabilizes those traces in cortex. This idea captures key learning principles, but exactly how replay reshapes the synaptic-weight landscape - creating new representations while preserving old ones - remains unclear. To address this, we used a biophysically realistic network model to probe the effects of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on synaptic-weight space. We show that previously learned memories are stable attractors in that space, and that hippocampus-driven interactions between sharp-wave ripples and cortical slow waves push the system into new attractor states that jointly encode old and new memories. As a result, replay allows recently acquired information to be incorporated without degrading prior memories. Our results offer a novel mechanistic - and conveniently 'geometric' - framework for understanding how sleep-driven replay sculpts synaptic weights during consolidation.",

    "title": "The role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in synaptic transmission during ischemia and recovery",
    "content": "Cerebral ischemia impairs neuronal and glial function, ranging from synaptic failure to irreversible damage. The effects of ischemia on excitatory synaptic transmission remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model including the first full implementation of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (GG-cycle), which is essential for proper functioning of glutamatergic synapses. We simulate a presynaptic neuron and an astrocyte in a finite extracellular space (ECS), surrounded by an oxygen bath, as a proxy for energy supply. The model includes ionic currents with corresponding channels and transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase. To model synaptic transmission, we combine calcium-dependent glutamate release, its uptake by the sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), and the GG-cycle, including glutamine synthesis. We simulate ischemia by blocking energy supply completely. The neuron enters a depolarization block, ion concentrations reach pathological values, and glutamate accumulates in the ECS while glutamate release is disrupted. Surprisingly, we found that synaptic transmission failure was not primarily caused by excessive glutamate release nor by failure of glutamine synthetase. Instead, it mainly resulted from EAAT dysfunction, driven by the collapse of the sodium gradient. Enhancing glutamate clearance alone was insufficient for recovery of synaptic transmission. However, inhibition of the voltage-gated Na+ channels restored ion gradients, recovered glutamate uptake, and re-enabled glutamate release. Taken together, our study highlights the critical role of ion homeostasis, in particular the sodium gradient, in maintaining synaptic function during metabolic stress. Moreover, the model provides a better understanding of synaptic transmission failure and potential recovery strategies during ischemia.",

    "title": "Crosstalk of noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in astrocytes of the murine olfactory bulb",
    "content": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and Ca2+ are ubiquitous second messengers that regulate gene expression, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. Here, we identified a complex interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways in mouse olfactory bulb astrocytes. Norepinephrine (NE) elevated both Ca2+ and cAMP levels via 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors, whereas {beta} receptors triggered only cAMP responses. The 1 receptor agonist phenylephrine increased cAMP, but this effect was suppressed when Ca2+ elevations were blocked by Ca2+ depletion and removal of external Ca2+. We found that 1A and 1D receptors are key targets for phenylephrine, acting through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC3 downstream of 1 receptor activation. Moreover, 2 receptor stimulation raised Ca2+ levels, thereby stimulating cAMP production, yet also reduced forskolin-induced cAMP elevations, indicating that 2 receptors can both inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi and stimulate AC1/AC3 via Ca2+ signaling. Together, these findings reveal intricate crosstalk between noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in olfactory bulb astrocytes mediated by all three adrenergic receptor subtypes.",

    "title": "Toward precision EEG: Assessing the reliability of individual-level ERPs across EEG Systems",
    "content": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) are among the most established tools for studying the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. Advancing toward precision EEG, however, places new demands for a better understanding of how reliable neural markers are at the individual subject level. We conducted two complementary experiments to examine the reliability of N100 and P300 components in an auditory oddball paradigm with three sounds (Standard, Target, and Novel). In Experiment 1, we evaluated the consistency at both the group level and the individual level across four EEG systems: one research-grade wired system (BioSemi) and three mobile devices - Smarting, DSI-24, and EPOC X. At the group level, all systems demonstrated the canonical N100 and P300 components; however, the EPOC X system showed a significantly reduced signal-to-noise ratio compared to the others. At the individual level, temporal and spatial clustering analyses showed that N100 and P300 components were detectable in most individuals (70-85%), with additional significant responses appearing outside this range. We further calculated the similarity of individual responses across participants (typicality index), which revealed highly consistent responses to Standard and Novel sounds, alongside divergent patterns of responses to Targets. In Experiment 2, we assessed the within-participant reliability of N100 and P300 using a test-retest design. Results indicated high within-participant consistency of response patterns for all three stimuli, demonstrating that individual ERPs remain reliably stable over time, even when they deviate from canonical group-level patterns. The current study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the utility and reliability of ERP-based metrics for precision imaging and highlights important methodological considerations for their practical implementation.",

    "title": "Physical determinants of perceived vibration intensity: Insights from haptic feedback given at the wrist",
    "content": "Understanding how controlled mechanical vibrations applied to the skin translate into tactile sensations is key in advancing our understanding of somatosensory perception and using this in haptic applications. Prior research has established psychophysical thresholds and discrimination levels for vibrotactile stimuli, yet less is known about tactile intensity perception. Understanding the signaling of tactile intensity and how mechanical dynamics of skin transmission shape this is critical for providing effective graded haptic feedback. We investigated how modifying the frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape of vibration at the wrist influence free ratings of perceived tactile intensity. Two accelerometers recorded mechanical signals: one embedded within the vibrotactile wristband and another placed 1 cm away on the skin, enabling tracking of vibration propagation through the tissue. We found that perceived intensity was determined by all three parameters, but each had a distinct role. Vibration frequency exerted a non-linear influence, with perceived intensity peaking around 150 Hz, which also corresponded to the actuator's mechanical resonance, with lower secondary peaks for square and sawtooth waveforms in-line with vibratory harmonics. Moreover, square waves were consistently rated as most intense. Vibration amplitude provided a consistent scaling of perceived strength, which was strongly correlated with both actuator and skin acceleration, indicating that skin-transmitted accelerations retained the stimulation profile. We find that the skin acts as a non-linear, frequency-dependent mechanical filter that selectively modulates vibration transmission. Understanding these determinants provides insights for the design of wearable haptic devices and how these can be used to provide graded feedback during tactile interactions.",

    "title": "How to Improve the Reliability of Aperiodic Parameter Estimates in M/EEG: A Method Comparison and Recommendations for Best Practices",
    "content": "Interest in broadband aperiodic, non-oscillatory brain activity (1/f phenomenon) has increased exponentially over recent years, partly fueled by the development of tools to parameterize it (i.e., estimate its offset/intercept and exponent/slope) using the M/EEG power spectrum. Broadband aperiodic activity needs to be separated from narrowband periodic activity before its parameters are computed. A popular method, the fooof toolbox (Donoghue et al., 2020), is based on the data-driven detection of narrowband-periodic peaks, whose maximum number is set by the user. While increasing analytic flexibility, variability in the number of detected peaks may increase sensitivity to noise and reduce the reliability of aperiodic parameter estimates and the power of analytic pipelines. Here, we present an investigation of the effects of several analytic choices (e.g., number of peaks, spectral estimation method) on metrics indicating the adequacy of spectral parametrization. These metrics include the internal consistency (odd-even reliability) of aperiodic estimates, the number of outliers generated, and their ability to detect effects. Across two different data sets (resting state and task-based) we found a decrease in the reliability of intercept and slope estimates as more peaks were allowed to be extracted. To ameliorate this problem, we propose a theory-driven modification of fooof labelled censored regression, whereby the same range of frequencies expected to contain periodic activity is removed from all spectra, and the remaining power values are regressed on the remaining frequencies to obtain parameter estimates. This method shows superior reliability and accuracy compared to fooof. Our findings thus provide suggestions for best practices for estimating 1/f parameters.",

    "content": "Neural oscillations support cognition and perception by organizing information across oscillatory cycles, such that different phases correspond to distinct computational states. Although animal studies strongly support this view, evidence in humans is mixed and largely based on brief, flashed stimuli. Here, we tested whether alpha oscillations, the dominant human brain rhythm, rhythmically modulate visual encoding during sustained perception. EEG was recorded while participants viewed long-lasting (2s) Gabor patches. Using a phase-dependent decoding approach, we extracted EEG activity at specific alpha phases and quantified stimulus decoding accuracy. Decoding performance varied systematically with alpha phase, following a smooth unimodal profile that peaked over occipito-parietal electrodes. These effects emerged well after stimulus onset, indicating a sustained modulation of visual processing during continuous input. Our findings demonstrate that visual information is encoded more accurately at specific alpha phases. This provides direct evidence that sensory processing is gated by intrinsic brain activity and introduces a generalizable decoding framework for linking oscillatory phase to neural information processing.",

    "content": "Minimally verbal autistic individuals (mvASD) are often presumed to have severe cognitive and language impairments based on their poor performance on standardized assessments requiring voluntary motor responses, such as pointing. However, emerging evidence suggests that these individuals may possess latent cognitive abilities. Here, we introduce the Cued Looking Paradigm (CLP), a novel eye-tracking method that bypasses motor requirements by capturing involuntary gaze responses to language-based stimuli. In our study, 35 minimally verbal autistic adolescents and adults were presented with spoken or written words, followed by a pair of images (target and foil) as their eye movements were recorded. The majority (83%) of mvASD participants demonstrated hidden receptive language and reading abilities, with eye gaze performance, including time course and spatial displacement, comparable to neurotypical controls. In contrast, the same mvASD individuals averaged only 57% accuracy when asked to point to the target, revealing a significant gap between reporting via pointing and actual lexical-semantic knowledge. Furthermore, pupil dilation analysis during tasks indicated reduced arousal recruitment in mvASD participants, potentially implicating dysregulation of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system associated with the performance gap between pointing and eye-gaze. These findings challenge assumptions of global intellectual limitation while confirming specific lexical-semantic competence among mvASD individuals. Results highlight the need for- and provide alternative- assessments that bypass manual motor responses. The CLP shows promise for revealing cognitive and language abilities, with important implications for both research and education.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

    "content": "Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications. Our hybrid gesture dataset and source codes are available on Github.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site.

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

    "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

    "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "title": "Learning-dependent cholinergic plasticity reconfigures cortical circuit dynamics.",
    "content": "Neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) plays a critical role in reshaping neural dynamics in the neocortex as a function of development, behavioral state, and learning 1-6. Prior work suggests cholinergic signaling can act as a gate for the subsequent induction of circuit plasticity 3,7,8. However, modification of ACh release could also be a direct mechanism for the expression of cortical plasticity. Here, we combine widefield and 2-photon imaging in head-fixed mice to show that visual fear conditioning leads to a selective, cue-dependent release of ACh in primary visual cortex that enhances visually-evoked neuronal responses via excitation of layer 1 GABAergic interneurons and resulting disinhibition of local excitatory pyramidal neurons. Cholinergic signaling through muscarinic receptors in visual cortex is necessary for both the enhanced visual response and conditioned fear behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel capacity for conditioned release of ACh in sensory cortex to serve as a mechanism for sensory-guided behavioral learning. Rather than acting as a simple gate, cortical neuromodulation may thus play a central role in the expression of learned behavior.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Spatial separation enhances speech intelligibility but increases listening effort with session-dependent variability in pupillometric measures",
    "content": "IntroductionThe current understanding of the cognitive load of listening effort has been advanced by combining speech intelligibility and pupillometry measures. However, the reliability of pupil dilation metrics in complex listening scenarios like spatial release from masking (SRM) remains uncertain. This study investigated how spatial separation of sound sources impacts listening effort (via peak pupil dilation, PPD) and speech intelligibility.MethodsSpeech intelligibility and listening effort were simultaneously measured under co-located and symmetric, spatially-separated conditions at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).ResultsResults showed that although spatial separation improved speech intelligibility, it did not yield a corresponding reduction in listening effort. Instead, listening effort increased as SNR became more challenging. Furthermore, test\u2013retest reliability was moderate-to-high for speech intelligibility but only moderate-to-low for PPD, with greater consistency observed at more challenging SNRs. These results suggest that obtaining stable PPD measures within an SRM paradigm may be difficult to achieve.DiscussionThese findings indicate that obtaining stable PPD measures within an SRM paradigm can be challenging. Test session reliability is weak when combining SRM paradigms with measures of listening effort, which may reduce statistical power due to factors such as sample size, number of trials, and sessions tested. This is further limited by the relatively small and homogeneous sample of young, typical hearing adults. Future studies should include a larger and more diverse participant group to assess the generalizability of these results.Clinical trial registrationThe study was registered on September 21, 2024, with the identifier number NCT02532972.",

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Parsing auditory neural code into maximum-entropy packets",
    "content": "Deciphering the neural code requires identifying its fundamental symbols or codewords. Neural activity is usually interpreted either as a rate code - based on average spike counts - or as a temporal code, which distinguishes patterns with identical counts. Yet, the symbols of the code remain undefined. Here we show that the symbols can be clearly defined by parsing auditory spike trains into variable-duration \"packets\", within which precise spike timing is irrelevant. Because packets vary in duration, this is not a rate code. A single neuron could encode very different stimuli depending on the number of spikes it produced per packet. The packet-based code enables real-time readout upon packet completion due to its instantaneous code structure and maximizes information capacity at both single-neuron and population levels.",

    "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
    "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

    "content": "BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. In that context, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Furthermore, alterations in parietal memory network (PMN) integrity and default mode network (DMN) also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that might interfere with cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson\u2019s disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC or LPC separately.MethodsThis is a randomized and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS in 120 patients (60 aMCI and 60 PD-MCI). Firstly, all patients will be randomly (1:1) divided into two groups: DLPFC (30 aMCI; 30 PD-MCI) and LPC (30 aMCI, 30 PD-MCI) for tDCS stimulation. Secondly, they will classify randomly (2:1) real and sham groups for tDCS applied to once a day for 10 days over 2 weeks. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2-mA current frequency and will last 20\u202fmin. The primary outcome assessment for this study will be the change in score from baseline to the end of (14-days and 90\u202fdays follow-up) the tDCS application for the neurocognitive tests. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the neural underpinnings and pro-cognitive outcomes of tDCS.

    "content": "IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as various acupoints, on human autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and physical stress. The research further to identify effective intervention strategies for stress management and health maintenance.MethodsA Self-comparison design was conducted with healthy volunteers. Thirty-five volunteers received sequential 15-min interventions of moxibustion at ST36, acupuncture at CV12, and acupuncture at ST36, with a one-day washout period between interventions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured to assess autonomic function, and heart rate (HR) and the physical stress index (PSI) were measured to assess stress levels.ResultsCompared with the baseline, acupuncture at ST36 increased the high-frequency power (HF), root mean square of the successive interval difference (RMSSD), instantaneous standard deviation of the R\u2013R interval (SD1), long-term standard deviation of the R\u2013R intervals (SD2), total power (TP), and standard deviation of the normal\u2013normal interval (SDNN). Acupuncture at CV12 increased RMSSD, SD1, SD2, TP and SDNN, with sustained effects for RMSSD and SD1 post-acupuncture, SD1/SD2 were increased post-acupuncture. The HRs of all three interventions decreased during the intervention, and remained sustained effects post-intervention. The PSI decreased during acupuncture and the stimulation at CV12 remained sustained effects post-acupuncture.ConclusionAcupuncture alleviates physical stress by regulating ANS activity, with distinct modulatory effects observed across different acupoints, indicating potential applications in stress management and health maintenance.

    "title": "Unexpected words that become your best memories: How sentential constraint and word expectedness affect memory retrieval",
    "content": "Much is known about how the strength of contextual support from strongly constraining (SC) and weakly constraining (WC) sentences influences the online processing of expected (EXP) and unexpected (UNEXP) sentence-ending words. In the present study, we investigated the long-term mnemonic consequences associated with the processing of contextually constraint words and used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the memory retrieval mechanisms at work. Furthermore, we investigated false memories for expected but unpresented words. If these unpresented words remained highly accessible in memory, their false recognition as familiar would manifest in a larger early frontal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of episodic familiarity. Behavioral results indicated that strongly expected and highly unexpected words were more likely to be recognized, whereas memory for moderately expected words was attenuated. However, the anticipated early frontal old/new effects in these conditions did not materialize. Instead, the retrieval of highly unexpected (SC-UNEXP) words was characterized by a late parietal old/new effect, reflecting a reliance on recollection-based processes. Unexpectedly, during retrieval SC-UNEXP words also evoked a late frontal positivity, a pattern usually associated with the inhibition of unpresented expected words during encoding. This suggests that the retrieval of these words reactivated inhibitory mechanisms akin to those activated during encoding. Additionally, expected lures that were correctly identified as new elicited a broadly distributed positive slow wave, indicative of recollective processing in support of a recall-to-reject strategy. This latter effect was observed irrespective of the predictive strength of the contextual support.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

For several decades, conventional ventilation (CV) has been widely used to manage pulmonary dysfunction. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may prove to be more effective than CV in these infants. However, with recent innovations in CV, it remains unclear whether HFOV is more effective than CV in term or near-term infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction. This is an update of a...",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish... The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. Life, life, life. Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "content": "Action understanding requires internal models that link vision to motor goals. In monkeys, mirror neurons demonstrate motor resonance during observation, but single-unit evidence in humans is limited, leaving open whether such representations rely solely on motor resonance. We recorded neural activity from motor cortex (MC) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) in two tetraplegic participants implanted with Utah arrays while they intended or observed hand actions. MC strongly encoded intention but showed only weak, feature-specific overlap during observation, evident primarily at the population level. SPL, in contrast, supported shared models across intended movement and observation formats at both single-unit and population levels. In variants with incongruent instructed and observed actions, SPL encoded observed actions only when behaviorally relevant, whereas MC remained intention-dominant. Our results identify a context-dependent gating mechanism in SPL and suggest a hierarchical organization in which MC maintains intention-specific codes while SPL flexibly links observed input with internal goals to support action understanding.",

    "title": "Prefrontal cortex and striatum dissociate modality and learning order in cross-modal sensorimotor learning",
    "content": "Sensorimotor learning is accompanied by the emergence and strengthening of sensory responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. However, it remains unclear whether learning-evoked sensory responses in these structures are modality-specific, or whether they represent a more generalized signal for modality-independent but behaviorally relevant stimuli. To address this question, we performed widefield calcium imaging while mice were trained on sensorimotor tasks involving either visual or auditory stimuli, with mice first learning one modality and then switching to the other. We found that the anterior PFC (aPFC) exhibited a bilateral response to both visual and auditory stimuli after learning the respective tasks, indicating a generalized sensory representation. In contrast, the medial PFC (mPFC) showed modality-specific activity, responding only to contralateral visual stimuli after learning. Mice were able to learn sensorimotor associations for both modalities in sequence, and were only able to transfer learned behavior from visual to auditory stimuli but not the reverse. Despite differences in cross-modal learning transfer, cortical responses to learned stimuli were the same regardless of learning order. In contrast, electrophysiological recordings in the anterior striatum revealed that visually responsive regions became co-responsive to auditory stimuli only in mice trained on the visual task first. The additional auditory responses arose from distinct neurons rather than those previously responsive to visual stimuli, indicating that co-responsiveness occurred at the regional rather than single-neuron level. Together, these findings reveal that learned sensory responses in the PFC and striatum uniquely dissociate modality and learning order, suggesting a divergence in their roles during sensorimotor learning.",

    "content": "The landmark ongoing HEALthy Brain and Cognitive Development (HBCD) study will longitudinally chart brain development in a large sample (projected n=7,200) of infants through age 10 years with multimodal neuroimaging that includes an advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisition. Here, we detail advances in dMRI image processing developed for HBCD, incorporated into the widely used QSIPrep pipeline. Major changes to preprocessing include improvements in infant brain extraction, distortion correction, and normalization to infant-specific templates. Additionally, we describe a new software package - QSIRecon - that yields rich derived data including diverse maps of tissue microstructure as well as person-specific white matter bundles. Using dMRI data from a subset of the HBCD 1.0 release where age information was available (n=529 sessions across two time points), we observe critical improvements in data quality with preprocessing and see expected developmental patterns. Moving forward, the publicly-available data from HBCD will rapidly grow to become the largest study of brain development in infancy and early childhood using dMRI. QSIPrep and QSIRecon are openly available and can be applied to other infant and pediatric dMRI datasets.",

    "title": "Proteomic profile of hippocampal growth cones through early postnatal development",
    "content": "The early postnatal period represents a critical window for neural circuit assembly in the developing hippocampus. Growth cones (GCs) play essential roles in establishing connectivity patterns, yet their proteomic composition during this dynamic developmental phase remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed comprehensive proteomic profiling of GCs isolated from the whole hippocampus (HP-GCs) and dentate gyrus (DG-GCs) across the first five postnatal days (P1, P3, P5) in mice. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis revealed that GCs from both regions are highly similar at P1, subsequently diverging. This earliest timepoint seems to be characterized by a high metabolic demand. Developmental trajectories of the GCs from the two subregions then start to differ, with P3 being a very dynamic period for HP-GCs, with GO terms related to RNA splicing, and a transition towards synapse formation by P5. On the contrary, DG-GCs seem to still be in an exploratory phase by P5, suggesting a delayed maturation and reflecting the later time course of the invasion of EC layer 2 Reelin-positive axons into this region. We identified over 5,000 proteins, with each timepoint characterized by distinct protein subsets. Temporal trajectory analysis revealed key GC markers including DCC, DPSYL2, and FABP7, which showed dynamic regulation across development. Notably, we identified multiple proteins containing nuclear localization sequences, suggesting bidirectional communication between GCs and the nucleus during critical developmental periods. Furthermore, our dataset contains over 400 proteins associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with twenty showing temporal regulation, highlighting the potential relevance of early developmental disruptions to disease pathogenesis. These findings provide a comprehensive proteomic resource for understanding GC function during hippocampal circuit formation and offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying region-specific developmental timelines in the brain.",

    "title": "A lobule-specific neuronal representation of song temporal structure in the songbird cerebellum",
    "content": "The cerebellum is involved in the acquisition and production of speech as revealed by clinical evidence and imaging studies, but its specific role however remains unclear. Songbirds provide a unique model to study the neural mechanisms of speech learning and production. Recent evidence highlights a contribution of the cerebellum to syllable duration in songbirds. Here, we aim at better understanding how and which cerebellar circuits may contribute to the tight control of syllable duration in zebra finches. We first confirmed that lesions in the lateral cerebellum affect syllable duration. We then recorded neuronal activity in the various cerebellar lobules in response to song playback and during singing with or without auditory feedback perturbation. We found that many cerebellar lobules receive non-selective auditory information locked to syllable boundaries during song playback, both in anaesthetized and awake behaving birds. During singing, cerebellar neurons in several lobules display song-locked responses with varying degrees of alignment to their playback responses and no alteration during auditory feedback perturbation. Singing-related activity tends to correlate with the fluctuations in syllable duration rather than any acoustic song feature. Importantly, neurons in lobule IV of the cerebellum are largely unaffected by auditory stimulation but display syllable-locked firing rate modulations during singing that precisely encode syllable boundaries with a sharp and tight increase in firing at syllable onsets and offsets. Altogether, our findings reveal cerebellar signals that may contribute to the control of the duration of vocal elements during singing, possibly serving as a forward model of song temporal features.",

    "title": "Theta Activity Supports Landmark-Based Correction of Naturalistic Human Path Integration",
    "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

    "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1\u20135) and cognitive processes (clusters 6\u20139), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.",

    "content": "As higher education increasingly transitions to online platforms such as Zoom, understanding the mechanisms that underlie effective virtual collaboration has become essential. Prior research has shown that relational quality, trust, and communication strongly influence online collaborative learning; however, the real-time cognitive and affective dynamics underpinning these interactions are yet to be elucidated. This study addresses this gap by examining inter-brain synchrony (IBS)\u2014the alignment of neural activity between individuals\u2014as an indicator of collaborative success. Using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we investigated IBS in 30 dyads of undergraduate students engaged in a naturalistic three-phase Zoom seminar comprising lecture viewing, interactive discussion, and a presentation. Inter-brain synchrony between partners was computed in the prefrontal cortex, and outcomes were assessed via relational satisfaction questionnaires and standardized ratings of presentations. Results showed that IBS emerged predominantly during active discussions, but not during passive lecture viewing, underscoring the importance of interactive engagement in generating neural alignment. Crucially, higher IBS during discussion predicted both greater group relational satisfaction and improved task performance. These findings extend prior evidence that IBS supports cooperation, demonstrating that neural synchrony can occur even without physical co-presence and is associated with both performance and satisfaction in virtual educational settings.",

    "content": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in the complex pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, a leading cause of global death and disability. This review synthesizes current understanding of the core ferroptosis pathways, including iron dysregulation, glutathione depletion, and GPX4 inactivation and distinguishes it from other cell death modalities. We critically explore its role as a pathogenic amplifier in stroke, synergizing with neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction to expand neuronal injury. The review systematically assesses therapeutic strategies, from iron chelators and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (e.g., ferrostatin-1) to emerging gene therapies and nanomedicine-based approaches, based on robust preclinical evidence. However, translating these findings faces challenges, including a narrow therapeutic window, patient heterogeneity, and the need to balance efficacy with safety concerning systemic iron and lipid metabolism. To overcome these translational challenges, future research must prioritize the discovery of clinical biomarkers (e.g., FABP5) and the development of targeted delivery systems to advance ferroptosis-directed therapies for stroke.",

    "title": "Expression of dementia biomarkers in Appalachian and non-Appalachian ELVO patients during thrombectomy",
    "content": "Background/ContextVascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) affects 25-30% of stroke patients and includes cognitive impairments caused by vascular injury, such as post-stroke dementia. Rehabilitation has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients at risk of developing dementia. However, there is currently no reliable method to identify those at risk of dementia after a stroke. Several biomarkers, including ADRD (Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias) biomarkers (Ab, tau, NfL, and GFAP) and angiogenic factors (VEGF, Flt-1, Tie-2, PIGF, and FGF) have been associated with the development of dementia.Populations in Appalachia experience a higher incidence of stroke and related mortality compared to other groups. Given the elevated stroke rates in Appalachian communities, this study aims to investigate potential proteomic differences between patients from Appalachian and non-Appalachian counties. The primary goal of the study is to characterize the expression of post-stroke cognitive dementia biomarkers and to explore differences in the proteomic profiles of Appalachian and non-Appalachian populations.Methods/ApproachSample Collection: The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry Collaborative (BACTRAC) protocol, established by Fraser and colleagues, introduces a novel method for analyzing stroke by collecting intracranial blood samples from patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. During the procedure the thrombus and blood samples from areas distal and proximal to the thrombus are collected and undergo proteomic analysis (Fraser et al.). Additional demographic and clinical information are collected from electronic health records. The control data was obtained from arterial blood collected during diagnostic angiograms from patients with cerebrovascular disease.Data AnalysisPropensity score models were used to perform a one-to-one match between stroke and control patients on age, sex, BMI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia resulting in groups that were balanced on these measured prognostic characteristics. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was then used to assess differences in the 12 ADRD biomarkers.ResultsCompared to the controls, stroke patients had significantly higher levels of GFAP. The control patients had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. In the Appalachian patient population, the control patients also had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. Additionally, the Appalachian stroke patients had higher GFAP. In the non-Appalachian population only GFAP was significantly different between stroke and control groups, with it being elevated in the stroke group.ConclusionThere was a notable difference in the levels of certain ADRD biomarkers between stroke patients and control patients. Specifically, in Appalachian populations, stroke patients showed significant differences in multiple ADRD biomarkers (AB40, AB42, and GFAP) compared to controls, a pattern not seen in non-Appalachian stroke patients, where only GFAP levels increased. This difference in ADRD biomarkers observed in Appalachian stroke patients could be attributed to a combination of socioeconomic and environmental factors unique to the Appalachian region.",

    "content": "IntroductionEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain, posing a persistent challenge in clinical diagnosis. This study presents a high-performance epileptic seizure detection framework that integrates advanced feature extraction and classification techniques using EEG signals.MethodsWe conduct experiments on the Bonn and CHB-MIT EEG datasets. The EEG signals are preprocessed through bandpass filtering and five-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition. From each sub-band, four representative features are systematically extracted. To mitigate severe class imbalance, we propose a two-stage balancing strategy: cluster centroid-based under-sampling initially reduces the interictal-to-ictal ratio to 2:1, followed by Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BLSMOTE) in the feature space. A hybrid classification model that combines Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed in the paper. The encoder weights from the pre-trained CSAE are transferred to the GRU-based classifier to enhance feature representation and model generalization.ResultsThe proposed method achieves outstanding performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1 score and AUC of 98.46, 98.27, 98.50, 98.36, 98.31, and 98.23% on the Bonn dataset, and 99.49, 99.21, 99.77, 99.49, 99.35, and 99.57% on the CHB-MIT dataset, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.DiscussionThis study introduces a novel framework combining cluster centroid-based under-sampling, BLSMOTE oversampling, and transfer learning via CSAE-GRU integration. The method offers a promising direction for reliable and clinically applicable automated epilepsy diagnosis.",

    "title": "Changes in muscle activation and joint motion during walking after transtibial amputation with sensory feedback from spinal cord stimulation: a case study",
    "content": "Objective. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activity during walking after lower-limb amputation. Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation. Approach. This case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 d. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity and knee and ankle joint angles. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early (Day 30) and late (Day 63) time points across the implant duration. Main results. During walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal. Significance. Restoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS altered muscle activity during walking led to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.",

Although significant progress has been made by combining deep learning with SPI, traditional imaging schemes remain limited by low coding resolution, resulting in inefficiency and imaging quality bottlenecks. To address these problems, we propose a parallel single-pixel imaging framework based on array spatial light fields. The framework rearranges the same...",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "content": "This study examines the relationship between employment status and dream content using a data set of 6,478 dream reports collected from Reddit. We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

HL-AI gives people practical, moment-to-moment control without requiring platform cooperation. We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.",

While generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are increasingly used for idea generation, designers often struggle to craft effective prompts and find it difficult to express evolving visual concepts through text alone. In the formative study (N=6), we examined how designers use GenAI during ideation, revealing that text-based prompting disrupts creative flow. To address these issues, we developed TalkSketch, an embedded multimodal AI sketching system that integrates freehand drawing with real-time speech input. TalkSketch aims to support a more fluid ideation process through capturing verbal descriptions during sketching and generating context-aware AI responses. Our work highlights the potential of GenAI tools to engage the design process itself rather than focusing on output.",

We conducted a participatory study with youth, parents, and youth care workers (N=38), using co-created youth personas as scaffolds, to elicit community perspectives on how LLMs can facilitate more meaningful personalization to support youth mental well-being. Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate how lived experience can be operationalized to inform design features in LLMs, which can enhance the alignment of LLM-based interventions with the realities of youth and their communities, contributing to more effectively personalized digital well-being tools.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05744v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conditionally automated driving requires drivers to resume vehicle control promptly when automation reaches its operational limits. Ensuring smooth vehicle control transitions is critical for the safety and efficiency of mixed-traffic transportation systems, where complex interactions and variable traffic behaviors pose additional challenges. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an adaptive time budget framework that provides drivers with sufficient time to complete takeovers both safely and comfortably across diverse scenarios. We focus in particular on the takeover buffer, that is, the extra time available after drivers consciously resume control to complete evasive maneuvers. A driving simulator experiment is conducted to evaluate the influence of different takeover buffer lengths on safety-related indicators (minimum time-to-collision, maximum deceleration, and steering wheel angle) and subjective assessments (perceived time sufficiency, perceived risk, and performance satisfaction). Results show that (i) takeover buffers of about 5-6 seconds consistently lead to optimal safety and comfort; and (ii) drivers prefer relatively stable takeover buffers across varying traffic densities and n-back tasks. This study introduces an adaptive time budget framework that dynamically allocates transition time by incorporating a predicted takeover time and a preferred takeover buffer (piecewise function). This can serve as an important first step toward providing drivers with sufficient time to resume vehicle control across diverse scenarios, which needs to be validated in more diverse and real-world driving contexts. By aligning the provided time budget with driver needs under specific circumstances, the adaptive framework can improve reliability of control transitions, facilitate human-centered automated driving, reduce crash risk, and maintain overall traffic efficiency.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05737v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates how student exposure to resources in their home environments relates to creative thinking performance, using data from the PISA 2022 Creative Thinking assessment. It focuses on two primary questions: (1) How strongly is exposure to cultural, educational, and digital resources associated with creativity? (2) Do students perform better on divergent thinking tasks when physically engaged or digitally stimulated? Drawing on a sample of 15,425 students from 60 countries, the study applies high-dimensional regression and factor analysis to identify patterns across a wide range of exposure variables. To model the latent structure of home environment variables, we conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The analysis specified two latent factors: Physical Exposure and Digital Exposure. The model demonstrated excellent fit, with a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.971 and a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.038. When both factors were entered together in the regression, physical and digital exposures each contributed unique explanatory power. There is no indication that one simply proxies the other; rather, they appear to be complementary dimensions of a creative home environment. This study offers compelling international evidence that both physical and digital resources in the home environment play significant, independent, and complementary roles in shaping adolescent creative thinking abilities. These findings have direct implications for efforts to promote creativity and equity in education.",

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities to enhance the advising process. We present AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system that automates time-consuming tasks, such as information retrieval and response drafting, while preserving human oversight. AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility. Our evaluation shows that AdvisingWise produces accurate, personalized responses. Advisors reported increasingly positive perceptions after using AdvisingWise, as their initial concerns about reliability and personalization diminished. We conclude by discussing the implications of human-AI synergy on the practice of academic advising.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05699v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how humans attribute beliefs, goals, and intentions to others, known as theory of mind (ToM), is critical in the context of human-computer interaction. Despite various metrics used to assess ToM, the interplay between cognitive, spatial, and emotional factors in influencing human decision making during adversarial interactions remains underexplored. This paper investigates these relationships using the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game as a testbed. Through established ToM tests, we analyze how cognitive reasoning, spatial awareness, and emotional perceptiveness affect human performance when interacting with bots and human opponents in repeated RPS settings. Our findings reveal significant correlations among certain ToM metrics and highlight humans' ability to detect patterns in opponents' actions. However, most individual ToM metrics proved insufficient for predicting performance variations, with recursive thinking being the only metric moderately associated with decision effectiveness. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), we identified two latent factors influencing decision effectiveness: Factor 1, characterized by recursive thinking, emotional perceptiveness, and spatial reasoning, positively affects decision-making against dynamic bots and human players, while Factor 2, linked to interpersonal skills and rational ability, has a negative impact. These insights lay the groundwork for further research on ToM metrics and for designing more intuitive, adaptive systems that better anticipate and adapt to human behavior, ultimately enhancing human-machine collaboration.",

Discord has emerged as a popular communication platform in academic settings, offering a combination of messaging and support for chatbot development. However, most existing Discord bots lack specialized educational functionalities and mobile-friendly interfaces, limiting their effectiveness for instructional use. This paper presents InsightEdu, an innovative iOS application that provides a touch-centric interface for managing a custom Discord bot designed for educational contexts. The system enables educators to conduct surveys, collect feedback, and track attendance through an intuitive mobile interface. The architecture combines a SwiftUI-based iOS client application with a Python-based Discord bot server. User evaluation with educators demonstrated significant usability improvements compared to traditional Discord interfaces, with 92% of participants (n = 20) reporting enhanced efficiency in managing educational interactions. This study demonstrates that mobile-first, instructor-friendly design can significantly enhance the utility of existing communication platforms for academic purposes.",

ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social interaction) is an encountered-type haptic display that integrates a torque-controlled manipulator and interchangeable props with a VR headset to enable three gestures: object handovers, fist bumps, and high fives. We conducted a user study to examine how ETHOS adds physicality to virtual character interactions and how this affects presence, realism, enjoyment, and connection metrics. Each participant experienced one interaction under three conditions: no physicality (NP), static physicality (SP), and dynamic physicality (DP). SP extended the purely virtual baseline (NP) by introducing tangible props for direct contact, while DP further incorporated motion and impact forces to emulate natural touch. Results show presence increased stepwise from NP to SP to DP. Realism, enjoyment, and connection also improved with added physicality, though differences between SP and DP were not significant. Comfort remained consistent across conditions, indicating no added psychological friction. These findings demonstrate the experiential value of ETHOS and motivate the integration of encountered-type haptics into socially meaningful VR experiences.",

    "content": "<p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<sub>2P</sub> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness.

    "content": "<p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>",

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>",

    "title": "Learning to Program \"Recycles\" Preexisting Frontoparietal Population Codes of Logical Algorithms",
    "content": "<p>Computer programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet little is known about how the human brain enables this recently invented cultural skill. According to the neural recycling hypothesis, cultural skills (e.g., reading, math) repurpose preexisting neural \"information maps.\" Alternatively, such maps could emerge de novo during learning, as they do in artificial neural networks. Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get \"recycled\"? College students (<i>n</i> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction. Programming recycles preexisting representations of logical algorithms in frontoparietal cortices, supporting the recycling framework of cultural skill acquisition.</p>",

    "title": "Reduction in Reward-Driven Behavior Depends on the Basolateral But Not Central Nucleus of the Amygdala in Female Rats",
    "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior depends on a dynamic balance between acquisition and extinction memories. Male and female rodents differ in extinction learning rates, suggesting potential sex-based differences in this balance. In males, deletion of extinction-recruited neurons in the central nucleus (CN) of the amygdala impairs extinction retrieval, shifting behavior toward acquisition (Lay et al., 2023). Here, we tested whether this mechanism also operates in females. In contrast to previously reported findings in males, deleting extinction-recruited CN neurons after single or extended extinction training had no effect on extinction retrieval in female rats. This lack of behavioral impact was not due to sex differences in CN activation during extinction. However, during early extinction, females showed greater activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) than males. Deletion of this BLA ensemble produced a more substantial reduction in conditioned approach than in non-deletion controls. These findings uncover a potential interplay between the CN and BLA in regulating conditioned approach in females. While ablation of extinction-recruited CN neurons do not modulate extinction retrieval in females, targeted BLA neuronal ablation during early extinction shifts behavior toward low, extinction-level responding. Thus heightened BLA activation during early extinction may prevent the emergence of extinction-like behavior in females. These findings, taken together with those reported by Lay et al. (2023), offer new insights into potential sex-based differences in the neural mechanisms underlying extinction and may inform the development of sex-based treatments for cue-triggered appetitive behaviors.</p>",

    "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads.

    "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface.

    "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
    "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

    "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series.

Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

    "title": "Real-time distance monitoring in magnetomyography",
    "content": "Objective. Magnetomyography (MMG) using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) offers a contactless, non-invasive approach to assess muscle activity. However, fluctuations in the sensor-to-source distance during MMG recordings pose a significant challenge to accurate signal interpretation since amplitude decays with distance. No established method exists for MMG to continuously monitor sensor-to-source distance changes in real-time. Approach. This study presents a new non-magnetic, cost-effective solution using a digital fiber optic sensor to continuously measure the distance between an OPM and the subject\u2019s skin. Following sensor calibration, distance measurements were recorded during an isometric muscle fatigue task in five healthy participants to assess whether MMG amplitude changes were due to physiological effects or variations in sensor-to-source distance. Alongside OPM-MMG and distance tracking, electromyography (EMG), the neurophysiological gold standard, was simultaneously recorded. Main results. We found significant changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue that were not merely explained by changes in sensor-to-source distance. Furthermore, we found substantial correlations between OPM-MMG and EMG that were strongest for small sensor-to-source distance (r = 0.91). Significance. Fiber optic sensors offer non-magnetic, precise, real-time monitoring of the distance between the OPM and the skin, making it ideal for MMG applications to account for distance-related variability during measurements. Our results suggest that changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue reflect genuine physiological effects rather than distance confounds.",

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Towards Ecologically Valid LLM Benchmarks: Understanding and Designing Domain-Centered Evaluations for Journalism Practitioners",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.05501v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Benchmarks play a significant role in how researchers and the public understand generative AI systems. However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals. Our workshop findings surface specific challenges that inform benchmark design opportunities, which we instantiate in a case study that addresses underlying criticisms and specific domain concerns. Through our findings and design case study, this work provides design guidance for developing benchmarks that are better tuned to specific domains.",

    "title": "AI-Enhanced High-Density NIRS Patch for Real-Time Brain Layer Oxygenation Monitoring in Neurological Emergencies",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.05612v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.",

To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05548v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current neuroimaging studies on neurodegenerative diseases and psychological risk factors have been developed predominantly in non Hispanic White cohorts, with other populations markedly underrepresented. In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.",

    "title": "ConnectomeBench: Can LLMs Proofread the Connectome?",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.05542v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05536v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.",

The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.",

Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\\tau \\subsetneq \\sigma$ for which $|\\tau| = i$ and $|\\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05505v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.",

Standard models implicitly assume there is no need for a finer-level search within the 1-degree foveola, as stimuli falling in this region are already viewed at high resolution. Using state-of-the-art high-precision eye tracking with arcminute level accuracy to localize the line of sight, we show that the visuomotor system is capable of implementing effective visual search strategies with striking precision within the foveated region. This active behavior, mediated by microsaccades, tiny saccades just a few arcminutes in size, allows for an efficient examination of the details falling in the central fovea. Our findings challenge the traditional visual search view and reveal that at each fixation a finer priority map of the foveal input is established, underscoring the dynamic nature of these representations.",

    "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "content": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is an umbrella term for movement, motor, and posture disorders that occur in the developing brain from any non-progressive cause. Action observation therapy (AOT) is a method used in the treatment of motor disorders. Here, the manuscript presents the study protocol for the effect of AOT on balance using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This study protocol aims to comprehensively evaluate the impact of AOT in patients with CP regarding brain activation and...",
