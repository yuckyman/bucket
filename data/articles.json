These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

    "title": "CLaI: Collaborative Learning and Inference for Low-Resolution Physiological Signals: Validation in Clinical Event Detection and Prediction",
    "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

    "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

    "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

    "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
    "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24070v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in children's learning spaces, families face new challenges in guiding its use. Middle childhood (ages 7-13) is a critical stage where children seek autonomy even as parental influence remains strong. Using self-directed learning (SDL) as a lens, we examine how parents perceive and support children's developing AI literacy through focus groups with 13 parent-child pairs. Parents described evolving phases of engagement driven by screen time, self-motivation, and growing knowledge. While many framed AI primarily as a study tool, few considered its non-educational roles or risks, such as privacy and infrastructural embedding. Parents also noted gaps in their own AI understanding, often turning to joint exploration and engagement as a form of co-learning. Our findings reveal how families co-construct children's AI literacy, exposing tensions between practical expectations and critical literacies, and provide design implications that foster SDL while balancing autonomy and oversight.",

    "title": "VR-Assisted Guide Dog Training: A 360{\\deg} PanoHaptic System for Right-Hand Commands Analysis",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.24057v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a VR-based guide dog training system designed to assist novice trainers in understanding guide dog behavior and issuing appropriate training commands. Guide dogs play a vital role in supporting independent mobility for visually impaired individuals, yet the limited number of skilled trainers restricts their availability. Training is highly demanding, requiring accurate observation of the dog's status and precise command issuance, especially through right-hand gestures. While the trainer's left hand holds the harness to perceive haptic cues, the right hand is used to indicate directions, maintain attention, and provide comfort, with motion patterns varying by scenario and the dog's progress. Currently, novices learn mainly by observing experts or watching videos, which lacks immersion and makes it difficult to adopt the trainer's perspective for understanding behavior or synchronizing command timing.\n  To address these limitations, the proposed system introduces a VR-based assistive platform integrating panoramic visuals and haptic feedback to create an immersive training environment. The visual module provides contextual guidance, including cues for command execution and real-time comparison of the user's posture with standard actions, while the haptic module delivers tactile feedback for command gestures. Users can re-experience training sessions across diverse scenarios and dog proficiency levels, allowing independent and repeated practice. By improving the timing, accuracy, and expressiveness of right-hand commands, the system aims to accelerate skill acquisition, enhance training quality, and mitigate the shortage of qualified trainers, ultimately increasing the availability of guide dogs for visually impaired individuals.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24011v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI writing support becomes ubiquitous, how disclosing its use affects reader perception remains a critical, underexplored question. We conducted a study with 261 participants to examine how revealing varying levels of AI involvement shifts author impressions across six distinct communicative acts. Our analysis of 990 responses shows that disclosure generally erodes perceptions of trustworthiness, caring, competence, and likability, with the sharpest declines in social and interpersonal writing. A thematic analysis of participants' feedback links these negative shifts to a perceived loss of human sincerity, diminished author effort, and the contextual inappropriateness of AI. Conversely, we find that higher AI literacy mitigates these negative perceptions, leading to greater tolerance or even appreciation for AI use. Our results highlight the nuanced social dynamics of AI-mediated authorship and inform design implications for creating transparent, context-sensitive writing systems that better preserve trust and authenticity.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24004v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study attention in mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using object recall as a proxy outcome. We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers. PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability, cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers. The model outputs per-object recall probabilities that can drive interface adjustments when predicted recall falls. Overall, PLS-SEM provides competitive accuracy with interpretable levers for design and evaluation in mobile AR.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.23887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Speech sound disorder is among the most common communication challenges in preschool children. Home-based practice is essential for effective therapy and for acquiring generalization of target sounds, yet sustaining engaging and consistent practice remains difficult. Existing story-based activities, despite their potential for sound generalization and educational benefits, are often underutilized due to limited interactivity. Moreover, many practice tools fail to sufficiently integrate speech--language pathologists into the process, resulting in weak alignment with clinical treatment plans. To address these limitations, we present MORA, an interactive story-based practice system. MORA introduces three key innovations. First, it embeds target sounds and vocabulary into dynamic, character-driven conversational narratives, requiring children to actively produce speech to progress the story, thereby creating natural opportunities for exposure, repetition, and generalization. Second, it provides visual cues, explicit instruction, and feedback, allowing children to practice effectively either independently or with caregivers. Third, it supports an AI-in-the-loop workflow, enabling SLPs to configure target materials, review logged speech with phoneme-level scoring, and adapt therapy plans asynchronously -- bridging the gap between clinic and home practice while respecting professional expertise. A formative study with six licensed SLPs informed the system's design rationale, and an expert review with seven SLPs demonstrated strong alignment with established articulation-based treatments, as well as potential to enhance children's engagement and literacy. Furthermore, discussions highlight the design considerations for professional support and configurability, adaptive and multimodal child interaction, while highlighting MORA's broader applicability across speech and language disorders.",

Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high- amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.",

    "content": "arXiv:2506.04536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

    "content": "arXiv:2502.21142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.24709v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.",

    "title": "Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.24029v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.\n  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.",

    "content": "Intracranial electrical stimulation is foundational in neuroscience and clinical neuromodulation, yet how applied electrical fields engage neural tissue and influences perception remains unclear. Using three orthogonal Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we recorded extracellular voltages and spikes with sub-millisecond resolution in three dimensions around a stimulation source. The evoked potential extended asymmetrically and grew sub-linearly with amplitude, influenced by anatomical heterogeneity. Increasing amplitude increased the density, but not spatial extent, of directly responsive neurons, but fewer than 5% of neurons within the evoked potential were activated. Fast-spiking interneurons were recruited nearer the source, whereas pyramidal neurons showed anisotropic activation. Direct responses were polarity- and amplitude-selective. Sparse direct spiking drove large, asymmetric cortical responses and modulated >50% of neurons at higher amplitudes. Perceptually, mice weakly detected single pulses, and performance did not improve with amplitude. Thus, anatomy and spatiotemporal patterning - not spike counts - govern physiological and perceptual impact, informing biomimetic, multi-contact prostheses.",

    "title": "ADHD-like traits reshape the balance between inhibitory control and predictive processes",
    "content": "Adaptive behavior relies on a dynamic balance between flexible, goal-directed control and efficient, automatic processes. This equilibrium is often disrupted in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition understood to exist along a continuum of traits in the general population. While ADHD is consistently linked to response inhibition deficits, its relationship with statistical learning (a mechanism for habit learning) and, crucially, the interaction between these functions, remains underexplored. Here, using a novel paradigm in a non-clinical sample of university students (n = 226), we investigated how ADHD-like traits modulate the interplay between response inhibition and statistical learning. We found that higher ADHD-like traits were associated with poorer response inhibition, confirming previous research. Importantly, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between inhibition and statistical learning, where weaker inhibitory control typically led to enhanced learning of environmental regularities. However, this learning advantage progressively diminished across the ADHD trait continuum, becoming markedly reduced in individuals with high symptom prevalence. These findings provide novel evidence that ADHD-like traits influence not only isolated neurocognitive processes but also their dynamic interaction, highlighting a spectrum-based mechanism that may underlie the transition from adaptive variability to maladaptive behavioral patterns. This work advocates for a dimensional approach to ADHD, emphasizing early detection and targeted interventions for individuals with varying levels of symptomatic expression, broadening support beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries.",

    "content": "In social species, the ability to recognize others emotional states is essential for appropriate social interactions, yet it often declines with age and is impaired in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. While emotion recognition has been characterized in both humans and rodents, the underlying neural circuits and how they vary by sex and age remain poorly understood. Here, we used a negative Emotional state Discrimination Task (EDT) in TRAP2 transgenic mice to map brain regions engaged during negative emotion recognition in young and aged animals. Young male and female mice successfully discriminated emotionally altered conspecifics, recruiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO) in a sex-specific manner. Fiber photometry revealed distinct activation dynamics in these regions, and chemogenetic inhibition of bidirectional BLA-MO projections abolished emotion recognition in male but not female mice. Notably, young human participants also showed sex-specific recruitment of BLA and OFC during negative facial emotion recognition. Moreover, aging selectively impaired emotion recognition in male mice, coinciding with reduced BLA activity. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of BLA in aged male mice rescued this deficit. Together, these findings identify a sex-dependent BLA-MO circuit as a conserved neural substrate for emotion recognition and demonstrate that age-related impairments can be reversed through targeted circuit-level intervention.",

    "content": "Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) regulates synaptic strength and neuronal signaling, with essential roles in cortical development and synaptic plasticity. Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SYNGAP1 cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, and autism. SYNGAP1 mutations often result in haploinsufficiency, providing a strong rationale for gene-targeted therapies. However, no treatment currently addresses the underlying genetic cause of SRID. Here, we developed a CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) approach to upregulate the functional Syngap1 allele in a SRID mouse model. CRISPRa activated Syngap1, normalized SynGAP protein expression and downstream signaling, and rescued working memory deficits. We validated the translational potential of this strategy in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory cortical neurons. CRISPRa rescued SYNGAP1 in two distinct loss-of-function variant lines. Together, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of mutation-independent transcriptional activation as a therapeutic approach for SRID and its broader applicability to haploinsufficiency disorders.",

    "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible \"zoom lens\" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>",

They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<sub>v</sub>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>",

    "title": "Linking Connectivity Dynamics to Symptom Severity and Cognitive Abilities in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An FNIRS Study",
    "content": "<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Lateral Na+ Diffusion in Apical Dendrites of Mouse CA1 Pyramidal Neurons",
    "content": "<p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <i>D</i><sub>Na+</sub> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>",

    "content": "<p>BLTP1 (Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Protein Family Member 1), previously known as Tweek, Kiaa1109, FSA, or 4932438A13Rik, is a nonvesicular lipid transport protein linked to Alkuraya&ndash;Ku&#x010d;inskas syndrome (AKS), an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. Although BLTP1 is known to be involved in the transfer of phospholipids between organellar membranes at membrane contact sites, its specific role during mammalian development remains poorly defined. Here we characterized the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <i>Bltp1</i> knock-out (<i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i>) mice of either sex. These mutant mice die perinatally, exhibiting reduced growth of intramuscular motor nerves and a reduction in the size of the NMJ, compared with littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <i>Bltp1</i><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <i>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></i> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
    "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

    "content": "IntroductionHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare transsynaptic neurodegenerative disorder arising from disruption of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), a neural circuit critical for motor coordination. Classical clinical presentation includes palatal tremor. While cerebrovascular etiology dominates reported cases, HOD secondary to intracranial infections remains poorly characterized, posing diagnostic challenges.Case presentationA 72-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with a 7-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Initial neuroimaging revealed right cerebellar hematoma with multiple brain abscesses. Antibacterial treatment achieved symptomatic improvement, but follow-up was lost. Seven months later, readmission occurred due to memory decline and personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left anterior medulla oblongata and hemosiderosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the absence of clinical manifestations of HOD, prior abscess-induced GMT involvement strongly supported the diagnosis. Symptomatic management stabilized the patient, with persistent lesions but no clinical progression at 5-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case documents a rare case of HOD following bacterial brain abscess, presenting with atypical clinical features. It expands the etiological spectrum of HOD and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in post-infectious neurological deterioration. Multimodal MRI facilitates early diagnosis and timely intervention, highlighting its critical role in managing this underrecognized entity.",

    "title": "From early symptoms to EEG silence: tracking the neurodegenerative course of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease",
    "content": "BackgroundSporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Early diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific initial symptoms. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is a key diagnostic tool, particularly through the detection of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs), the longitudinal evolution of EEG features and their correlation with clinical and neuroimaging progression are not fully characterized.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed 37 patients diagnosed with probable and very probable sCJD according to the 2021 Chinese diagnostic guidelines. All patients underwent at least one EEG examination. One representative patient was followed for 23\u202fweeks with serial EEG and MRI studies to document dynamic electrophysiological and structural changes. EEG background activity was graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and PSWCs were identified based on standardized criteria. MRI analyses focused on the spatial and temporal progression of hyperintense lesions on DWI and FLAIR sequences.ResultsAmong the 37 patients, 46% underwent initial EEG within 1\u202fmonth of symptom onset, and 49% exhibited severe background abnormalities. PSWCs were present in 84% of patients at first EEG, with a high prevalence (82%) even in those examined within 4\u202fweeks of onset. Longitudinal analysis in the index case revealed a progressive EEG deterioration: from slowed and disorganized background rhythms and emerging triphasic waves at 8\u202fweeks, to widespread PSWCs with increasing periodicity (9\u201316\u202fweeks), and finally to a burst-suppression pattern near electrical silence by week 23. Concurrent MRI showed a parallel expansion of hyperintense lesions from unilateral cortical and basal ganglia regions to bilateral involvement, closely correlated with the EEG progression. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between survival time and age, time to first EEG, CSF 14\u20133-3 protein status, or initial EEG background grade. Furthermore, neither the presence of typical PSWCs nor the severity of background activity was associated with survival outcomes.ConclusionEEG, especially the early and highly prevalent presence of PSWCs, offers high diagnostic value in sCJD but does not serve as prognostic predictors. The close correlation between EEG decline and MRI progression supports multimodal monitoring. Serial EEG should be integrated into sCJD diagnosis and follow-up.",

This study aimed to validate and extend the MHP by analyzing P300 and Bereitschaftspotential (BP) brainwave components.MethodsOur initial finding of qualitatively different neural signatures between correct and incorrect trials led to the hypothesis that the \u201ccorrect\u201d trial group is a mixture of different processing types. We tested this by segregating correct trials based on the presence or absence of the P300 component, which we reasoned is a key marker of the MHP\u2019s conscious \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.ResultsWe identified a P300-absent subgroup even among correct responses. This subgroup exhibited significantly shorter reaction times than its P300-present counterpart and showed a neural signature strikingly similar to that of incorrect trials, including a delayed negative peak in the BP.DiscussionThese results suggest the human information processing pathway is not monolithic. We propose a new model that bifurcates after perception into either a \u201cDeliberate Process\u201d (P300-present), which aligns with the MHP, or a high-speed \u201cAutomatic Process\u201d (P300-absent) that bypasses the MHP\u2019s \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.

This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking.

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Localization performance of cochlear implant users with a real-time bilaterally-synchronized sound coding strategy that provides explicit interaural timing cues with mixed rates of stimulation",
    "content": "IntroductionBilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs) do not restore sound localization abilities to the full extent exhibited by typical hearing (TH) listeners, partly due to poor encoding of interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD cues have been provided and investigated using synchronized research processors that ensure the precise delivery of ITD cues. These studies have been conducted in a direct stimulation setting, which bypasses the processor microphones and, in most cases, removes interaural level difference cues (ILDs). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the efficacy of synchronized stimulation in restoring sensitivity to ITDs in a free field localization experiment. This was made possible by the CCi-MOBILE, a portable and real-time processing research platform that allows for synchronizing microphone inputs.MethodsFourteen BiCI listeners were tested with experimental real-time coding strategies in comparison to unsynchronized clinical processors. We calculated the binaural cues from the acoustic stimuli at the level of microphone input.ResultsThe recordings show that the experimental coding strategies in this study deliver ITDs with greater precision than the clinical strategy. However, psychophysical testing did not show the benefit of an ITD-encoding strategy in improving localization in a free field. The ITD encoding strategies preserved ITDs, which better differentiated unique loudspeaker locations than interaural level differences (ILDs), suggesting that listeners could achieve improved performance if they accessed these cues. As expected, ILDs were similar across all strategies, including the ITD encoding strategies. The lack of improvement in localization performance is likely because ILDs remained to be the dominant cue in acute localization testing, even when ITD cues were available.DiscussionProviding BiCI listeners with adequate experiences with ITD cues may be necessary to shift their reliance from ILD dominance to a combined reliance on ILD and ITD cues in free-field conditions. The CCi-MOBILE could enable take-home practice with novel stimulation strategies for extended experiences and long-term evaluation in real-world listening environments.",

We tested whether pathway-specific PRS, targeting areas of biology including tau binding, lipid metabolism, and immune response, are differentially associated with diffusion MRI measures across the lifespan.MethodsWe analyzed two population-based cohorts: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; mean age = 19.8 years, n = 517) and UK Biobank (mean age = 64.2 years, n = 18,172). Genome-wide and nine pathway-specific PRS for Alzheimer\u2019s disease were constructed using GWAS summary statistics and a clumping threshold of r2 < 0.2 at p < 0.001. Diffusion MRI data were processed separately within each cohort: in ALSPAC, tract-based fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted using probabilistic tractography from native-space regions of interest; in UK Biobank, diffusion metrics were derived from TBSS-aligned skeletons and standard atlas-based ROIs. Analyses focused on three tracts vulnerable to early AD pathology: the dorsal cingulum, parahippocampal cingulum, and fornix. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess PRS associations with FA and MD, adjusting for demographic, scanner, and genetic ancestry covariates. False discovery rate correction addressed multiple comparisons, and sensitivity analyses were performed excluding the APOE region.ResultsIn UK Biobank, higher PRS for protein\u2013lipid complex assembly and tau protein binding were robustly associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity in both dorsal and parahippocampal cingulum segments (False discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05), explaining more variance than APOE alone; no significant effects emerged in the fornix. Genome-wide PRS showed weaker, non-significant associations. In ALSPAC, no PRS metric survived FDR correction, though nominal trends appeared in the dorsal cingulum. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that key cingulum associations in older adults persisted after omitting APOE.ConclusionPathway-specific polygenic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease manifests in white matter microstructure by mid- to late adulthood but not in early adulthood, suggesting an age-dependent emergence of genetic effects. dMRI phenotypes may thus serve as intermediate biomarkers for dissecting mechanistic pathways of preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease vulnerability.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in various chronic disorders. Current pharmacological and neuromodulatory interventions are constrained by limitations such as adverse effects and invasiveness. Acupuncture, a cornerstone of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), demonstrates potential for bidirectionally modulating ANS function, yet systematic evidence remains scarce.MethodsA meta-analysis was conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved from PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and CENTRAL databases from their inception until 1 August 2025. Data on baseline characteristics, heart rate variability (HRV) parameters (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), LF/HF), and adverse events were extracted. Analyses were performed using random-effects models.ResultsTen RCTs comprising 744 patients were included. Acupuncture significantly improved SDNN. True effect sizes for LF and HF suggested potential differences, but considerable uncertainty was evident. The incidence of adverse events was low, with no serious events reported.ConclusionAcupuncture may confer modest improvements in ANS function, particularly evidenced by SDNN enhancement, and exhibits a favorable safety profile. However, the evidence is constrained by heterogeneity and methodological limitations, necessitating further validation through high-quality studies.",

The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "title": "The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test for adults: A refined version in Spanish.",
    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved.

Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "Pylint 4 changes what's considered a constant. Does a use case exist?",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Pylint 4 changed their definition of constants. Previously, all variables at the root of a module were considered constants and expected to be in all caps. With Pylint 4, they are now checking to see if a variable is reassigned non-exclusively. If it is, then it's treated as a &quot;module-level variable&quot; and expected to be in snake case.</p> <p>So this pattern, which used to be valid, now raises an invalid-name warning.</p> <pre><code>SERIES_STD = ' \u258c\u2588' if platform.system() == 'Windows' else ' \u258f\u258e\u258d\u258c\u258b\u258a\u2589\u2588' try: SERIES_STD.encode(sys.__stdout__.encoding) except UnicodeEncodeError: SERIES_STD = ' |' except (AttributeError, TypeError): pass </code></pre> <p>This could be re-written to match the new definition of a constant, but doing so reduces readability.</p> <p>In my mind any runtime code is placed in classes, function or guarded with a dunder name clause. This only leaves code needed for module initialization. Within that, I see two categories of variables at the module root, constants and globals.</p> <ul> <li>Constants <ul> <li>After value is determine (like above example), it never changes</li> <li>All caps</li> </ul></li> <li>Globals <ul> <li>After the value is determined, it can be changed within a function/method via the global keyword</li> <li>snake case, but should also start with an underscore or <code>__all__</code> should be defined and exclude them (per <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#global-variable-names\">PEP8</a>)</li> <li>rare, Pylint complains when the global keyword is used</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Pylint 4 uses the following categories</p> <ul> <li>Constants <ul> <li>Value is assigned once, exclusively</li> <li>All caps</li> </ul></li> <li>Module-level variables <ul> <li>Any variable that is assigned more than once, non-exclusively</li> <li>snake case</li> <li>Includes globals as defined above</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>A big distinction here is I do not think exclusive assignment should make a difference because it means the pattern of (assign, test, fallback) is invalid for a constant. I treat both assignment statements in the above example as part of determining the value of the constant.</p> <p>I have been unable to see a real case where you'd change the value of a variable at the module root after it's initial value is determined and not violate some other good coding practice.</p> <p>I've been looking for 4 days and haven't found any good examples that benefit from the new behavior in Pylint 4. Every example seems to have something scary in it, like parsing a config file as part of module initialization, and, once refactored to follow other good practices, the reassignment of module-level variables disappears.</p> <p>Does someone have an example?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/avylove\"> /u/avylove </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oj4mcr/pylint_4_changes_whats_considered_a_constant_does/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oj4mcr/pylint_4_changes_whats_considered_a_constant_does/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

    "title": "Cholinergic heterogeneity facilitates synchronization and information flow in a whole-brain model",
    "content": "The human brain displays substantial regional variability in molecular, anatomical, and physiological organization. Yet, how this heterogeneity shapes large-scale neuronal dynamics remains poorly understood. To address this question, we employed a biologically informed whole-brain computational model capable of generating distinct brain states, from awake-like to sleep-like regimes. Our model was constrained by empirical human structural connectivity and spatial maps of cholinergic receptor gene expression, thereby embedding regional neuromodulatory variability into a macroscopic framework. We found that incorporating cholinergic heterogeneity had a significant impact on brain dynamics: it not only facilitated network synchronization but also enhanced information flow between brain regions. Furthermore, we addressed a particularly intricate dynamic regime characterized by the coexistence of localized sleep-like activity within otherwise awake-like states. We showed that the emergence of these slow waves was a byproduct of both regional levels of neuronal adaptation and structural connectivity. In summary, our findings highlight the critical role of molecular and anatomical heterogeneity in shaping global brain dynamics, suggesting new avenues for linking microscale diversity to macroscale function.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

    "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "title": "Visualization and Morphological Analysis of Individual Oligodendrocytes in the Mouse White Matter",
    "content": "Myelin formation by oligodendrocytes is essential for the regulation of the conduction velocity and proper brain function. To ensure accurate information processing in response to experiences such as sensory stimuli and learning, oligodendrocytes adjust their number and morphology. In addition, oligodendrocyte morphology changes with senescence and in the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, visualizing oligodendrocytes and analyzing their morphology is crucial for understanding how our brains change under such conditions. Herein, we describe the methods for labeling and analyzing the morphologies of individual oligodendrocytes in mouse white matter at the light microscopic level. PDGFRa-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP and PLP-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP mice enable us to visualize and analyze later-born or early-born oligodendrocyte morphology. In addition, sparse oligodendrocyte labeling with attenuated rabies virus expressing GFP enables the visualization and morphological analysis of individual oligodendrocytes in various brain white matter regions without the need for transgenic animals. Furthermore, the combination with immunostaining in thick tissues enables the identification of labeled oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths, as well as their interactions with neuronal axons. These methods are suitable for revealing how oligodendrocytes adapt their morphologies depending on environmental stimuli or pathological conditions.",

    "title": "Integrated analysis implicates novel insights of NMB into lactate metabolism and immune response prediction in primary glioblastoma",
    "content": "Background: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, exhibits profound treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Despite advances in immunotherapy for other cancers, GBM remains refractory, potentially due to its lactate-rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While aerobic glycolysis-driven lactate accumulation is known to acidify the TME and impair immune function, the precise mechanisms linking lactate metabolism to immune evasion in GBM remain elusive. Methods: We integrated multi-omics analyses with machine learning to identify - gene signatures associated lactate metabolism (LM) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Multiple bioinformatic tools were employed to determine the association of key genes with TME remodeling, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivities. Results: Neuromedin B (NMB) emerged as a pivotal regulator of lactate-mediated immunosuppression, correlating strongly with LM and TIDE. We found that NMB expression was remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics, immune response, TME remodeling and drug sensitivities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NMB is a key cross-factor in metabolic and immune regulation in GBM. It breaks through the traditional perception that metabolism and immunity are mutually exclusive in cancer by promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and enhancing anti-tumor immunity through its dual functions. It provides a new direction for the combined intervention of metabolic targeting and immunotherapy, and the strong predictive value of NMB expression for drug response further highlights its clinical application potential in the formulation of personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients.",

    "title": "Ascending nociceptive pathways drive rapid escape and sustained avoidance in adult Drosophila",
    "content": "Nociception -- the detection of harmful stimuli by the nervous system -- contributes to both rapid escape and long-term avoidance behaviors. Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.",

    "title": "Optimizing real-time phase detection in diverse rhythmic biological signals for phase-specific neurostimulation",
    "content": "Objective. Closed-loop, phase-specific neurostimulation is a powerful method to modulate ongoing brain activity for clinical and research applications. Phase-specific stimulation relies on estimating the phase of an ongoing oscillation in real time and issuing a control command at a target phase. Phase detection algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used due to their computational efficiency and robustness. However, it is unclear how algorithm performance depends on the spectral properties of the input signal and how algorithm parameters can be optimized. Approach. We evaluated the in silico performance of three phase detection algorithms [Endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT), Hilbert transform (HT), and phase mapping (PM)] on three real-world biological signals with distinct spectral properties (theta oscillations from rodent hippocampal local field potential, alpha oscillations from human electroencephalogram (EEG), and hand movement kinematics from essential tremor patients) to identify the optimal model and parameters. We then validated the performance of an algorithm for estimating theta phase in real-time using rats implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus. Results. First, we found that signal amplitude and frequency variations strongly influence algorithm performance. Frequency-specific signal-to-noise ratio was positively correlated with performance (mean R2 = 0.42 across metrics), while amplitude and frequency variability were negatively correlated (mean R2 = 0.50 across metrics). Second, we showed that the length of the data window used for phase estimation is the key parameter for optimal performance of FFT-based algorithms, where the optimal data window length corresponds to the period of the oscillation (\u223c150 ms for hippocampal theta oscillations, \u223c100 ms for human EEG alpha, and \u223c125 ms for essential tremor kinematics). We validated this finding in vivo by estimating the phase of theta oscillations from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, where a data window length corresponding to one theta cycle yielded the best performance across all metrics compared with shorter or longer window lengths. Significance. Our findings clarify the relationship between signal properties and algorithm performance and provide a convenient method for optimizing FFT-based phase detection algorithms. We show that a data window length corresponding to one cycle of an oscillation can lead to improved performance.",

    "content": "This study examines the relationship between employment status and dream content using a data set of 6,478 dream reports collected from Reddit. We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns. This study establishes the feasibility of leveraging large-scale, publicly available data to explore the dream content of subpopulations.

This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

It's just a few static html files served on GitHub Pages, and all the .whl files are pulled directly from <code>cgohlke/geospatial-wheels</code>. All you need to do is add an <code>index</code> flag:</p> <p><code> pip install --index https://gisidx.github.io/gwi gdal </code></p> <p>In addition to GDAL, this index points to the other prebuilt packages in <code>geospatial-wheels</code>: cartopy, cftime, fiona, h5py, netcdf4, pygeos, pyogrio, pyproj, rasterio, rtree, and shapely.</p> <p>Contributions are welcome!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Mostly folks who straddle the traditional GIS and the developer/data science worlds, the people who would love to run Linux but are stuck on Windows for one reason or another. </p> <p>For myself, I'm tired of dealing with the lack of an easy way to install the GDAL binaries on Windows so that I can <code>pip install gdal</code>, especially in a <code>uv</code> virtual environment or a CI/CD context where using <code>conda</code> can be a headache.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Often you'll have to build these packages from source or rely on <code>conda</code> or another add-on package manager. For example, the official GDAL docs suggest <a href=\"https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html#windows\">various ways</a> to install the binaries. This is often not possible or requires extra work.</p> <p>The esteemed Christoph Gohlke has been providing prebuilt wheels for GDAL and other packages for a long time, and currently they can be found at his repository, <a href=\"https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels\">geospatial-wheels</a>. Awesome! But you have to manually find the one that matches your environment, download it somewhere, and then <code>pip install</code> the file... Still pretty annoying and difficult to automate. This index project simplifies the process down to the easy and portable <code>pip install</code>.</p> <p>This project was partly inspired by <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/gdal-installer/\">gdal-installer</a> which is also worth checking out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pvdp-corbel\"> /u/pvdp-corbel </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oiufp2/a_new_easy_way_on_windows_to_pip_install_gdal_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oiufp2/a_new_easy_way_on_windows_to_pip_install_gdal_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p>Hey all!<p>I'm happy to announce we've finally released our 2nd macOS app, Draw Over It, a tiny desktop app that enables drawing, highlighting, or annotating directly on top of anything on your Mac.<p>I've always wanted something like this for instant and unobtrusive sketching and annotation for pair programming and demos. I always found the standard web-based diagram and drawing tools a bit too cumbersome. So we built a simple overlay that could appear over any window or app with one shortcut.<p>It doesn't collect any user data and doesn't require any system permissions - it's sandboxed. It all stays on your device. You can export your annotations to a PNG with one click - or just take a screenshot if you need the background too.<p>It offers a slim but functional toolkit for every day tasks:<p>- Global hotkeys, hit a shortcut and start drawing over any app<p>- Multiple tools, pens, shapes, highlighters<p>- Per-screen canvases, each monitor gets its own space<p>- Focus mode, temporarily blur the background to emphasize what matters<p>- Low footprint, no subscriptions, no sign-ups, no data collected<p>- Localization, the app is translated to 14 languages<p>These two reasons make it different from other canvas apps, it's simple, lean and keeps your data on-device only.<p>It\u2019s a one-time purchase ($2.99) on the Mac App Store.<p>I\u2019d love feedback and suggestions for improvements!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45747402\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45747402</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

These network-level effects strengthen the rationale for using tDCS in PD, particularly as a potential therapeutic option in the intermediate stage.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding?

In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "Increased cocaine self-administration and prefrontal cortical dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling in a rat model for sensory processing sensitivity",
    "content": "While all organisms are tuned to the environment, some are more sensitive than others. In humans, this is reflected by the trait sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), which is characterized by heightened emotional reactivity, deeper information processing, greater awareness of their environment, and susceptibility to overstimulation. It is expected but unproven that high SPS increases the risk for psychostimulant use. To clarify this, we selected Wistar rats on behavioral extremes related to SPS and subjected them to isolation, neutral, and enriched housing conditions, followed by cocaine self-administration. Subsequently, we investigated neurobiological differences in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission of the low- and high SPS-like rats by evaluating key glutamatergic and GABAergic proteins in the infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the prefrontal cortex. High SPS-like rats displayed higher cocaine intake during self-administration training sessions in isolated versus social conditions, whereas low SPS-like rats showed similar intake across housing conditions. During extended access self-administration sessions, high SPS-like rats displayed a higher cocaine intake regardless of housing and greater motivation for cocaine under a progressive ratio scheme. High SPS-like cocaine-naive rats exhibited lower expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers in the infra limbic and prelimbic cortex compared to low SPS-like cocaine-naive rats. The opposite occurred after cocaine exposure: low and high SPS-like rats showed lower and higher expression levels, respectively, compared to naive counterparts. In conclusion, these findings suggest that a high SPS-like trait with associated glutamatergic and GABAergic alterations might be a risk factor for the development of cocaine use disorder.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "Leveraging hand-crafted radiomics on multicenter FLAIR MRI for predicting disability worsening in people with multiple sclerosis",
    "content": "BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, leading to varying degrees of functional impairment. Conventional tools, such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), lack sensitivity to subtle disease worsening. Radiomics provides a quantitative imaging approach to address this limitation. This study applied machine learning (ML) and radiomics features from T2-weighted Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict disability worsening in MS.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on real-world data from 247 PwMS across two centers. Disability worsening was defined as a change in EDSS over two years. FLAIR MRIs underwent preprocessing and super-resolution reconstruction to enhance low-resolution images. White matter lesions (WML) were segmented using the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (LST), and tissue segmentation was performed using sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation. Radiomics features from WML and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were extracted using Pyradiomics, harmonized with Longitudinal ComBat, followed by recursive feature elimination for feature selection. Elastic Net, Balanced Random Forest (BRFC), and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) models were trained and evaluated.ResultsThe LGBM model with harmonized radiomics and clinical features outperformed the clinical-only model, achieving a test area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.20 and a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.64. Key predictive features, among others, included Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) maximum probability (WML) and Gray-Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM) dependence non-uniformity (NAWM). However, short-term longitudinal changes showed limited predictive power (PR AUC = 0.11, ROC AUC = 0.69).ConclusionThese findings highlight the potential of ML-driven radiomics in predicting disability worsening, warranting validation in larger, balanced datasets and exploration of advanced deep learning approaches.",

    "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",

This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life.

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance.

Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Early contingency information enhances human punishment sensitivity when punishment is frequent but not rare.",
    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

However, the complexity of multichannel clinical systems and processing techniques can limit their accessibility outside specialized centers, where complex setups are not feasible. This paper presents a proof-of-concept prototype of a single-channel EEG acquisition and processing system designed to...",

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value. Our goal in this article is not to define\nconcrete guidelines for study selection, but to provide the necessary\ntheoretical foundations on which such concrete guidelines could be built.\n(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights\nreserved).&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Psychological Methods&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1037/met0000438&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;1939-1463&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Psychol\nMethods&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n34928679&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;438-451&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Deciding\nwhat to replicate: A decision model for replication study selection under\nresource and knowledge constraints&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;Deciding\nwhat to\nreplicate&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;28&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Isager&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Peder\nMortvedt&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Aert&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Robbie\nC.\nM.&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;van&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Bahn\u00edk&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Brandt&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Mark\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;DeSoto&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;K.\nAndrew&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Giner-Sorolla&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Roger&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Krueger&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joachim\nI.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Perugini&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marco&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Ropovik&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ivan&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Veer&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Anna\nE.&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;van\n't&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Vranka&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marek&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2023&quot;,4]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:181,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/QYUHTHX2&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:181,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Replication\nof published results is crucial for ensuring the robustness and self-correction\nof research, yet replications are scarce in many fields.

Here we move one step closer to\nefficient replication study selection by exploring the feasibility of a\nparticular selection strategy that estimates replication value as a function of\ncitation impact and sample size (Isager, van 't Veer, &amp; Lakens, 2021). We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication. In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about. But they should care about it. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I hope\nstatisticians will start to scrutinize things appropriate to their popularity.\nIf a statistical technique is cited 500 times, 3 statisticians need to drop\nwhatever they are doing, and scrutinize the hell out of this technique. We can\nrandomly select them for \u2018statisticians duty\u2019.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Quality\ncontrol in science</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It might\ncome as a surprise, but I don\u2019t actually think we should stop using methods\nthat are not adequately vetted by psychologists, or statisticians for that\nmatter, because I don\u2019t want a science where authorities tell others which\nmethods they can use. Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone. Sometimes even a lowly 20% statistician can point out flaws in\nmethods proposed by card-carrying statisticians. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we can\ndo better is implementing actual quality control. Journal peer review will not\nsuffice, because it is only as good as the two or three peers that happen to be\nwilling and available to review a paper. But it is a start. We should enable\nresearchers to see how well papers are peer reviewed by journals. Without\ntransparency, we can\u2019t calibrate our trust </span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;DuUONcRk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire,\n2017)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire, 2017)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/6IRLDTML&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Article:\nQuality Uncertainty Erodes Trust in\nScience&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Collabra:\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1525/collabra.74&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2474-7394&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Authors\nwho publish with this journal agree to the following terms:<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>Authors retain copyright and grant the\njournal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under\na<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Creative Commons Attribution\nLicense<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>that allows others to share the\nwork with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in\nthis journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Authors are able to enter\ninto separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive\ndistribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to\nan institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement\nof its initial publication in this journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in\ninstitutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the\nsubmission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier\nand greater citation of published work (See<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>The Effect of Open Access ).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>All\nthird-party images reproduced on this journal are shared under Educational Fair\nUse.

Peer reviews should be open, for\nall papers, including papers proposing new statistical methods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If we want\nour statistical methods to be of high quality, we need to specify quality\nstandards. Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "title": "Tracking Sleep-Linked Brain Fluid Dynamics Using Modified fNIRS: A Novel Noninvasive Window into Glymphatic Function",
    "content": "Background: The glymphatic system, a brain-wide perivascular and interstitial waste and signal transport pathway for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exchange with interstitial fluid (ISF), has pronounced activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury, Alzheimers disease, and mood disorders. However, direct measurement in humans is limited because current imaging methods rely on intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is unsuitable for routine or naturalistic sleep studies. The absence of real-time, noninvasive monitoring methods that allow for natural sleep poses a major barrier to advancing glymphatic research in clinical settings. Methods: To address this barrier, we developed a non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) forehead array in a wearable headband using non-standard wavelengths to allow for better sensitivity for water measurement. We monitored cortical blood and water dynamics during overnight sleep, quantifying oscillatory patterns of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and water across sleep stages within the outer layers of the frontal cortex, subarachnoid space, and scalp. A component of the extracted water metrics is hypothesized to serve as a proxy for glymphatic transport without the need for contrast agents or surgical intervention. Results: Our results demonstrate water concentrations were highest in SWS (d = 1.93, p=0.0002), while HbO concentrations also showed a modest elevation (d = 1.06, ns). Additionally, low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) of both water and HbO signals exhibited distinct dynamics of suprathreshold envelope peak (SEP) frequencies during NREM stages (N2 and N3) as compared to REM and wake, with effect size (d= 1.31, p = 0.003) for water. Interestingly, these water-derived metrics correlate with EEG slow-wave activity, linking fluid-sensitive oscillations to established electrophysiological markers of sleep depth. These findings indicate that water-sensitive oscillatory processes are selectively amplified during deep sleep and scale with EEG-defined sleep depth, consistent with a role for glymphatic-related fluid transport in human sleep. Conclusion: We report novel cortical water shift parameters that are robustly sensitive to sleep stage transitions via a wearable, non-invasive, scalable headband, consistent with predicted glymphatic activity. Future work will cross-validate this method with MRI and other techniques.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a widespread condition with profound psychological, educational, and occupational consequences. Despite increasing academic attention, few studies have systematically mapped the thematic development of PSA research or anticipated future directions. This study employs a semantically enriched framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with Word2Vec to analyze 990 peer-reviewed journal articles (1995\u20132024) retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning SSCI, SCI-Expanded, ESCI, and A&amp;HCI indices. Nine major thematic clusters are identified, covering topics such as mental health distress, physiological reactivity, language apprehension, social phobia, and virtual reality interventions. Thematic evolution across four historical phases reveals growing conceptual convergence and an increasing focus on digital anxiety and assessment technologies. A Sankey diagram illustrates patterns of thematic continuity and transformation, highlighting both enduring topics and emerging lines of inquiry. To predict future research frontiers, two novelty indicators\u2014Cluster Novelty and Topic Novelty\u2014are introduced. Clusters focused on language learning (Topic 4), virtual therapy (Topic 6), and psychometric tools (Topic 8) emerge as the most temporally novel.

Neurophysiological tools offer objective markers of emotional reactions in multisensory environments, where positive valence promotes approach behavior and negative valence fosters avoidance.MethodsWe applied the Osgood semantic differential (SD) to establish correspondences between visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli and target emotions relevant to retail zoning. Based on SD results, we selected stimuli to create multisensory environments. These were presented in immersive virtual reality (VR) to 27 participants. Emotional responses were assessed via heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity (EDA).ResultsSD analysis identified cross-modal associations between sensory stimuli and retail zones, allowing refinement of semantic positioning. VR experiments revealed that HRV significantly increased in pleasant environments, indicating enhanced parasympathetic activation. HR and EDA showed no significant correlation with emotional valence, though both displayed trends toward reduction in pleasant conditions.DiscussionOur findings suggest that HRV is a reliable physiological marker of consumers\u2019 approach behavior in multisensory retail environments, whereas HR and EDA are less sensitive.

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "content": "BackgroundAPOE4 and APP are two of the main genetic risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Although there have been suggestions that these two factors interact, most of the in vivo evidence for such interactions comes from transgenic mouse models that suffer from complications associated with protein overexpression. Our goal was to examine the consequences of interactions between APOE4 and APP on brain function while avoiding the use of transgenic mice.MethodsWe generated and characterized double-mutant knock-in mice incorporating familial APP mutations and humanized APOE4.ResultsIn the brains of 3-month-old double-mutant mice there were significant alterations in vascular remodeling genes, vascular structure and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. These changes were not observed in either APOE4 or APP single-mutant mice and, thus, were caused by interactions between the two genes. These interaction effects were transient, because they were absent in 8-month-old double-mutant mice.ConclusionThese findings indicate that early vascular changes, driven by the interaction of APP and APOE4, may influence the progression of AD. Our work highlights the need to focus on the synergistic vascular actions of APOE4 and APP, particularly at younger ages.",

We investigated whether resting-state interhemispheric quantitative EEG (qEEG) coherence\u2014a measure of functional connectivity between homologous cortical regions\u2014could serve as a biomarker of GD.MethodsTwenty-nine male patients with GD and 45 healthy male controls underwent resting-state qEEG recording. Coherence was computed for homologous electrode pairs across delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Group differences were analyzed using independent-samples t-tests; associations with disorder duration were assessed via age-controlled partial correlations.ResultsConsistent with our hypothesis, GD participants exhibited frontal pole hypercoherence (Fp1\u2013Fp2) across delta, theta, and beta bands, which is likely influenced by prefrontal/orbitofrontal generators. In contrast, GD showed hypocoherence in temporal (T3\u2013T4, T5\u2013T6), central (C3\u2013C4), and parietal (P3\u2013P4) regions across these frequencies. Greater disorder duration was associated with lower beta coherence at F3\u2013F4 and Fp1\u2013Fp2, and higher delta coherence at O1\u2013O2.ConclusionsThese findings reveal a dual pattern of interhemispheric connectivity disruption in GD\u2014hypercoherence at frontal pole sites and hypocoherence in sensorimotor and attentional posterior networks\u2014supporting theoretical models of addiction neurocircuitry. Resting-state qEEG coherence holds promise as a clinically relevant biomarker for GD and may inform the development of neuromodulatory interventions aimed at network rebalancing.",

    "content": "Objective. Chronic pain affects over 20% of the adult population in the United States, posing a substantial personal as well as economic burden and contributing to the ongoing opioid crisis. Effective, non-addictive chronic pain treatments are urgently needed. Traditional drug discovery methods have failed to identify novel, non-addictive compounds, highlighting the need for alternative approaches such as phenotypic screening. Our lab developed a phenotypic screening assay using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from co-cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell sensory neurons and glia. This study aimed to identify responsive neuronal subtypes within these presumptively heterogeneous cultures. Approach. We induced an inflammation-like state using tumor necrosis factor alpha and evaluated acute responses to nociceptor agonist capsaicin, which targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1. By employing unsupervised learning, we labeled responsive cells based on changes in mean firing rates (MFR). We then used the labeled cells\u2019 baseline activity to train and validate five classifiers. Main results. None of the classifiers outperformed the others in regards to accuracy. Nonetheless, an RUS-boosted ensemble of decision trees achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.877 classifying nociceptors in an unseen labeled culture. Significance. The notable accuracy suggests that machine learning techniques could be employed to enhance microelectrode array-based neuronal phenotypic assays as readouts (e.g. MFR) can be weighted based on target cell type (e.g. nociceptors).",
