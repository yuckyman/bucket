    "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
    "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

    "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

    "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
    "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

    "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

    "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

    "content": "Binocular vision fuses similar inputs from the two eyes into a single percept, whereas incompatible inputs can produce rivalry, lustre, or diplopia. We measured neural responses to binocular stimuli with different phase relationships to test predictions from contemporary binocular combination models. Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from 15 observers in response to monocular and binocular stimulation at 3 Hz, using either On/Off or counterphase flicker with varied spatial and temporal phase relationships. On/Off and counterphase flicker elicited responses at the expected fundamental frequency (3 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively) and their harmonics. Manipulating phase relationships modulated these response patterns, including a reduction in the fundamental amplitude for On/Off flicker. The data were modeled with a series of binocular combination algorithms, ranging in complexity from a simple linear sum to a two-stage binocular gain-control model with parallel monocular and binocular phase-selective channels. The model required parallel monocular channels to account for our data, whereas phase selectivity was not essential. Overall, the two-stage contrast gain-control model remains a powerful and flexible framework for describing binocular combinations across various experimental conditions and modalities.",

    "title": "Reconstructing high-resolution visual perceptual images from human intracranial electrocorticography signals",
    "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",

However, existing commercial systems have limitations in flexibility and extensibility for research applications. Approach. We present new open-source software for neuronavigated non-invasive brain stimulation (NaviNIBS) that provides comprehensive functionality for TMS experiments. NaviNIBS supports imaging data import, target planning, head registration, real-time tool tracking, and integration with robotic positioning and electrophysiology systems. Key features include flexible target specification, support for multiple tracking hardware options, refined head registration techniques, and an extensible addon system. Main results. We describe the software architecture, core functionality, characterization of tracking performance, and example applications of NaviNIBS. Significance. By implementing NaviNIBS and sharing it with the research community, we aim to facilitate methodological improvements and novel experimental paradigms in noninvasive brain stimulation research.",

The denoising algorithm for these scenarios encounters challenges such as the lack of ground truth, and the noise distribution in the real world is far more complex than in a normal scene. Consequently, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like VRT and Turtle for video denoising perform poorly in this...",

The program allows single MIDI files or playlists of MIDI files to be loaded and visualised through a command-line tool.</p> <p>It's fairly simple, using Pygame to display the visualiser window and provide playback control, but I'm pretty proud of how it looks and the audio-syncing logic (which uses Mido to interpret MIDI events). More details on how to use it are available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/benjaminrall/midi-visualiser\">project repository</a>.</p> <p>This is the first project I've used <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\">uv</a> for, and I absolutely love it - check it out if you haven't already. Also, any suggestions/comments about the project would be greatly appreciated as I'm very new to uploading to PyPI!</p> <p>To summarise; - <strong>What My Project Does</strong>: Plays MIDI files and visualises them using a scrolling piano roll - <strong>Target Audience</strong>: Mainly just a toy project, but could be used by anyone who wants a simple &amp; quick way to view any MIDI file! - <strong>Comparison</strong>: I can't find any alternatives that have this same functionality (at least not made in Python) - it obviously can't compete with mega fancy MIDI visualisers, but a strong point is how straight forward the project is, working immediately from the command-line without needing any configuration.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ben2508\"> /u/Ben2508 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng9en6/midivisualiser_a_realtime_midi_player_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng9en6/midivisualiser_a_realtime_midi_player_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

    "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

    "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
    "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Saturation Compensation for High Dynamic Range Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging",
    "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

    "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

    "title": "Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neural Activity Switches Simultaneously with Rule Representations in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus",
    "content": "<p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<i>n</i> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<i>n</i> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as \"approach behaviors,\" include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<i>f</i> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>",

This process, state inference, requires an agent to guess the current state of the world given a set of observations. During value-based decision-making, a growing body of evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) in the process of contextualizing information and identifying links between stimuli, actions, and outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms driving these processes in primates remain unknown. To investigate how OFC and HPC contribute to state inference, we recorded simultaneously from both regions while two male monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task, where reward contingencies could be captured by two task states. Using population-level decoding, we found neural representations of task state in both OFC and HPC that remained stable within each trial but strengthened with learning as monkeys adapted to reversals. Subjects also appeared to use their understanding of task structure to anticipate reversals, evidenced by anticipatory neural representations of the upcoming task state.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human and nonhuman primate studies suggest that timing and tempo of cortical development varies neuroanatomically along a sensorimotor-to-association (S&ndash;A) axis. Prior human studies have reported a principal S&ndash;A axis across various modalities but largely rely on cross-sectional samples with wide age ranges. Here, we investigate developmental changes and individual variability therein along the S&ndash;A axis between the ages of 9&ndash;13&nbsp;years using a large, longitudinal sample (<i>N</i> = 2,487&ndash;3,747; 46&ndash;50% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study). This work assesses multiple aspects of neurodevelopment indexed by changes in cortical thickness, cortical microarchitecture, and resting-state low&ndash;frequency oscillations. First, we evaluated S&ndash;A organization in age-related changes and then computed individual-level S&ndash;A alignment in brain changes and assessing differences therein due to age, sex, and puberty. Age-related brain changes aligned linearly and quadratically with the S&ndash;A axis. Yet, these patterns of cortical development were overshadowed by considerable individual variability in S&ndash;A alignment. Even within individuals, there was little correspondence between S&ndash;A patterning across the different aspects of neurodevelopment investigated (i.e., cortical morphology, microarchitecture, function). Some of the individual variation in developmental patterning of cortical morphology and microarchitecture was explained by age, sex, and pubertal development. Altogether, this work contextualizes prior findings that regional age differences do progress along an S&ndash;A axis at a group level while highlighting broad variation in developmental change between individuals and between aspects of cortical development, in part due to sex and puberty.</p>",

    "title": "Organization of Brainwide Inputs to Discrete Lateral Septum Projection Populations",
    "content": "<p>The lateral septum (LS) is anatomically positioned to play a critical role in directing information from the hippocampus and cortex to downstream subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus. Early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of molecular markers within it. However, little is known about the organization of nonhypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. We used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six brain regions that mediate various social behaviors in male mice, specifically, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), periaqueductal gray (PAG), ventromedial hypothalamus (vmH), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy in male mice to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.</p>",

    "title": "Prediction Error-Related Memory Enhancement Depends on the Neural State Surrounding the Prediction Error Event",
    "content": "<p>Prediction errors (PEs) can enhance memory for preceding events. While such PE-related memory enhancements are critical for understanding adaptive memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with multivariate pattern analysis, this preregistered study aimed to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying PE effects on memory. Specifically, we tested whether PEs trigger a neural reactivation of the preceding stimulus and whether the PE-induced effects on memory depend on the specific neural state before the PE. We also examined whether inhibitory TMS over the superior parietal cortex (SPC) reduces PE effects on memory. A total of 118 participants (male and female) received inhibitory theta-burst or sham stimulation over the SPC before completing an incidental encoding-fear learning task. In this task, participants learned trial-unique stimuli and predicted whether these would be followed by an electric shock, while EEG was recorded. Recognition memory was tested 24&nbsp;h later. Our findings show that signed PEs enhance subsequent memory, depending on theta and alpha oscillations as well as neural category reactivation shortly before the PE. Moreover, this memory enhancement was associated with post-PE theta but not with PE-driven category reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation over the SPC led to a more conservative mnemonic response bias but left the PE effect on memory unaffected. Together, our findings reveal that PE effects on memory formation are influenced by neural states and representations surrounding the PE, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of adaptive memory formation.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After stroke, microglia and hematogenous macrophages, together referred to as M, clear dead cells and cellular debris in the infarcted brain through phagocytosis as an essential part of the recovery process. However, the phagocytic capability of M declines with age. Furthermore, aged M become overactivated in response to stroke, enhancing secondary brain injury. In this study, we demonstrated that by reversing the age-related dysfunctions in M through activating the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the recovery after stroke in the aged brain could be improved. Using RNA-sequencing, we compared the transcriptomes between M isolated from the brains of young and aged male mice. We observed higher levels of proinflammatory genes and lower levels of phagocytosis-facilitating genes (<i>Cd206</i> and <i>Cd36</i>) expressed by aged M. Meanwhile, the treatment with RXR agonist bexarotene (BEX) reversed the signature genes of microglia aging in the aged M. With the in vivo phagocytosis model, we showed that BEX enhanced the phagocytic ability of aged M. Using the MCAo stroke model and male and female mice, we established that BEX improved sensorimotor and cognitive recovery after MCAo in a myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;specific and myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;dependent manner. In conclusion, we showed that activating RXR&alpha; partially restores age-related M dysfunctions and that RXR&alpha; deficiency in M limits the therapeutic effect of RXR in improving poststroke recovery in the aged brain.</p>",

    "title": "Neural signatures of prioritization and facilitation in retrieving repeated items in visual working memory",
    "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) is a limited-capacity system where working memory items compete for retrieval. Some items are maintained in the working memory in the \u201cregion of direct access,\u201d which holds information readily available for processing, while other items are in a passive or activated long-term memory state and require cognitive control. Moreover, their recognition requires moving from the most active template in VWM to another one with the shift of attention. Stimulus properties based on similarity can link items together, which can facilitate their retrieval due to prioritization. To investigate the neural dynamics of differential processing of repeated versus not-repeated items in working memory, we designed a modified Sternberg task for testing recognition in a VWM-based EEG study where human participants respond to a probe for an item\u2019s presence or absence in the representation of an encoded memory array containing repeated and not repeated items. Significantly slower response times and comparatively poor accuracy for recognizing not-repeated items suggest that they are not prioritized. We identified specific differences in spectral perturbations for sensor clusters in the power of different frequency bands as the neural correlate of probe matching for not-repeated vs. repeated conditions, reflecting biased access to VWM items. For not-repeated item probe matching, delay in beta desynchronization suggests poor memory-guided action selection behavior. An increase in frontal theta and parietal alpha power demonstrated a demand for stronger cognitive control for retrieving items for not-repeated probe matching by shielding them from distracting repeated items. In summary, our study provides crucial empirical evidence of facilitation and prioritization of repeated items over non-repeated items and explains the probable role of different EEG rhythms in facilitated recognition of repeated items over goal-relevant, not-repeated items in VWM.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

    "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe population of older adults (OAs) is significantly increasing, and with that is the reality of OAs having hearing loss (HL). Although there is no hearing screening for adults, some OAs do consult their audiologist or otologist and receive a cochlear implant (CI). There are several studies showing that CI surgery in OAs is safe, and post-CI speech perception is similar to younger adults. However, there is little knowledge about what psychosocial factors may be associated with speech perception outcomes in OAs. The objective of this scoping review is to address these open questions.MethodsThis scoping review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies in English and German published between Jan 2020 and Jan 2025 reporting on psychosocial factors relating to speech perception outcomes in OAs with CIs.Results6/94 studies met the inclusion criteria. The six included publications considered the associations of quality of life, frailty, depression, and family support on speech perception in OAs with CIs. The association between these factors and sound perception was variable.ConclusionAlthough CIs are not uncommon as a treatment for HL in OAs, few studies have addressed the associations of psychosocial factors with speech perception in this population, or vice versa. More research needs to be conducted to determine these psychosocial factors and their impact on speech perception to better care for OAs with CIs.",

Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.",

    "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
    "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

    "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
    "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
    "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "The nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum pathway regulates social play behavior via sex-specific mechanisms in juvenile rats",
    "content": "Social play behavior is a rewarding behavior predominantly displayed by juveniles of various mammalian species, including humans and rats. Although the mesolimbic reward system is involved in the regulation of social play, how brain regions in this system interact to regulate social play behavior is unknown. Here, we determined the involvement of the ventral pallidum (VP) as well as inputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to the VP in the regulation of social play in male and female juvenile rats. We show that acute pharmacological inactivation of the VP, via microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. Next, using Gad1-iCre rats, we show that chemogenetic stimulation of NAcGABA terminals in the VP decreased VP neuronal activation and decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. These findings together indicate that reduced inhibitory NAc input to the VP permits activation of the VP which facilitates the expression of social play behaviors. Lastly, we show that the equal expression of social play behavior in males and females is associated with a female-specific increase in NAc shell activation and a male-specific decrease in activation of the NAc shell neurons projecting to the VP. These sex-specific changes in NAc activity following social play exposure eliminated baseline sex differences in NAc activity. In conclusion, these findings support a model in which the sex-specific modulation of NAc inhibitory input to the VP facilitates activation of the VP that is necessary for the typical and equal expression of social play behavior in male and female juvenile rats.",

    "title": "How the characteristics of a virtual environment affects the perception of travel distance through it",
    "content": "Although simulated self-motion through virtual environments has been widely used to investigate perceptual odometry, the characteristics of the virtual environments used, and the reported results have varied greatly. Here, we systematically vary the characteristics of the environment through which observers are moved in order to explore the effect of (1) the structure of an environment including the presence and texture of a ground surface, (2) the naturalism and scale of an environment, (3) colour, and (4) the density of a starfield and how it might affect perceived travel distance. In all four experiments, participants were visually moved forwards through a virtual environment and perceived travel distance was estimated by either (1) stopping at the location of a previously seen target (the Move-To-Target Task) or (2) adjusting the position of a target to indicate a previously travelled distance (the Adjust-Target Task). Data were analyzed in terms of gain (perceived travel distance/actual travel distance). Results show no significant differences that depended on the structure of an environment or on the presence or absence of a ground surface (Experiment 1), or on the naturalism of the environment (Experiment 2), or on whether the environment was in colour or in black and white (Experiment 3). However, there was a small effect of the texture of the ground surface and of the scale of the environment. In Experiment 4, we show that there may be a very low ceiling effect in the density of a starfield needed to accurately estimate travel distance. Together these experiments have implications for the design of real and virtual environments where perceived motion is important and will enable us to further predict our perception of moving through an environment.",

However, due to logistical and financial hurdles, this compelling part of neuroscience research is generally lacking in classroom education. To address this issue, here we introduce RetINaBox: a low-cost open-source electronic retina simulator that provides users with a hands-on system to discover how the visual system builds feature detectors. RetINaBox features an LED array for generating visual stimuli and a photodiode array that acts as a mosaic of model photoreceptors. Custom software on a Raspberry Pi computer reads out responses from model photoreceptors and allows users to control the polarity and delay of the signal transfer from model photoreceptors to model retinal ganglion cells. Interactive lesson plans are provided, guiding users to discover different types of visual feature detectors - including center-surround, orientation selective, and direction selective receptive fields - as well as their underlying circuit computations.",

However, a coherent understanding of their general function is lacking due to difficulties in directly recording from these cells and identifying effective visual stimuli to activate them. In this study, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to investigate wide-field inhibition mediated by wide-field ACs in the marmoset retina. We trained CNNs to mimic the function of the retina by predicting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) population responses to naturalistic movie stimuli and optimising the most exciting inputs (MEIs) to visualise RGCs' receptive field (RF) structures. We then optimized suppressive surrounds beyond classical RGC RF boundaries, intended to capture the inhibitory effect of wide-field ACs on RGC activity. These optimized surrounds reduced MEI-elicited activity by 10% to 30%, demonstrating that CNNs not only mimic retinal responses but can also reveal hidden computational aspects of wide-field inhibition. However, suppression strength and generalization varied across architectures and datasets, indicating potential model-specific effects, highlighting the importance of cautious interpretation. Overall, our approach illustrates how interpretability methods applied to artificial neural networks can offer new hypotheses regarding biological retinal computation, paving the way for targeted experimental validation.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Anomalous experiences are associated with high subconscious connectedness.",
    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Risk of postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with spontaneous intracranial hematoma stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus",
    "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

    "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

    "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

However, research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of acceptance, which may be related to instructions to accept different aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., thoughts vs. emotion). We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip.

Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
    "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "title": "Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms in Spanish individuals with nonpathological Alzheimer\u2019s disease biomarkers.",
    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05). Conclusions: Robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms may improve the detection of subtle cognitive decline, modestly enhancing sensitivity at the lower ends of distributions.

    "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptomatology rather than mild traumatic brain injury is related to atypical early neural processing during cognitive control.",
    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

    "content": "There are dream metaphors that express waking-life experiences indirectly. Animals in dreams have been speculated to be related to dream metaphors. Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Gaining insight into the factors associated with the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences is beneficial for achieving a comprehensive assessment of sexual mental health. The study will explore the relationship among personality traits, anxiety, depression, and sexual dream experiences based on the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay.

I wanted something lightweight, easy to use (exploratory), and something that would support numerical methods more easily. Hence, I created this lightweight wrapper that provides a hybrid symbolic-numerical interface to symbolic and numerical backends. It is backward compatible with Sympy.

I have also added additional numerical methods that neither SymPy nor SciPy have (Pade approximations, numerical roots, etc.).

    "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
    "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

    "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
    "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

    "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
    "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

    "title": "Akkermansia muciniphila in neurological disorders: mechanisms and therapeutic potential via the gut-brain axis",
    "content": "In recent years, the role of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in neurological diseases has attracted increasing attention. As a probiotic, A. muciniphila is closely associated with host health, metabolism, and immunity, demonstrating therapeutic potential in various conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and liver disorders. In the context of neurological diseases, A. muciniphila significantly influences the host brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA). This review summarizes the roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila and its active components (e.g., the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, extracellular vesicles AmEVs, and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs) in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), depression, cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy (EP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It exerts protective effects by enhancing the intestinal barrier, regulating lipid metabolism, producing SCFAs, secreting neuroactive substances, and inhibiting neuroinflammation, thereby suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders. However, due to limited data from large-scale human clinical trials and the complexity of disease mechanisms and host\u2013microbiota interactions, its clinical translation faces considerable challenges. Future efforts should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials and in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing technologies such as metabolomics to facilitate evidence-based clinical application.",

    "title": "Prognostic impact of collateral circulation in direct thrombectomy versus bridging thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion: a retrospective comparative study",
    "content": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the prognostic impact of collateral circulation on outcomes of direct thrombectomy (DT) versus bridging thrombectomy (BT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO).MethodThis retrospective study included 460 AIS patients with anterior circulation LVO who underwent either DT (n\u202f=\u202f220) or BT (n\u202f=\u202f240). Collateral status was assessed using multiphase computed tomographic angiography. The primary outcome was functional prognosis at 3\u202fmonths, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Prognostic factors for good prognosis (90-day mRS\u202f\u2264\u202f2) and adverse events were identified through multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.ResultsThe BT group had significantly higher rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation compared to the DT group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Good collateral circulation was independently associated with good prognosis and lower risk of serious adverse events (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lower NIHSS scores, shorter OTR, absence of atrial fibrillation, and lower serum BNP levels were also significantly associated with favorable outcomes in AIS patients (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Elevated serum BNP levels increased the risk of serious adverse events in both DT and BT groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ROC analysis showed that a combined model including NIHSS, BNP, collateral circulation, onset-to-reperfusion time, and atrial fibrillation achieved high predictive performance for good prognosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.907, 95% CI: 0.881\u20130.934, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).ConclusionCollateral circulation is a strong predictor of both functional recovery and risk of adverse events in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, regardless of treatment strategy. While serum BNP may offer additional prognostic value, its moderate performance and overlap with cardiovascular conditions suggest that it should be interpreted cautiously. Pre-intervention collateral assessment remains a valuable tool for guiding individualized treatment decisions.",

    "content": "ObjectiveAn early and accurate diagnosis of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody seropositive optic neuritis (MOG-ON) versus seronegative-ON is critical for optimal management. We aimed to explore alterations in static and dynamic functional networks for differentiation by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) with the graph theory method.MethodsRS-fMRI was performed on 53 patients (23 with MOG-ON and 30 with seronegative-ON) and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Graph theory analysis was used to investigate the topological properties of the functional networks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to determine their effectiveness in differential diagnosis.ResultsWith respect to static properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented a spectrum of abnormalities in global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Furthermore, compared with the seronegative-ON group, the MOG-ON group also presented with abnormal properties mostly located in the visual network (VN). With respect to dynamic properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented with greater variances of global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Importantly, the variances in several global and nodal properties were greater in the MOG-ON group. Compared with that in HCs, the subnetwork (24 nodes and 28 edges) in the MOG-ON patients was enhanced. For ROC analysis, the optimal diagnostic performance was obtained by combining static and dynamic approaches.ConclusionIn conclusion, abnormal topological organization of static and dynamic brain functional networks may help explore the neural mechanisms of ON in different phenotypes and serve as biomarkers for differentiation.",

    "title": "A review of the application of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of facial paralysis",
    "content": "Facial paralysis (FP), as a highly prevalent neurological dysfunction disease worldwide, has long faced challenges such as strong subjectivity in assessment and difficulty in quantifying therapeutic effects in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. Traditional scales rely on physicians\u2019 experience. Neuroelectrophysiological examinations are invasive, while imaging evaluations are costly. The rise of intelligent sensing technology provides a new path to break through these limitations. Intelligent sensing technology has significantly improved the accuracy of FP recognition and assessment through multi-modal data fusion and dynamic monitoring. Its clinical value is not only reflected in the improvement of diagnostic efficiency, but also in promoting a fundamental change in the diagnosis and treatment model of FP. The artificial intelligence-assisted analysis mainly focuses on using machine learning algorithms to conduct in-depth exploration and analysis of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals of patients with facial paralysis, the motion trajectory data obtained through three-dimensional (3D) motion capture, as well as the data from patients\u2019 self-assessment scales. This study systematically reviews the innovative applications of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of FP, focusing on three major technical directions: sEMG, 3D motion capture, and artificial intelligence assisted analysis.",

    "title": "Spike-based time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model for extremely low power VLSI implementation of multi-layer neural networks",
    "content": "In deep neural network (DNN) models, the weighted summation, or multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, is an essential and heavy calculation task, which leads to high power consumption in current digital processors. The use of analog operation in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is a promising method for achieving extremely low power-consumption operation for such calculation tasks. In this paper, a time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed, and two timings proportional to the positive and negative ones are produced, respectively, in each layer. The timings are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose VLSI circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS circuit to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights. Simulation results showed that the precision was above 4-bit, and the energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 237.7 Tera Operations Per Second Per Watt (TOPS/W), more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors. Our model promises to be a suitable approach for performing intensive in-memory computing (IMC) of DNNs with moderate precision very energy-efficiently while reducing the cost of analog-digital-converter (ADC) overhead.",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

    "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
    "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

    "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

    "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

You can even develop your own splitter using the Base object, and it is the same for the Readers!</p> <p>In addition, <strong>you can process the graphical resources of your documents (e.g., photos) using VLMs</strong> (OpenAI, Gemini, HuggingFace, etc.), so you can extract the text or caption them!</p> <h1>What\u2019s new / what\u2019s good in the latest release</h1> <ul> <li>Stable Version <strong>1.0.0</strong> is out.</li> <li>Supports <strong>more input formats / more robust readers</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Stable API</strong> for the Reader abstractions so you can plug in your own if needed.</li> <li><strong>Better handling of edge cases</strong> (e.g. images, schema\u2019d JSON / XML) so you don\u2019t lose structure unintentionally.</li> </ul> <h1>Some trade-offs / limitations (so you don\u2019t run into surprises)</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Heavy dependencies</strong>: because it supports all these formats you\u2019ll pull in a bunch of libs (PDF, Word, image parsing, etc.). If you only care about plain text, many of those won\u2019t matter, but still.</li> <li><strong>Not a fully \u201cLLM prompt manager\u201d or embedding chunker out of the box</strong> \u2014 splitting + parsing is its job; downstream you\u2019ll still need to decide chunk sizes, context windows, etc.</li> </ul> <h1>Installation and usage</h1> <p>If you want to test:</p> <pre><code>uv add splitter-mr </code></pre> <p>Example usage:</p> <pre><code>from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader from splitter_mr.model.models import AzureOpenAIVisionModel model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel() reader = VanillaReader(model=model) output = reader.read(file_path=&quot;data/sample_pdf.pdf&quot;) print(output.text) </code></pre> <p><strong>Check out the docs for more examples, API details, and instructions on how to write your own Reader for special formats:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR\">Github</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/\">Documentation server</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/splitter-mr/1.0.1/\">PyPi package</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-herencia\">LinkedIn (to contact with me)</a></li> </ul> <p>If you want to collaborate or you have some suggestions, don't dubt to contact me.</p> <p><strong>Thank you so much for reading :)</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Andreshere\"> /u/Andreshere </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ng2h8x/splittermr_a_modular_library_for_splitting/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "Diaphragm dysfunction represents a significant complication in elderly patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, often resulting in extended intensive care stays, unsuccessful weaning attempts, and increased healthcare expenditures. To address the deficiency of precise, real-time decision support in this context, a novel artificial intelligence framework is proposed, integrating imaging, physiological signals, and ventilator parameters. Initially, a hierarchical Transformer encoder is employed to extract modality-specific embeddings, followed by an attention-guided cross-modal fusion module and a temporal network for dynamic trend prediction. The framework was assessed using three public datasets, which are, the MIMIC-IV, eICU, and Chest X-ray. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3% on MIMIC-IV, 91.8% on eICU, 92.0% on Chest X-ray) and surpassed all baselines in precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, the model's probability estimates were well-calibrated, and its SHAP-based explainability analysis identified ventilator volume and key imaging features as primary predictors. The clinical implications of this study are significant. By providing precise and interpretable predictions, the proposed model has the potential to transform critical care practices by offering a pathway to more effective and personalized interventions for high-risk patients.",

    "content": "As global life expectancy rises, a growing proportion of the population is affected by dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Electroencephalography (EEG) based diagnosis presents a non-invasive, cost effective alternative for early detection, yet existing methods are challenged by data scarcity, inter-subject variability, and privacy concerns. This study proposes lightweight and privacy-preserving EEG classification framework combining deep learning and Federated Learning (FL). Five convolutional neural networks (EEGNetv1, EEGNetv4, EEGITNet, EEGInception, EEGInceptionERP) have been evaluated on resting-state EEG dataset comprising 88 subjects. EEG signals are preprocessed using band-pass (1\u201345 Hz) and notch filtering, followed by exponential standardization and 4-second windowing. EEGNetv4 outperformed among other EEG tailored models, and upon utilizing the hybrid fusion techniques it achieves 97.1% accuracy using only 1,609 parameters and less than 1 MB of memory, demonstrating high efficiency. Moreover, FL using FedAvg is implemented across five stratified clients, achieving 96.9% accuracy on the hybrid fused EEGNetV4 model while preserving data privacy. This work establishes a scalable, resource-efficient, and privacy-compliant framework for EEG-based dementia diagnosis, suitable for deployment in real-world clinical and edge-device settings.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

Previous studies have focused primarily on the correlation between patients' sleep structure and tinnitus, lacking exploration into the links between sleep problems and the underlying pathological mechanisms of tinnitus, such as thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD). Here, we present the first study on neural oscillatory patterns in patients with tinnitus during sleep spindles, a more...",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "title": "Social and non-social directional cues differentially orient attention by learned habit",
    "content": "IntroductionSince an early age, we are implicitly motivated to use the direction of eye gaze of others to learn about the environment, and we orient our attention in space based on this directional signal. Similarly, we orient our attention based on the direction of arrow signs. In both cases, the mechanisms underlying attentional orienting rely on the activity of brain areas involved in endogenous attention; however, orienting by gaze direction also relies on brain areas involved in exogenous attention.Research questionsTo date, it remains unclear whether the acquisition of attentional habit, which can also guide attention in ways that are not purely endogenous or exogenous, is similar for gaze and arrow or rather differs in some important way. We aimed to assess whether learning implicit regularities implemented with exogenous, arrow, and gaze stimuli guides attention in space.MethodsUsing the Posner paradigm, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments with exogenous, arrow, and gaze cues. Unbeknownst to participants, specific regularities, namely cue predictive validity and probability cueing, were implemented through blocks (baseline, learning, testing).Results and discussionThe findings showed that predictive validity alone is not sufficient to engender habitual attention for all types of cues. However, it becomes effective when combined with probability cueing. Importantly, a learned habit with gaze cues engenders unique effects on attention compared to other cues.ConclusionSocially relevant directional signals, such as gaze, can bias spatial attention more effectively than perceptual or non-social directional stimuli.",

    "title": "Gender differences in brain activity underlying acupuncture sensations at LR3: a task-based fMRI study",
    "content": "BackgroundAcupuncture has been practiced in China for centuries, and LR3 (Taichong) is a key acupoint of the liver meridian that has been widely studied. Whether its central mechanism differs by sex remains unclear, because earlier work used single-sex or mixed-sex samples without stratified analysis. To close this gap, we used task-based fMRI together with the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale to compare sex differences in brain activation and thalamic functional connectivity.MethodsWe enrolled 30 men and 25 women in a block-design acupuncture task, the modular task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was employed to investigate brain activity, and the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess acupuncture sensations experienced by the participants. Alterations in activated brain regions and functional connectivity were examined separately for males and females. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential gender differences in acupuncture sensation.ResultsSignificant statistical differences were observed in the 12 acupuncture sensation scores of the MASS scale (p < 0.001). Acupuncture LR3 activated the left inferior cerebellar gyrus, right superior margin gyrus, and left posterior central gyrus in women, and activated the right superior margin gyrus, left central sulcus, and right paracentral lobule in men. Enhanced functional connectivity was also observed in the bilateral thalamus of women: the bilateral caudate nucleus, right precuneus, right cuneate fissure, and bilateral lingular gyrus were highly active. Furthermore, the right thalami also demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity with the left cuneate fissure, right posterior cingulate gyrua, and left precuneu.ConclusionThe differences in the functional connectivity of the right superior marginal gyrus and thalamus between men and women may account for the differences in acupuncture sensory processing between men and women. In addition, the right superior marginal gyrus may be a specific brain region critical for activation of the LR3 acupoint.",

    "content": "IntroductionDyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by unilateral hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, severe epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While congenital DDMS is predominantly attributed to anterior circulation anomalies [e.g., internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) hypoplasia], posterior circulation involvement remains unreported. Here, we present the first documented case of congenital DDMS resulting from a rare combination of hypoplastic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral fetal-type posterior communicating artery (FTP).Case presentationA 19-year-old male exhibited atypical DDMS manifestations: absence seizures, preserved motor function, and occipitotemporal cognitive deficits (MoCA: 20/30). Neuroimaging revealed classic DDMS features. Angiography confirmed left PCA hypoplasia with FTP persistence, while CT perfusion demonstrated chronic left PCA hypoperfusion. Lamotrigine (100\u202fmg/day) and regular cognition rehabilitative training resulted in good symptom control.ConclusionThis case identifies PCA hypoplasia with FTP as a novel DDMS etiology, challenging the MCA/ICA-centric paradigm. The \u201cposterior phenotype\u201d (absence seizures, preserved motor function, occipitotemporal cognitive deficits) expands DDMS heterogeneity. Multimodal imaging (angiography/perfusion) is diagnostic gold-standard, while personalized therapy optimizes outcomes.",

However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days.

    "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

    "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%.

    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",
