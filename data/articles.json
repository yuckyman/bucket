This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "Working Memory Selectively Modulates Subjective Perception: A Pilot Study",
    "content": "This study aimed to investigate how working memory interacts with perception at the behavioral level. We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception. We hereby treat this preprint as a form of pre-registration, specifying our hypotheses, experimental designs, and analysis methods before examining whether the preliminary results will be confirmed in a larger sample.",

    "content": "Synaptic pruning by glial cells is critical for refining neural circuits, yet which glial populations mediate this process in hypothalamic networks controlling energy balance remains poorly understood. Here, using 3D-ultrastructural analyses and molecular approaches, we show that tanycytes, specialized glial cells lining the third ventricle, actively engulf excitatory synapses in the mediobasal hypothalamus during a defined postnatal window. This phagocytic activity relies on tanycytic MFG-E8 and phosphatidylserine exposure on synaptic elements. Disruption of this pathway reduces synapse uptake in vitro and alters body weight control around weaning and glucose homeostasis in adulthood. These findings identify tanycytes as previously unrecognized glial mediators of synaptic pruning in hypothalamic circuits, establishing their active role in shaping neural networks underlying energy balance.",

    "title": "Traces of parenthood but not pregnancy loss in UK Biobank structural brain MRI data",
    "content": "Pregnancy induces neuroanatomical changes in the human brain. Earlier studies detected traces of motherhood decades after childbirth. It is unclear whether these reflect persisting traces of pregnancy or effects of parenthood. We investigated effects of past birth and of pregnancy loss in women, and effects of fatherhood in men, using univariate and machine learning analyses on 205 regional brain volumes. A group of mothers and an age-matched sample of nulliparous women (N=4357 per group, mean age 63 years) from the UK Biobank, with no past pregnancy losses, showed significant volumetric group differences in 14 regions at Bonferroni-adjusted =.05. Likewise, we identified 18 significant group differences between age-matched samples of fathers and non-fathers of the same size (mean age 63.4), with 9 regions overlapping between sexes. Brain-wide association statistics for past live birth in mothers and those for fatherhood correlated (r = 0.55). XGBoost machine learning models trained to classify parenthood status separately in both datasets showed performance that was low, but significantly above chance (10-fold cross validation: AUC=0.56, p<1e-5 Motherhood classifier, AUC=0.54, p<1e-5, Fatherhood classifier, 10k permutations). We tested the motherhood classification model on an independent test sample comprising of four age-matched groups: 1. women who have never been pregnant, 2. women with past pregnancy loss but no live births, 3. women with live births but no pregnancy loss, and 4. women who experienced both. Class probability was significantly associated with live births, but not past loss. These findings may suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of past childbirth partly also reflect traces of parenthood and not solely persisting traces of past pregnancy, although a more detailed characterization of pregnancy loss data would be needed for full confirmation of this interpretation. Therefore, further research is needed to quantify the extent and understand the nature of these changes, particularly considering the known vulnerability for mental disorders associated with reproductive events.",

    "title": "Inherited retinal degenerations: PARP regulates calpain activation via TRPM2 channels in rd1 mouse photoreceptors",
    "content": "Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) refers to untreatable blinding diseases characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss. Photoreceptor degeneration is often associated with an excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. To explore the interplay between PARP and calpain activity, we employed organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice and from the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Retinae were treated with the PARP inhibitors INO1001 or Olaparib, the poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor JA2131, or the transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) blocker 8-Br-ADPR. Readouts included the TUNEL assay to detect cell death, in situ activity assays for histone-deacetylases (HDAC), PARP, and calpain, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP, PARG, and TRPM2 inhibition reduced calpain activity and calpain-2 activation. PARP activity was decreased by PARP and TRPM2 inhibitors but not by PARG inhibition. Remarkably, the PARP inhibitor INO1001 increased HDAC activity unlike any of the other compounds. When combined with the PARG inhibitor JA2131, INO1001 reduced photoreceptor cell death in a synergistic fashion, although such synergy was not observed for calpain or PARP activity. Moreover, synergistic photoreceptor preservation was not observed when JA2131 was combined with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Overall, these results indicate that in rd1 photoreceptors, PARP controls calpain activity via PARG and TRPM2-induced Ca2+ influx. We also characterize INO1001 as potentially more beneficial for IRD treatment than Olaparib. Our study details the complexity of PARP-signalling in photoreceptors and identifies PARG and TRPM2 as new targets for IRD therapy development.",

    "title": "Predictive Networks Generate Motion-Induced Color Illusions",
    "content": "Subjective color (SC) refers to chromatic perception induced by achromatic stimuli, as classically demonstrated using Benham's top. Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham's top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors.

    "title": "Context-dependent benefits of training and reminders in visual skill learning",
    "content": "Previous studies using a visual texture discrimination task (TDT) have demonstrated that performance enhancements resulting from extensive daily training (full training condition) remained intact after replacing all training, except for the first and last session, with a few daily reminder trials (reminder condition). Omitting reminders (control condition) yielded only limited learning, supporting their crucial contribution. We first confirmed these findings and excluded gaze position differences among conditions as a contributing factor. Next, we tested whether the reminders effectiveness is specific to a context of limited attention to the peripheral target caused by simultaneously performing a demanding fixation task. Removing the fixation task yielded performance levels in the first session matching those normally reached after lengthy daily training, suggesting that learning in the standard TDT involves the redeployment of attention. After changing texture parameters to increase the difficulty of the task, performing the TDT without a fixation task yielded learning in all three conditions. This indicates that in a dual-task, reminders can produce learning outcomes comparable to full training. In contrast, when the TDT is performed with full attention to the target, consolidation of the initial session alone can yield improvements equivalent to those observed in reminder and full training conditions.",

    "title": "MyeliMAP: Studying Oligodendrocyte Function in Brain Networks",
    "content": "Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system (CNS), essential for rapid signal propagation, metabolic support, and neuronal health. While rodent-based cultures and organoid systems have provided insights into oligodendrocyte biology, they fall short of capturing human-specific features of myelination or integrating structural and functional readouts. Here, we present MyeliMAP (Myelination MAPping), a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived microphysiological and electrophysiological platform that enables robust modeling of CNS myelination. The system combines inducible hPSC-derived neurons and oligodendrocytes in a custom-engineered microfluidic microstructure designed to mimic the developing brain microenvironment, promoting spatially organized axon-glia interactions and controlled myelin sheath formation. Within six weeks, we demonstrate myelin formation and maturation by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural validation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming compact multilayered wrapping of human axons. Importantly, the microstructure is directly integrated with a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA), enabling real-time, long-term functional assessment of network activity and myelin-dependent changes in signal conduction. This allowed us to demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-based myelinated neurons display enhanced conduction velocity of action potentials compared to neuron monocultures. Moreover, the presence of oligodendrocytes stabilized the temporal neuronal network activity by reducing variability in firing patterns and enhancing synchrony across the culture. This dual structure-function approach surpasses static end-point analyses by coupling morphological validation with dynamic, quantitative measurements of maturing circuit physiology. MyeliMAP provides a reproducible, human-relevant platform to dissect neuron-glia interactions and accelerate discovery of remyelination-promoting strategies for CNS disease.",

    "content": "Research utilising exercise therapeutically to enhance neuroplasticity mainly reports enhanced expression of neurotrophic (neural growth) factors which are associated with increased neurogenesis, structural changes, and improved memory. However, these neural changes are tightly regulated by both promotors and inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and the effect of exercise on inhibitory pathways is currently understudied. We show that exercise also modulates inhibitors of neuroplasticity. Six weeks of treadmill training reduced the gene expression of aggrecan, a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG), and altered the composition of CSPG containing structures, perineuronal nets, in the rodent hippocampus. Genetically manipulating chondroitin-4-sulphation of CSPGs by overexpressing hippocampal Chst11 impaired memory performance, which was mitigated by treadmill training. We provide evidence that hippocampal CSPGs are involved in object recognition memory, and that there is a link between exercise, modulating hippocampal inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and memory performance.",

Historically, aberrant empathy was considered as major characteristics of autistic individuals but recently it has been challenged. It required mechanistic understanding of the empathy process, especially how autistic individual percept other emotion. By evaluating the social fear transfer response, we reported a critical role of Shank3 gene, one of the most replicated causative autism genes, in cortico-amygdala circuit in balancing and integrating affective empathy process using preclinical mouse models. We found that Shank3 knock-out mouse exhibited unexpected exaggerated affective responses, which was encoded by defective neural dynamics of Shank3-deficient cingulate projecting amygdala circuit. This work for the first time showcased an interplay between gene and affective empathy responses in mouse and laid the groundwork for modeling emapthy in autism and other neuropsychiatric disease.",

    "content": "Gq signaling through Trio RhoGEF and Phospholipase C effectors promotes neurotransmitter release at synapses. Whether activated Rho and Phospholipase C signaling acts through shared or independent pathways remains unclear. We use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans, which is regulated positively by Gq signaling and negatively by Go signaling, to determine the role of Rho GTPase in G-protein regulation of neural circuit excitability. We previously showed that Trio signals in both the presynaptic Hermaphrodite-Specific command Neurons (HSNs) and the postsynaptic egg-laying vulval muscles they innervate to promote egg laying. Here we show that its effector Rho similarly signals both pre- and post-synaptically. Expression of constitutively active Rho-1(G14V) in either the HSNs or vulval muscles increased their Ca2+ activity and stimulated egg laying. Conversely, reducing Rho signaling in the HSNs via expression of Rho-1(T19N) or C3 transferase expression inhibited HSN Ca2+ activity and egg laying. Animals lacking Rho function in HSN still had vulval muscle Ca2+ activity that supported contraction and egg release, although this Ca2+ activity lacked the enhancement associated with HSN neurotransmitter release, suggesting it was largely driven by stretch-dependent feedback. Together, these results show that Rho signals in both the HSNs and vulval muscles to promote excitability and egg laying.",

    "content": "Memory expression fluctuates even in response to identical cues, suggesting that ongoing brain states bias memory accessibility. However, the cellular and circuit principles governing these state-dependent fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous pre-cue activity of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) modulates the expression of reward-associative memory in mice. TMN histaminergic activity exhibited infraslow dynamics (0.05-0.1 Hz) that closely tracked an integrated brain-body state. Closed-loop cue delivery during high histaminergic states enhanced memory expression. Brief optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons before the cue bidirectionally modulated memory expression, and direct activation of histaminergic terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to enhance memory expression. Furthermore, histaminergic inhibition before the cue impaired the cue-evoked BLA population response. Thus, ongoing histaminergic activity exerts an infraslow, state-setting influence that primes BLA circuits for robust cue responses, and in turn, modulates moment-to-moment memory accessibility.",

    "title": "Decoding hidden goal-directed navigational states and their neuronal representations using a novel labyrinth paradigm and probabilistic modeling framework",
    "content": "Goal-directed navigation involves a sequence of planned actions aimed at achieving long-term goals through reinforcement, but detecting hidden states that support this process and their neuronal substrates remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we developed a complex labyrinth test that mimics naturalistic foraging and implemented a novel hierarchical probabilistic modeling framework, Cognitive Mapping of Planned Actions with State Spaces (CoMPASS). This framework infers a nested state structure, comprising short-term surveillance and ambulation states (Level 1) and long-term goal-oriented navigational states (Level 2). Using CoMPASS, we show that successful navigation in wild-type mice is marked by increased recruitment of both surveillance and goal-oriented states specifically at decision nodes, revealing how sequential behavioral decisions culminate in long-term goals. In contrast, the humanized AppSAA mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited navigational impairments marked by diminished surveillance during decisions, reduced goal-directed states, and increased navigation stochasticity. Importantly, we show that gamma oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved in spatial navigation planning, encode these CoMPASS behavioral states and their dynamic operating modes linking spatial locations to long-term goals. Our findings provide a novel paradigm for assessing hidden goal-directed navigational states and identify gamma oscillations in the PPC as their neural substrates.",

    "title": "Simultaneous stomach-brain electrophysiology reveals dynamic coupling in human sleep",
    "content": "Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral signals during human sleep remain poorly understood. Here we tested whether gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms indicative of sleep physiology. Simultaneous high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and electrogastrography (EGG) were recorded across sixty participants and three nights. Gastric power was consistently higher during NREM than REM sleep and declined across successive cycles, consistent with stage-dependent autonomic modulation of visceral activity. For the first time, we show that the gastric rhythm itself exhibits intrinsic infraslow amplitude modulations (~0.007 Hz), which are selectively amplified during NREM sleep and temporally aligned with infraslow fluctuations in cortical sigma power, strongest during N3 sleep. Event-locked analyses further revealed transient increases in gastric amplitude following cortical slow wave oscillations, particularly when accompanied by sleep spindles. Across nights, variance in gastric infraslow amplitude predicted subjective sleep quality beyond standard polysomnographic and cardiac measures. Together, these findings position the human stomach as a peripheral oscillator whose infraslow dynamics track thalamocortical activity during sleep and predict subjective sleep quality, extending the interoceptive regulatory loop into the sleeping brain.",

    "content": "A central challenge in overcoming diseases resulting from defects in the cellular nanoscale multiprotein porosome complexes, is the consequent alteration of other proteins within the complex. By exploiting the distinct porosomes present in different tissues, Porosome Therapeutics, Inc., has developed a clinically relevant approach to incorporate (reconstitute) functional wild type porosomes into the plasma membrane of diseased cells to overcome secretory defects. In a combinatorial strategy of reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic components, we established a dual-target therapeutic framework that repairs synaptic and metabolic defects to counteract neurodegeneration in Alzheimers. Utilizing iPSC derived human brain organoids, as recommended by the NIH and FDA, we demonstrate both the morphological and functional reversal of Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin treatment. Using the UHD-CMOS-MEA System developed jointly by Sony Semiconductor Solutions (Sony), SCREEN Holdings (SCREEN) and VitroVo, we were able to monitor thousands of neuronal firing in the brain organoids, helping in assessing the restoration of neuronal function in Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin therapy.",

    "content": "Neuronal populations in primary visual cortex adjust their responses to the statistical structure of the environment, including both stimulus contrast and the probability of occurrence of visual patterns. Here we show that, across a wide range of adaptation states, the distribution of population responses is well described by a zero-inflated log-normal model with three parameters: the probability of \"silence\" P0, the log-response mean , and its variance {sigma}2. Adaptation produces coordinated changes in P0 and , whereas {sigma}2 remains approximately invariant. These coordinated shifts collapse the family of response distributions onto a one-dimensional manifold, consistent with the existence of a common gain mechanism underlying both contrast and pattern adaptation. We further demonstrate that  obeys power-law relationships with stimulus contrast and with orientation probability, and that P0 varies linearly with . Finally, we show that these empirical relations arise naturally in a population of linear-nonlinear neurons driven by Gaussian inputs whose mean, but not variance, is modulated by the environment. Together, these results suggest that contrast and pattern adaptation rely on a shared mechanism that adjusts the mean input to cortical populations while preserving the overall structure of their response distribution.",

    "title": "The retinal light response is modulated by an mGluR5-mediated retrograde signal from ON-bipolar cells to photoreceptors",
    "content": "The ON visual pathway is initiated by the deactivation of mGluR6, coupled to the opening of TRPM1 channels in retinal ON-bipolar cell dendrites. Here, we show that a second metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is localized with TRPM1 and mGluR6 in the dendrites of ON-bipolar cells. To examine the function of mGluR5, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that the amplitude of the b-wave, which is primarily a measure of ON-bipolar cell light-driven activity, is reduced in mGluR5 knock-out mice compared to wild type. In the mGluR5-/- retina, we observed weaker mGluR6 immunofluorescence in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells that could explain the smaller ERG b-wave. To observe the effect of mGluR5 without perturbing mGluR6 expression, wild type mice were injected with MTEP, an allosteric antagonist of mGluR5. MTEP increased the amplitude of the b-wave in response to dim stimuli and caused an inflection in the intensity-response plot for flashes in the mesopic range. In the brain, postsynaptic mGluR5 regulates presynaptic glutamate release via endocanabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Therefore, we tested the effect of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR1417A, on the ERG and found that the b-wave was affected as by MTEP, including an inflection in the intensity-response. We further showed that the CB1 receptor agonist, ACEA, reversed the effects of MTEP. Together, our results indicate that mGluR5 plays a role in gain-control at the photoreceptor to ON-bipolar cell synapses, likely via an endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde feedback.",

    "title": "Identification of gingipains in glioblastoma tumors and evidence that P. gingivalis infection drives IL-6 and PD-L1 expression in glioma cells",
    "content": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor that accounts for approximately 60% of all gliomas and 48% of primary central nervous system malignancies, is incurable and poorly understood, with a median survival of only 15 months after diagnosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand GBM pathogenesis in order to develop an effective treatment. Recent research has revealed frequent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brains of patients with GBM, i.e., amyloid beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), indicating that GBM and AD may share some unknown environmental risk. Since chronic periodontitis (CP), and specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone bacterial pathogen in CP, have emerged as risk factors for both AD and GBM, we investigated whether P. gingivalis gingipain virulence factors could be identified in GBM tissue samples and whether P. gingivalis infection affects glioma cell behavior. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (70 GBM cores from 35 patients; 34 cerebral tissue cores from 17 patients), we quantified the presence of arginine-gingipain B (RgpB) and lysine-gingipain (Kgp) antigens. Both gingipains showed significantly elevated staining in GBM samples compared to controls (**p < .01, ****p < .0001, respectively), with Kgp levels notably higher than RgpB within GBM tissue (****p < .0001). In functional assays using U251 glioma cells, P. gingivalis infection induced robust, dose-dependent IL-6 secretion (peaking at MOI 5), increased PD-L1 expression by 30% (*p = .036), and significantly enhanced cell invasiveness (**p < .01) in a viability-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that P. gingivalis gingipains are present at elevated levels in GBM tissue and that P. gingivalis infection reprograms glioma cells to adopt an immunosuppressive, invasive phenotype through upregulation of the IL-6/PD-L1 axis, suggesting a potential microbial contribution to GBM pathogenesis and immune evasion.",

    "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Assumption Lean Community Detection Methods for Human Connectome Networks",
    "content": "Community detection provides a principled lens on mesoscale organization in functional brain networks, yet many widely used methods presume assortative structure and depend on arbitrary thresholding, which complicates the selection of the community count K. We conducted a systematic benchmark of three assumption lean approaches that operate directly on weighted functional connectivity matrices: the Weighted Stochastic Block Model, Spectral Clustering, and K-means. Performance was assessed on synthetic networks with known ground truth and on three neuroimaging cohorts spanning development, namely the Human Connectome Project, Washington University 120, and the Baby Connectome Project. We compared strategies for choosing K, including post hoc indices such as silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C index, modularity, variation of information, Normalized Mutual Information, and zRand, together with a likelihood-based criterion for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model that uses bootstrap confidence intervals for differences in log likelihood between successive values of K. In simulations all methods recovered stable partitions, but the post hoc indices favored incorrect values of K under weak signal and nonassortative mixing. In adult datasets the indices do not yield a unique optimum, whereas the likelihood-based criterion selects a parsimonious range centered near K=11, which is consistent with established sensory and association systems. In infants and toddlers, the same procedure supports a larger K around 15 and reveals developmentally distinct mesoscale architecture, including anterior and posterior subdivisions within default mode and fronto parietal systems. A consensus relabeling scheme based on Hungarian matching with Hamming distance further stabilizes solutions across runs and across values of K. Overall, threshold free weighted methods mitigate assortative bias and the likelihood-based comparison provides a reproducible path to selecting K.",

    "title": "Toward Understanding the Role of Visual Hierarchy in Flicker-induced Time Dilation: A Preregistered Study",
    "content": "When a temporal interval is marked by flickering stimuli, its subjective duration is overestimated. The cortical origin of this temporal illusion, termed flicker-induced time dilation (FITD), is not yet well understood. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to explore whether the higher-level regions of ventral visual stream contribute to FITD. By using the semantic wavelet-induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) technique, four experimental conditions were created. Luminance and semantic flickers were created to selectively target the lower- and higher-level regions of the visual hierarchy, respectively. A combined luminance and semantic flicker condition was additionally created to probe the effect of simultaneous entrainment of lower- and higher-level visual regions on FITD. Lastly, to account for the single-pixel modulations and ripple-like motions induced by SWIFT, a control scramble condition was included. The phase-clustering analysis (N = 20) confirmed that the control scramble condition did not result in neural entrainment, whereas the flicker conditions showed entrainment whose magnitude and topography were consistent with their respective experimental manipulations. Nonetheless, the behavioral results indicated that the time dilation effect was not modulated by the flickering conditions neither was its magnitude correlated with the size of entrained oscillations. Moreover, the SWIFT scrambles led to a time dilation effect which was comparable to the flickering conditions. We discussed that while our results are not in agreement with neural entrainment account of FITD, they are not in agreement with the processing principles definition of salience either. Based on the putative shared cortical sources of SWIFT scrambles and luminance-modulated flickers, we conjectured that FITD, and motion-induced time dilation may rely on the same mechanism based on activation of motion sensitive regions. Finally, our results indicated that, at least at the presence of steadily activated lower-level visual and/or motion sensitive areas, periodic activation of ventral stream does not contribute to FITD.",

    "title": "The DNA methylation enzymatic machinery in substance use disorders: a systematic review",
    "content": "Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronic affections defined by similar symptoms across a variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or methamphetamine. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent key candidates to help explain the long-lasting effect of these drugs, as well as inter-individual variation in vulnerability. Here, we systematically reviewed current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation and the related enzymatic machinery in rodent models of SUD. Using a prospectively registered methodology, 99 articles were prioritized. A first set of studies manipulated the expression or activity of methylation or demethylation pathways. Depending on the brain region or drug considered, SUD-related behavioral and molecular manifestations were bidirectionally modulated, suggesting both pathogenic and protective roles for drug-induced methylomic plasticity. A second set of articles focused on candidate genes. Although significant heterogeneity across experimental models, brain regions or gene targets resulted in an absence of replicated findings, available data nevertheless support the notion that drugs of abuse trigger DNA methylation changes at discrete loci. Third, recent genome-wide studies have started to demonstrate that these drugs recruit widespread reprogramming. Strikingly, most adaptations occur outside promoter regions, highlighting an important challenge toward their functional interpretation. Finally, studies of drug exposure during gestation or adolescence suggest long-lasting consequences, with the potential for early intervention.",

    "title": "Show HN: Chirp \u2013 Local Windows dictation with ParakeetV3 no executable required",
    "content": "<p>I\u2019ve been working in fairly locked\u2011down Windows environments where I\u2019m allowed to run Python, but not install or launch new `.exe` files. In addition the built-in windows dictations are blocked (the only good one isn't local anyway). At the same time, I really wanted accurate, fast dictation without sending audio to a cloud service, and without needing a GPU. Most speech\u2011to\u2011text setups I tried either required special launchers, GPU access, or were awkward to run day\u2011to\u2011day.<p>To scratch that itch, I built Chirp, a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally, uses NVIDIA\u2019s ParakeetV3 model, and is managed end\u2011to\u2011end with `uv`. If you can run Python on your machine, you should be able to run Chirp\u2014no additional executables required.<p>Under the hood, Chirp uses the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 ONNX bundle. ParakeetV3 has accuracy in the same ballpark as Whisper\u2011large\u2011v3 (multilingual WER ~4.9 vs ~5.0 in the open ASR leaderboard), but it\u2019s much faster and happy on CPU.<p>The flow is:\n- One\u2011time setup that downloads and prepares the ONNX model:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.setup`\n- A long\u2011running CLI process:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.main`\n- A global hotkey that starts/stops recording and injects text into the active window.<p>A few details that might be interesting technically:<p>- <i>Local\u2011only STT:</i> Everything runs on your machine using ONNX Runtime; by default it uses CPU providers, with optional GPU providers if your environment allows.<p>- <i>Config\u2011driven behavior:</i> A `config.toml` file controls the global hotkey, model choice, quantization (`int8` option), language, ONNX providers, and threading. There\u2019s also a simple `[word_overrides]` map so you can fix tokens that the model consistently mishears.<p>- <i>Post\u2011processing pipeline:</i> After recognition, there\u2019s an optional \u201cstyle guide\u201d step where you can specify prompts like \u201csentence case\u201d or \u201cprepend: >>\u201d for the final text.<p>- <i>No clipboard gymnastics required on Windows:</i> The app types directly into the focused window; there are options for clipboard\u2011based pasting and cleanup behavior for platforms where that makes more sense.<p>- <i>Audio feedback:</i> Start/stop sounds (configurable) let you know when the mic is actually recording.<p>So far I\u2019ve mainly tested this on my own Windows machines with English dictation and CPU\u2011only setups. There are probably plenty of rough edges (different keyboard layouts, language settings, corporate IT policies, etc.), and I\u2019d love feedback from people who:<p>- Work in restricted corporate environments and need local dictation.\n- Have experience with Parakeet/Whisper or ONNX Runtime and see obvious ways to improve performance or robustness.\n- Want specific features (e.g., better multi\u2011language support, more advanced post\u2011processing, or integrations with their editor/IDE).<p>Repo is here:  \n`<a href=\"https://github.com/Whamp/chirp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Whamp/chirp</a>`<p>If you try it, I\u2019d be very interested in:<p>- CPU usage and latency on your hardware,\n- How well it behaves with your keyboard layout and applications,\n- Any weird failure cases or usability annoyances you run into.<p>Happy to answer questions and dig into technical details in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45930659\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45930659</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "title": "Contrasting behavioral and physiological effects of Gtf2i duplication and deletion in mouse models of the 7q11.23 Duplication and Williams-Beuren Syndromes",
    "content": "7q11.23 Microduplication Syndrome (7Dup) and Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) are two ASD-related syndromes characterized by both common and contrasting symptoms, caused by either duplication or deletion of a 1.5-1.8 Mb segment in section q11.23 of Human chromosome 7, respectively. Notably, WBS patients show reduced social fear and are considered hyper-social, while 7Dup patients suffer from social anxiety and withdrawal. Previous work suggests that the GTF2I gene, one of the genes included in this segment, has a major role in the social symptoms of both syndromes. Here, we combine video and thermal imaging in multiple social behavior tests to screen for behavioral and physiological variables showing variations in mice models with either a duplication (Gtf2i+/dup) or a deletion (Gtf2i+/del) of the gene. Our analyses of social behavior, micturition, and defecation patterns identify several differences between wild-type and mutant littermates, some of which show contrasting variations associated with Gtf2i dosage. Interestingly, thermal imaging revealed that Gtf2i dosage dictates the mice's surface temperature profile during the tests, with Gtf2i(+/dup) males exhibiting higher surface temperature than their wild-type littermates, while Gtf2i(+/del) males and females show the opposite tendency. These results suggest that the two mouse models exhibit opposite changes in either their emotional state or thermoregulation capabilities, in correlation with Gtf2i dosage.",

    "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "ADHD Medications and Preadolescent Brain Structure: Patterns of Cortical Attenuation from the ABCD Study",
    "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the U.S., and the stimulant and nonstimulant medications used to treat ADHD are among the most widely prescribed treatments in youth. Stimulants--including amphetamine-based (AMP) and methylphenidate-based (MPH) medications--act primarily on dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, while nonstimulants (NS) more selectively target noradrenergic pathways. Although pharmacotherapy is the most clinically effective treatment, its neurostructural effects remain poorly understood. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study(R)), we used a machine learning approach to identify neuroanatomical targets of medications, followed by linear mixed-effects modeling to estimate the effects of ADHD status and medication class (AMP, MPH, NS) on cortical thickness, surface area, and cortical and subcortical volumes. ADHD was not associated with statistically significant differences; however, a consistent pattern emerged in which AMP and MPH effects attenuated ADHD effects, suggesting that stimulant medications may attenuate ADHD-related cortical patterns. NS medications showed a similar, albeit weaker, effect pattern. Notably, AMP and/or MPH use was associated with significant effects in the right entorhinal cortex and the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus, potentially reflecting overcompensatory effects, as well as in the left posterior cingulate, possibly indicating de novo medication-related differences.",

    "title": "Single nuclear RNA sequencing shows altered microglial and astrocytic functions in post-mortem Parkinson's disease tissue",
    "content": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and formation of misfolded protein aggregates. A growing body of research has implicated glial cell dysfunction in PD etiology, including the concentration of activated glial cells around protein aggregates in post-mortem tissue. Disruptions in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response functions of the microglia and astrocytes is believed to contribute towards neurons being lost as the disease progresses. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To shed light on the role of inflammation in PD, this study analyses two public single nuclear RNA sequencing datasets of the SNpc from patient and control postmortem brain to identify altered molecular pathways in PD-associated microglia and astrocytes. Results: The results show that both cell types have a significant upregulation in heat shock binding and misfolded protein response pathways, likely in response to the accumulation of protein aggregates. Microglia annotated with the MKI67 marker gene show a decreased expression in PD patient derived tissue. Markers associated with activated/reactivated states in astrocytes and microglia are upregulated in PD samples. Notably, expression of genes associated with resting state microglia and non-inflammatory reactive state microglia are downregulated in PD microglia, including P2RY12, CSF1R, CSF2RA, CSF3R, and TGFBR1. Concurrently, genes associated with activated microglial states such as HSP90AB1 and GPNMB are upregulated. Among the top downregulated functions, genes associated with ion channel functions are downregulated in both astrocytes and microglia. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings imply that astrocytes and microglia respond to protein misfolding pathology in PD by upregulating chaperone protein folding functions. Additionally, the profile of upregulated genes implies that pathways responding to oxidative stress are also activated. The downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in PD microglia paired with the upregulation of misfolding protein response pathways, suggests a switch from immune receptor functions to protein aggregate clearance by the end of disease stages. Finally, GPNMB emerged as a potential target for therapeutic intervention, as the one primary non-HSP gene that is significantly increased in PD-associated microglia.",

However, existing TLR2-targeting antibody therapies are limited by poor delivery to the central nervous system and short-lived efficacy. We developed a non-viral gene therapy strategy using biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver recombinant anti-TLR2 antibody genes. High-affinity nanobody and single-chain variable fragment candidates were selected through phage display screening and shown to suppress TLR2-dependent signaling both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of neuropathic pain, a single intrathecal administration of PLGA NP-encapsulated antibody genes produced robust and sustained analgesia, accompanied by reduced glial activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. These findings demonstrate a modular NP-based platform for sustained antibody expression in the central nervous system and establish its potential for the treatment of chronic pain driven by innate immune activation.",

    "title": "Exclusive ipsilateral representation of sequential tactile differences challenges contralateral dominance",
    "content": "Tactile perception is traditionally attributed to contralateral somatosensory (S1) processing, yet the functional role of ipsilateral S1 in human tactile discrimination remains unclear. Using fMRI during a sequential vibrotactile discrimination task, we examined how frequency information is represented when participants judged which of two successive stimuli delivered to the same fingertip was higher in frequency. Contralateral S1 showed robust activation, and ipsilateral S1 showed suppression during unilateral stimulation; however, linear mixed-effects analyses revealed reliable frequency-dependent modulation in ipsilateral S1, which was absent when no comparison was required. Multivariate representational analyses further demonstrated that fMRI activity patterns representing the differences between successive stimuli were strengthened under memory demands, particularly within ipsilateral S1 and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the representational separability predicted individual discrimination accuracy. The exclusive representation in the ipsilateral S1 was not hand-specific; that is, the results were consistent for both hands, indicating a bilateral and symmetric encoding scheme. These surprising findings demonstrate that the ipsilateral, not contralateral, S1 contributes to tactile discrimination, challenging classic contralateral models of somatosensory processing. These unprecedented findings highlight interhemispheric coordination as a key mechanism underlying perceptual decisions.",

    "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
    "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "title": "TSLNet: a hierarchical multi-head attention-enabled two-stream LSTM network for accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition",
    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "The time-varying brain: a comprehensive review of dynamic functional connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG",
    "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

    "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",

    "content": "Brain network modeling uses computer simulations to infer about latent neural properties at micro- and mesoscales by fitting brain dynamic models to empirical data of individual subjects or groups. However, computational costs of (individualized) model fitting is a major bottleneck, limiting the practical feasibility of this approach to larger cohorts and more complex models, and highlighting the need for scalable simulation implementations. Here, we introduce cuBNM, a Python package which leverages parallel processing of graphics processing units to massively accelerate simulations of brain network models. We show running simulations on graphics processing units is several hundred times faster compared to central processing units. We demonstrate the usage of cuBNM by running optimization of group-level and individualized low- and high-dimensional models. As examples of the utility of individualized models, we investigated test-retest reliability and heritability of simulated and empirical measures in the Human Connectome Project dataset, and found simulated features to be fairly reliable and heritable. Overall, cuBNM provides an efficient framework for large-scale simulations of brain network models, facilitating investigations of latent neural processes across larger cohorts, denser networks, and higher-dimensional models, which were previously less feasible in practice.",

    "content": "Accurate targeting of specific brain regions through non-invasive methods has long been a major goal of basic and translational neuroscience. Systemic delivery of AAVs expressing highly region- and cell-type-specific regulatory elements (enhancer-AAVs) continues to emerge as a tractable solution. Here we performed an independent characterization of a novel enhancer element with apparent robust transgene expression in fast-spiking basket cell interneurons in mouse hippocampus. Surprisingly, this vector did not induce expression in other brain regions harboring the same neuron class. Following intravenous administration in mice, robust labeling of FS-BCs across all hippocampal subfields was observed. We validated the FS-BC specificity in hippocampus using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings. Viral labeling was confined to parvalbumin-positive cells exhibiting basket cell morphology and fast-spiking responses. This approach represents a promising avenue for both mechanistic investigation of hippocampal circuit function and potential therapeutic interventions targeting hippocampal pathophysiologies such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders in mice and potentially other species.",

    "content": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a central large-scale brain network implicated in a range of cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Studying the DMN's complex dynamics in animal models provides invaluable insights into its function in both healthy and pathological states. However, performing a stable, long-term, and large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the multiple, deep, and distributed nodes of the DMN in awake, behaving mice has been a significant challenge. Here, we present a novel, two-phase surgical protocol developed to create a large (4x7.6 mm), durable, and resealable cranial window in mice. The procedure is designed to preserve the integrity of the dura mater, which is paramount for long-term brain health and recording stability. This window facilitates repeated, longitudinal recordings from over 1,000 electrodes simultaneously by combining surface-level micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) with two high-density intracranial electrode probes, allowing unprecedented access to the DMN. This technique provides a robust platform for multi-modal, multi-scale interrogation of network-wide electrophysiological dynamics over several weeks, opening new avenues for investigating the neuroplastic changes underlying the pathophysiology of brain disorders and for evaluating the chronic effects of novel therapeutics.",

    "content": "Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) triggers brain injury and systemic changes, including gut dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction (IBD), and bacterial translocation (BT). Although larger infarcts are associated with higher infection risk, it is unclear whether lesion size directly influences gut barrier integrity or bacterial dissemination. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) proximally or distally to generate large or small infarcts. Seventy two hours post ischemia, infarct volume was measured by MRI, and BT was assessed in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs. ZO1 and MMP9 expression were used to evaluate intestinal barrier integrity. Peripheral and central inflammation were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: Proximal MCAO produced larger infarcts than distal MCAO. The proportion of animals exhibiting BT was lower in distal MCAO, but this difference was not statistically significant. ZO1 expression did not differ between groups, while MMP9 was increased only in animals with BT, independent of infarct size. BT was associated with more pronounced lymphopenia and enhanced microglial activation and T cell infiltration in the brain. The composition of translocated bacteria was similar across groups. Conclusions: Infarct size alone does not determine IBD or BT, although BT is linked to intestinal and cerebral inflammation. This study evaluates for the first time the effect of lesion magnitude on IBD and BT, highlighting the complex interplay between cerebral injury and gut systemic interactions.",

    "title": "Aesthetics, illusion of success and age interactions: disentangling effects in the closed-loop design with sham neurofeedback training",
    "content": "This study examined the influence of the aesthetics of visual feedback stimuli in neurofeedback training (NFB). Previous research shows a lack of specific design standards in NFB research and its application. Beyond limited literature on continuous and intermittent feedback presentation effects, most NFB design parameters remain largely understudied. Studies in the context of interface design has pointed at possible effects of aesthetics and task difficulty, indicating an interaction effect of aesthetics on performance and perseverance in difficult task conditions. The study at hand evaluates whether similar effects emerge in the context of NFB. In order to address this question, aesthetics and NFB illusion of success were manipulated experimentally in a sham NFB study (N = 24) following a 2 \u00d7 2 within-subjects design. The main dependent variables were perseverance behavior, subjective workload, motivation, and EEG activity. Results indicated an interaction between pleasing design, illusion of success, and participant age affecting perseverance and physical demand. Alpha-1 band amplitudes were modulated by an interaction between pleasing design and age, and a main effect of the illusion of success emerged. Surprisingly, only the illusion of success variable appeared to exert a meaningful influence on the workload and motivation context. Discussing the observed results, the study partially confirms the hypothesis of aesthetics affecting the outcome when the task is difficult in the context of NFB. The relevance of the age variable is addressed, and potential effects in the context of executive functioning and technology adoption processes are considered. Results encourage further research on the topic of NFB design optimization, including verum NFB in the patient population to increase NFB therapy potential.",

    "title": "Multivariate environmental exposures are reflected in whole-brain functional connectivity and cognition in youth",
    "content": "Each individual's complex, multidimensional environment, known as their 'exposome', plays an essential role in shaping cognitive neurodevelopment. Understanding the mechanisms whereby children's exposome influences their development is crucial to facilitate the design of interventions to foster positive developmental trajectories for all youth. Recent work has identified a general exposome factor associated with socio-economic inequality that is strongly related to cognition and individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in youth. Building on these findings, the current study explores whether alterations in functional connectivity may represent a potential mechanism linking variation in the exposome to cognitive performance. We apply a data-driven, cross-validated, whole-brain machine learning approach, connectome-based statistical inference, to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with exposome scores among early adolescents enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using data collected during three cognitive tasks and during rest. Additionally, we investigate whether the identified patterns of functional connectivity relate to individual differences in cognitive performance across three domains: General Cognition, Executive Functioning, and Learning/Memory. Models incorporating 10-fold cross-validation over 100 iterations identified consistent functional connections associated with the exposome across task and rest conditions (model performance: ns = 6,137-8,391, rs = 0.34 - 0.44, ps <.001). Results were robust across data collection sites and functional connections common across all significant models were associated with cognitive performance across domains (ps < 0.0009). Collectively, these findings reveal that multidimensional environmental exposures are reflected in patterns of functional connectivity and relate to cognitive functioning among youth.",

    "title": "Inhibition of oxytocin neurons during key periods of development has long-term behavioural and body composition effects",
    "content": "Oxytocin (OT) is a neuromodulator of social behaviour in mammals and accumulative data support the concept of a critical period for OT action during infancy. However, it is possible that the specific functions of OT depend on different time periods of action. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.",

    "title": "Expansion of Working Memory Capacity Supports Early Skill Learning",
    "content": "Real-world motor skills depend on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of action sequences refined through practice. Working memory, which transiently maintains and manipulates task-relevant information, supports skill acquisition expanding with extensive training, as shown in expert domains such as in master chess players. Yet, the temporal dynamics of working memory emergence and expansion during the rapid performance gains that define early skill learning remain unclear. We addressed this question across three experiments in which participants learned various naturalistic sequential keypress skills. Within each practice trial, we observed segments of high-initial-skill (HIS)--transient periods of elevated performance followed by skill drops--that persisted throughout training. The keypress content of HIS segments scaled with execution speed and systematically increased with practice, reflecting an expansion of keypress chunk content consistent with the progressive enlargement of working memory capacity. Importantly, HIS segment keypress content continued to rise even after overall performance plateaued. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling ({theta}/{gamma} PAC) and beta ({beta})-band bursts, mechanisms implicated in maintaining and binding individual actions into sequences in working memory, were elevated during HIS segments with hippocampal {theta}/{gamma} PAC predicting HIS segment content. Our results suggest that working memory capacity expands during early learning of a naturalistic skill and continues strengthening with practice after skill plateau is reached, possibly supported by hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling.",

    "title": "Processing of Emotional Faces Has Unique Functional and Cytoarchitectural Associations in those with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
    "content": "Those with an autism spectrum diagnosis (ASD) have been found to process emotional faces differently than other populations. Processing of emotional faces requires engagement of temporal, frontal, occipital, and limbic brain regions. Functional activity has been shown to differ in those with an ASD, particularly in the amygdala, inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and temporal brain regions. However, the consistency and direction of these associations have been inconsistent across studies. Recent findings have demonstrated that measures of neuron density differ in those with an ASD. Some of these regional differences in cytoarchitecture coincide with regions important to emotional facial processing. Therefore, the interaction between cytoarchitecture and functional activity may be important in elucidating unique neurophysiology in ASD. The present study uses diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between cytoarchitecture and functional activity during emotional face processing in those with an ASD. 75 individuals with a reported ASD and 6,396 individuals with no reported diagnosis of an ASD (nASD) were identified. The emotional n-back (EN-Back) task was administered during fMRI acquisition, activating regions of the brain associated with processing emotional faces. Neuron cell body density was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala in the ASD group but not the nASD group. These findings suggest that a unique relationship may exist between neuron cell body density in the left amygdala and functional activity while processing emotional faces in those with an ASD.",

    "title": "A Common Neural Signal of Evidence Accumulation for Perceptual and Mnemonic Decisions",
    "content": "Humans frequently make decisions based on sensory input from the external environment or information retrieved from memory. The centro-parietal positivity (CPP), an event-related EEG potential, has recently been identified as a neural correlate of sensory evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this component also reflects evidence accumulation during decisions based on long-term memory. The present study investigated whether the CPP serves as a domain-general signal of evidence accumulation across both perception and semantic memory-based decisions. We designed a visual discrimination task in which participants discriminated between the luminance of two alphanumeric strings across three levels of difficulty defined by the luminance difference. In a semantic memory task, participants discriminated between the populations of two different U.S. states, binned into three difficulty levels using US census data. After each decision, participants rated their confidence on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). We observed a CPP component in both tasks, the slope of which scaled with the sensory or mnemonic evidence in both stimulus- and response-locked analyses. Furthermore, these CPP slopes were sensitive to reaction times (RT) and confidence in both tasks. Finally, the peak height of the CPP just prior to the response, indicative of one's decision boundary, was strongly correlated across tasks, suggesting that a common threshold was applied to the abstract evidence quantity being accumulated. Our results indicate that the CPP can be used to track the unfolding dynamics underlying decisions made both on the basis of external sensory evidence and internal mnemonic evidence.",

    "title": "Disrupted Top-Down Modulation as a Mechanism of Impaired Multisensory Processing in Children with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
    "content": "Atypical sensory processing is a core feature of autism, particularly when integration across sensory modalities is required. The neural mechanisms underlying these multisensory differences remain unclear. We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8 to 13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.",

    "content": "ObjectivesBy employing deep learning-based automatic whole-brain region segmentation technology, we aim to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional brain volumes and disease duration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).MethodsA retrospective study design was implemented on 83 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had complete clinical and imaging data. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRI) were imported into the uAI platform for automated regional segmentation of brain tissue. Volumetric data from five major brain regions and 80 subregions were extracted to explore their potential associations with disease progression in PD patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression model within the framework of linear regression analysis, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.ResultsCross-sectional analysis revealed that in PD patients, volume ratios of multiple brain regions\u2014including the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobules, bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, and right globus pallidus\u2014were negatively associated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, the right hippocampus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus showed positive correlations (p < 0.05). The combined volume ratios of these brain regions also decreased with longer disease duration (p < 0.05). Furthermore, absolute volume differences in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and cerebellar white matter increased as the disease progressed (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn PD patients, volume ratios and absolute volume differences in specific brain subregions associated with lateralized intracranial changes may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing brain tissue alterations during disease progression.",

    "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

    "title": "Cross-modal neuroplasticity in partial hearing loss: a mini-review",
    "content": "Sensory loss induces adaptive neural changes in the remaining non-deprived senses, known as cross-modal plasticity. Recent proposals of cross-modal plasticity suggest that it is a top-down, dynamic phenomenon that can occur through the lifespan and is initiated whether sensory loss is total (as in blindness or deafness) or more subtle (mild-to-moderate partial sensory loss). However, it is unclear whether adaptive plasticity differs between total and partial loss, because there is less research on the latter condition. Here we reviewed neuroimaging research on cross-modal plasticity in adult humans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and compared it to three claims derived from deafness research. First, cross-modal plasticity is thought to involve both intra-modal strengthening of remaining senses and cross-modal recruitment of deprived cortical areas, but we were unable to identify strong evidence of cross-modal recruitment in adults with partial hearing loss. Second, cross-modal plasticity is believed to arise through top-down connections and implicates cognitive function, which agreed with our findings. Third, cross-modal plasticity is believed to enhance perception in the non-deprived senses. No study in our review supported this claim, but it is possible that cross-modal plasticity in partial hearing loss results in stronger modulation of auditory function by intact senses. In addition, many study outcomes in humans with partial loss were inconsistent. Overall, it may be premature to conclude that cross-modal plasticity operates the same for partial and total forms of sensory loss in humans, and we provide several recommendations for testing these claims in future research.",

    "content": "Medical imaging has become an essential tool for identifying and treating neurological conditions. Traditional deep learning (DL) models have made tremendous advances in neuroimaging analysis; however, they face difficulties when modeling complicated spatiotemporal brain data. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are inspired by real neurons, provide a promising option for efficiently processing spatiotemporal data. This review discusses current improvements in using SNNs for multimodal neuroimaging analysis. Quantitative and thematic analyses were conducted on 21 selected publications to assess trends, research topics, and geographical contributions. Results show that SNNs outperform traditional DL approaches in classification, feature extraction, and prediction tasks, especially when combining multiple modalities. Despite their potential, challenges of multimodal data fusion, computational demands, and limited large-scale datasets persist. We discussed the growth of SNNs in analysis, prediction, and diagnosis of neurological data, along with the emphasis on future direction and improvements for more efficient and clinically applicable models.",

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.10467v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.",

    "title": "Navigating the Ethics of Internet Measurement: Researchers' Perspectives from a Case Study in the EU",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.10408v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.",

    "title": "Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.10032v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for \"legitimate\" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting \"response instability\"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing \"model instability\"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.",

    "title": "Grating haptic perception through touchscreen: Sighted vs. Visually Impaired",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.10026v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\\% vs. 84.5\\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09867v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the ability to generate synthetic gaze data. However, most approaches have primarily focused on generating data from random noise distributions or global, predefined latent embeddings, whereas individualized gaze sequence generation has been less explored. To address this gap, we revisit two recent approaches based on diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and introduce modifications that make both models explicitly subject-aware while improving accuracy and effectiveness. For the diffusion-based approach, we utilize compact user embeddings that emphasize per-subject traits. Moreover, for the GAN-based approach, we propose a subject-specific synthesis module that conditioned the generator to retain better idiosyncratic gaze information. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of these modified approaches utilizing standard eye-tracking signal quality metrics, including spatial accuracy and precision. This work helps define synthetic signal quality, realism, and subject specificity, thereby contributing to the potential development of gaze-based applications.",

Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.",

Beyond exposure, the work context (e.g., workload, team structure, and support) may shape mental health outcomes. We examined a cross sectional international CM sample (N = 166) and a U.S. prospective CM sample, including a comparison group of data labelers or tech support workers (N = 45) and gold standard diagnostic interviews. Predictors included workplace factors (e.g., hours per day distressing content, culture), cognitive-affective individual differences, and coping. Across samples, probable diagnoses based on validated clinical cutoffs were elevated (PTSD: 25.9 to 26.3%; depression: 42.1 to 48.5%; somatic symptoms: 68.7 to 89.5%; alcohol misuse: 10.5% to 18.3%). In the U.S. sample, CMs had higher interviewer rated PTSD severity (d = 1.50), likelihood of a current mood disorder (RR = 8.22), and lifetime major depressive disorder (RR = 2.15) compared to data labelers/tech-support workers. Negative automatic thoughts (b = .39 to .74), ongoing stress (b = .27 to .55), and avoidant coping (b = .30 to .34) consistently predicted higher PTSD and depression severity across samples and at 3 month followup. Poorer perceived workplace culture was associated with higher depression (b = -.16 to -.32). These findings strongly implicate organizational context and related individual response styles, not exposure dose alone in shaping risk. We highlight structural and technological interventions such as limits on daily exposure, supportive team culture, interface features to reduce intrusive memories, and training of cognitive restructuring and adaptive coping to support mental health. We also connect implications to adjacent human in the loop data work (e.g., AI red teaming), where similar risks are emerging.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09667v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs. To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.",

While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey \\textit{what} to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and \\textit{how} to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used \\textit{multimodal instruction} to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09612v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) has improved human decision-making across various domains by leveraging the complementary capabilities of humans and AI. Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.04802v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recordings of increasingly large neural populations have revealed that the firing of individual neurons is highly coordinated. When viewed in the space of all possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures called neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or during sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond to continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons. Classical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors can be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety of attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking network connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated. Here, we address this question by using group representation theory to formalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and the resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring model, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold. Interpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel with feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we then generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group representation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant RNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group Fourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a low-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the symmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results underline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a given symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different symmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle points.",

Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10261v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.",

These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.",

    "content": "Background: Stroke induces profound neuroinflammation and systemic immune dysregulation, including disturbances in gut homeostasis. Experimental evidence suggests that intestinal barrier permeability (IBP) and bacterial translocation (BT) critically influence stroke outcomes. However, biological variability among commonly used rodent sub-strains has received limited attention. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared post-stroke immune responses in two Wistar rat sub-strains obtained from different suppliers: RccHan (Envigo) and RjHan (Janvier). Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, animals were assessed 72 hours later and stratified according to the presence or absence of BT. Immune cell populations in blood and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry, and leukocyte infiltration into ischemic brain tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Results: Both sub-strains developed significant infarcts and neurological deficits. RccHan rats displayed larger infarct volumes and more extensive BT across multiple organs. In contrast, RjHan rats exhibited BT mainly confined to mesenteric lymph nodes but showed greater IBP. Although dissemination was broader in RccHan rats, overall bacterial burden was slightly lower compared with RjHan, and extra-intestinal bacterial composition differed between groups. Notably, RjHan rats presented stronger systemic and central immune activation, with marked alterations in lymphocyte and monocyte populations and enhanced granulocyte and T cell infiltration within ischemic lesions. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that sub-strain origin profoundly influences post-stroke intestinal barrier integrity, bacterial dissemination, and immune responses. Considering sub-strain-related variability is essential to improve reproducibility and translational relevance in preclinical stroke research.",

    "title": "Observing being touched enhances the neural processing and perception of digital gentle stroking",
    "content": "Observing touch activates similar brain regions as experiencing an actual touch, suggesting that visual information can cross-modally influence tactile perception. This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated how observing being touched affects the processing and perception of digitally delivered tactile stimuli resembling affective stroking or non-affective tapping. Thirty-three participants received touch patterns on their left forearm via a wearable sleeve while viewing spatiotemporally aligned videos of touch or a photo of an arm. Continuity and pleasantness ratings were higher for stroking than tapping. Correlations between continuity and pleasantness ratings for stroking or tapping conditions were stronger when presented with touch videos than with photos. Analysis of evoked brain activity revealed cross-modal effects after 0.6 seconds at centro-parietal and frontal electrodes for stroking, which differed from the effects observed for tapping. Visual modulation of pleasantness ratings correlated positively with processing differences between stroking and tapping in two right frontal clusters in later time windows around 1.36 and 1.8 s. These results suggest that visual inputs influence tactile pleasantness through somatosensory and multisensory processing, as well as frontal valuation of pleasantness. Our study extends previous research on affective touch by demonstrating informative visual cross-modal influences on digitally actuated touch at behavioural and neural levels.",

    "title": "A dynamic causal inference framework for perception-action loops",
    "content": "Causal inference, the process of inferring the causes of our sensory input, is central to multisensory perception. While most computational models of causal inference focus on static perceptual tasks with no temporal or motor components, real-world behavior unfolds dynamically and often involves closed-loop control. Here, we introduce and validate a general modeling framework that unifies multisensory causal inference with optimal feedback control by casting the problem as inference and action in a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). Our framework combines approximate inference over latent causal structures with a mixture-of-controllers approach, in which each controller is optimized for a specific causal model and weighted by the current belief in that model. We show that classical static models of multisensory perception are special cases of our framework, and extend them to dynamic, action-oriented settings where inference and control evolve over time. Using simulations of previously published behavioral tasks, including visuo-vestibular heading discrimination and path integration with interception, we show that the model reproduces key empirical findings, such as S-shaped biases in heading estimation and motor strategies based on inferred object motion. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach in novel task extensions, including motion in depth, latent switching dynamics, and multi-objective motor control. Together, our results provide a principled, general-purpose computational account of how causal inference and motor behavior interact in dynamic, uncertain environments, offering a bridge between theories of perception and action.",

    "title": "Interpretable and Brain-Inspired Recurrent Model of Hierarchical Decision-Making Capturing Trial-by-Trial Variability",
    "content": "Humans often make decisions in hierarchical environments, where low-level perceptual judgments inform high-level strategies. Understanding how the brain computationally navigates such multi-level decisions remains an open challenge. While existing models offer statistical insights, they often fall short in capturing the neural mechanisms and trial-by-trial variability underlying individual choices. To address this gap, we developed a neurocomputational model that integrates a biologically inspired attractor network for low-level perceptual decisions with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-level strategic adjustments. With minimal architectural constraints, the RNN receives only raw firing rates, feedback, and prior environment, learning to infer environment-switching strategies without explicit access to confidence or stimulus strength. In a hierarchical task combining motion discrimination and bandit decisions (N = 9; ~10,800 trials), the model successfully reproduced three hallmark behavioral patterns observed in humans. Unlike previous models, the model also captured trial-to-trial variability in switching decisions and implicitly learned to estimate decision confidence. For interpretability, we used representational and sensitivity analyses. Representational analyses revealed internal dynamics consistent with evidence accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while sensitivity analysis identified feedback as the dominant influence on strategy, modulated by recent trial history. This framework combines interpretability and predictive power, moving beyond simple data fitting to provide mechanistic insights into how the brain integrates confidence and feedback to guide adaptive behavior in hierarchical decision-making.",

    "content": "Decoding human emotion states from neural activity has significant applications in human-computer interfaces, psychiatric diagnostics, and neuromodulation therapies. Intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) provides a promising modality for decoding by balancing temporal, spatial, and noise resolutions. However, real-world application of decoding requires high performance that integrates neural activity from both grey and white matter, stable generalization across different contexts, sufficient neural encoding explainability, and robust real-time implementation, all of which remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously recorded iEEG and abundant self-rated valence and arousal scores--measuring the two primitive dimension of emotion--across two emotion-eliciting tasks in eighteen epilepsy subjects. We developed self-supervised deep learning models that achieved high-performance decoding by integrating grey and white matter signals, generalizing across tasks. The models provided strong explainability by revealing shared and preferred mesolimbic-thalamo-cortical subnetworks encoding valence and arousal, as well as the structural connectivity basis underlying grey and white matter integration. Finally, the models were implemented online and realized robust real-time decoding in four new subjects. Our results have implications for advancing emotion decoding neurotechnology and understanding emotion encoding mechanisms.",

    "content": "Inferring biological states from animal behavior is a crucial but challenging step in biomedical discovery that is constrained by variability and labour-intensive assays, even with AI-powered tools. Here, we show that simple images of static paws, analyzed by our custom keypoint segmentation AI-tool provide accurate read-outs for a wide array of physiological states. Without invasive testing, our method detects postural changes associated with nerve injury, acute pain, aging, and the genetic loss of kpna4, a regulator of paw innervation. Leveraging the toe-spread-reflex, a spinal-circuit driven response, the approach requires no habituation and shows low behavioral variability. Individual digits emerge as biomarkers for internal states with digit V indicating neuropathic pain during nerve damage and digit I reflecting loss of kpna4. Our model is freely available and can readily be adapted to other tasks or species. These findings establish unstimulated paw posture as a scaleable, low-cost, readout for biological states.",

    "content": "Voltage gated potassium channels are major determinants of excitability of Purkinje cell (PC) neurons in the cerebellum. We have previously shown that in the cerebellum, activation of mGluR1 with agonist DHPG leads to reduced surface expression of Kv1.2 and that Kv1.2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII which are known interactors of mGluR1. However, mGluR1 can also signal independently of agonist through a constitutively active, protein kinase A-dependent pathway. Here we show that in HEK293 cells, co-expression of mGluR1 increases the surface expression levels of Kv1.2. This effect occurs in absence of mGluR1 agonists and in the presence of an mGluR1 inhibitor. Co-expression of known downstream effectors of the agonist driven mGluR1 pathway, including PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII, had no effect on Kv1.2 surface expression or on the ability of mGluR1 agonist to modulate that expression. In contrast, the inverse agonist BAY 36-7620 significantly reduced the mGluR1 effect on Kv1.2 surface expression, as did pharmacological inhibition of PKA with KT5720.",

    "title": "Increased striatal coupling one week after ischemic stroke revealed by ultrafast functional MRI",
    "content": "Background: Network reorganization following ischemic stroke is thought to play a role in recovery. Although cortico-cortical reorganization is widely established, changes in interhemispheric striatal connections following ischemia remain poorly understood, even when stroke occurs in motor areas. Given the importance of the striatum to motor function, we investigated network-level striatal coupling in stroke using ultrafast resting-state fMRI, which has recently been shown to facilitate the dissection of synchronous oscillatory activity better than its conventional ~1 sec time-resolution counterparts. Methods: A cohort of (N=18) sedated rats were randomized and N=9 rats underwent unilateral photothrombotic ischemic lesioning in motor cortex. One week after the lesion, when plasticity and recovery are well established, all animals were scanned on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a cryogenic coil using an ultrafast resting-state functional MRI sequence with temporal resolution of 90 ms. Data were collected for 24 minutes, and spectral power, phase locking, and functional connectivity were quantified. Histology was performed to confirm lesion extent. Results: While cortico-cortical power, connectivity and synchrony were diminished one week post-stroke as expected, we surprisingly found increased striato-striatal power, synchrony and functional connectivity in the stroked group compared with the control group. In stroked animals, the spectral power in the ultraslow oscillation frequency band (0.02-0.4 Hz) significantly increased in the striatum while decreasing in the cortex. When data were undersampled to \"conventional\" fMRI temporal resolution (900 ms), the striatal effects were lost, revealing the power of ultrafast fMRI approaches in unveiling such phenomena. Conclusions: Increased striato-striatal coupling, in the form of increased synchrony, spectral power, and functional connectivity, was revealed by ultrafast resting-state fMRI, but not conventional temporal resolution resting-state fMRI. Our findings suggest more involvement of subcortical areas in network reorganization than previously thought.",

    "title": "Head stabilization behavior and underlying circuit mechanisms in larval zebrafish",
    "content": "Head stabilization is essential for animal survival, enabling stable sensory input and effective motor coordination. Animals stabilize their heads in response to vestibular stimuli through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). While the VCR has been characterized in tetrapod vertebrates, it remains unknown whether fish, which lack an anatomical neck, employ a comparable behavior. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit VCR-like behaviors: they adjust their head orientation relative to the body by rostral body flexion during pitch tilts. The rostral body flexed ventrally during head-up posture, whereas it flexed dorsally during head-down posture. These flexions partially compensated for the head pitch changes, thereby contributing to head stabilization. We also identified the muscles and neural circuits responsible for these two types of body flexions. Both the dorsal and ventral flexions were mediated by the same vestibular nucleus, but neural signals were transmitted through distinct pathways, either involving or bypassing a class of reticulospinal neurons. The dorsal and ventral flexions were ultimately produced by specialized dorsal and ventral muscles in the rostral body, respectively. The neural circuits underlying these body flexions in fish share similarities with those underlying the mammalian VCR. Together, our results demonstrate that fish exhibit a VCR-like behavior through comparable circuit mechanisms, suggesting that the VCR is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates.",

    "content": "Aging encompasses low-level inflammation and motor decline. Astrocytes are neuroregulatory glial cells that change in aging, particularly in the cerebellum, which is essential for movement coordination. Regulation and functionality of cerebellar astrocytes in aging is unknown. We show that antiviral type I Interferons (IFN-I) drive motor deficits and regional astrocyte aging. Transcriptomics reveal that cerebellar astrocytes, but not cortical, exhibit an antiviral state that intensifies with age, with increased expression of Stat1. Aged mice display motor deficits similar to humans that improve after peripheral IFN-I receptor neutralization, whereas astrocyte Stat1 induces motor deficits during chronic inflammation in adults. While strong systemic inflammation induces astrocyte antiviral state, in aging, chromatin de-repression of Stat1 and nucleotide sensors in cerebellar astrocytes amplifies local IFN-I signaling. We identify functional interaction between a classical immune pathway and astrocytes, representing an actionable strategy to preserve motor function in aging.",

Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development data, we benchmarked ethnic/racial bias in models predicting cognitive functioning from 81 MRI phenotypes across four training strategies. Models trained on one ethnicity performed best within that group. Models trained on participants sampled without regard to ethnicity, a common practice, performed better on White participants, likely because the ABCD sample was predominantly White. Training on equal-sized White and African American subsamples reduced disparities without accuracy loss. Structural MRI exhibited the greatest bias, whereas task-based fMRI phenotypes were more equitable. Stronger brain-cognition associations generalized more equitably, but multimodal stacking despite enhancing prediction, did not improve fairness. Increasing representation of African American participants improved performance up to balanced sampling, with diminishing returns beyond. This first modality-wide benchmark reveals pervasive, modality dependent ethnic bias in cognitive prediction and identifies key factors shaping equity in neuroimaging models.",

    "title": "Electrophysiological Brain Connectivity and Subjective States Evoked by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Mediodorsal Thalamus",
    "content": "Recent advances in human intracranial EEG (iEEG) have enabled new investigations into the role of the thalamus in human brain functions. In this study, we applied direct intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) to the mediodorsal (MD) subregion of the thalamus using both high-frequency (50 Hz, iESHF) and low-frequency (0.5 Hz, iESLF) procedures to examine its impact on conscious experience and causal brain connectivity in 30 patients with focal refractory epilepsy (128 electrode contacts). iESHF of the MD elicited reportable changes in conscious experience in 11 of 12 patients (39 sites; 83 stimulations across 27 unique pairs) - predominantly in the visceral, emotional, or somatosensory domains and often described as unpleasant without any lateralization effect. Our connectivity analyses based on iESLF revealed that the cingulate and insular cortices produced stronger electrophysiological responses in the MD (inflow connectivity) than did the sites in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) within the same individuals. Moreover, MD stimulation showed its strongest outflow connectivity to the cingulate, insular, and PFC regions, all significantly stronger than to medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Notably, inflow from both MTL and insula sites to the MD were significantly stronger than their reverse directions, indicating clear asymmetry in connectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that stimulation of the human thalamus can modulate conscious experience. They also highlight the extensive bidirectional connectivity between the MD and cingulate and insular cortices along with asymmetric connectivity between the MD and MTL and insula sites in the human brain.",

    "content": "Nociceptors, primary afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious stimuli, are broadly divided into slowly conducting unmyelinated C fibers and fast-conducting myelinated A fibers. Whereas C-nociceptors have been extensively studied, considerably less is known about the function of A-nociceptors. To address this gap, we developed an intersectional genetic approach for robust and selective interrogation and manipulation of mechanically responsive A-nociceptors (A-MNs) in mice. Optogenetic A-MN stimulation induced rapid and precise withdrawal reflexes as well as place aversion and facial expression changes consistent with pain affect, while inhibition strongly impaired mechanical nociceptive withdrawal reflexes, demonstrating that A-MNs are necessary and sufficien t for rapid avoidance of noxious mechanical stimuli. Prolonged A-MN activation induced mechanical allodynia and central sensitization. In a rare individual lacking thickly myelinated A{beta} fibers, mechanical withdrawal reflexes were completely absent, and pain perception reduced. Together, these findings identify fast-conducting mechano-nociceptors as essential drivers of nocifensive behaviors in mice and humans.",

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "Hyperthermic Seizure Susceptibility and Focal Decreases in Parvalbumin-Expressing Cortical Interneurons in a Mouse Model of PCDH19-Clustering Epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective: Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19)-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is a severe genetic epilepsy that manifests with early-onset cluster seizures often triggered by fever, intellectual disability, autistic features, and later neuropsychiatric risk. PCDH19 is an X-linked gene critical for brain development. PCE predominantly affects females and rare mosaic males, but not hemizygous males, likely due to cellular mosaicism arising from random X-inactivation and resultant segregation of wild-type and mutant neurons (so-called cellular interference) during development. We generated a novel PCE mouse model and explored neuronal segregation, seizure susceptibility and cortical interneuron distributions. Methods: Female Pcdh19+/- mice were crossed with X-GFP males to visualize random X-inactivation patterns. Seizure susceptibility was assessed in juvenile mice using hyperthermia and flurothyl exposure. Behavioral testing evaluated cognitive domains. Interneuron distribution in hippocampus and cortex was examined histologically by immunolabeling and crosses with parvalbumin reporter mice. Results: Juvenile Pcdh19+/- females lacked spontaneous seizures but displayed lower seizure thresholds and more severe seizures during hyperthermia. Seizure susceptibility did not differ from controls after flurothyl exposure. Pcdh19+/- females also exhibited segregation of GFP+ cells in the cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and medial ganglionic eminence, with a marked reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal region. Although parvalbumin interneuron density was unchanged in the Pcdh19+/- female cortex overall, localized decreases arose in GFP- (Pcdh19 knockout) cortical stripes. Interpretation: Juvenile PCE mice exhibit seizure susceptibility to hyperthermia and disrupted the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings suggest focal parvalbumin interneuron alterations may contribute to PCE pathophysiology.",

    "title": "DTI-ALPS PRIMARILY REFLECTS WHITE MATTER DIFFUSION DISPERSION AND MICROSTRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY IN NEURODEGENERATION: INSIGHTS FROM MULTI-MODAL MRI",
    "content": "1.1 Background The glymphatic system facilitates clearance of metabolic waste and pathological proteins from the brain, and its dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a non-invasive MRI marker of glymphatic flow, although its biological specificity remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the determinants of DTI-ALPS and evaluate whether it primarily reflects white matter (WM) microstructure rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration. 1.2 Methods We examined 100 individuals referred to the Memory Clinic of the Policlinico Hospital in Milan for suspected dementia. All participants underwent a 3T-MRI protocol including 3D-T1-weighted and 3D-FLAIR imaging, double-shell diffusion-weighted imaging (b=1000/2000 s/mm2), and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences for quantitative susceptibility mapping. Within standard DTI-ALPS ROIs, we extracted DTI-ALPS values together with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MA) at both b-values, as well as neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, particularly the orientation dispersion index (ODI). WM microstructure was further characterized using the T1/FLAIR ratio and diamagnetic component of susceptibility (DCS). 1.3 Results and conclusions DTI-ALPS correlated inversely with MA (r = -0.84 at b = 1000; r = -0.86 at b = 2000) and positively with ODI (r = 0.73). Moderate correlations with the T1/FLAIR ratio and DCS supported sensitivity to WM alterations. Factor analysis indicated that DTI-ALPS clustered with MA and ODI rather than forming a distinct factor, suggesting that DTI-ALPS primarily reflects WM diffusion dispersion and heterogeneity rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Stress resilience is associated with transcriptional remodeling in the VTA",
    "content": "Individual responses to chronic stress vary, with some individuals remaining resilient while others exhibit susceptibility. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region involved in reward learning, and the lateral habenula (LHb), a region involved in aversive learning, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders. Here, we seek to understand the molecular adaptations in these regions at the level of single cells that mediate susceptibility versus resilience. In particular, it remains unclear whether, at the level of gene expression, different cell types within different brain regions mediate stress susceptibility versus resilience, or if these phenotypes are mediated by distinct trajectories within the same cell types. To address this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of LHb and VTA of mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. While we found minimal gene expression changes in the LHb after stress, the VTA exhibited widespread, cell type-specific transcriptional remodeling in resilient individuals and few gene expression changes in susceptible individuals. Across VTA cell types, resilience was associated with the coordinated upregulation of genes involved in intercellular signaling and neural communication, with maintenance of receptor-ligand interaction strength in resilience that was not present in susceptibility. Within VTA neurons, gene expression changes were most prominent in glutamatergic and dopaminergic clusters. Multivariate analyses of dopamine and glutamate subclusters showed that resilient neurons diverged more from control than susceptible neurons, but along a similar trajectory, supporting a model in which resilience reflects greater stress-related adaptations in these cell types. Together, these findings highlight the VTA as a key site of molecular plasticity in stress resilience and therefore a potential therapeutic target.",

    "title": "Characterizing neuronal population geometry with AI equation discovery",
    "content": "The visual cortex contains millions of neurons, whose combined activity forms a population code representing visual stimuli. There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single neuron and population levels: direct measurements suggest that the population code is high-dimensional, but current understanding of single-cell tuning curves implies low dimensionality. To reconcile this discrepancy, we used AI to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for tuning curves to oriented stimuli. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs, and evolved using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their fits to single-cell tuning. This resulted in an equation that not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code's high-dimensional structure, even though population dimensionality was not the AI system's objective. This high-dimensionality occurred because the AI-derived tuning curves were not smooth at their peaks, which we proved is mathematically required for high-dimensional population coding of low-dimensional stimuli. We used the AI-generated tuning equation to demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional codes in a simulated hyperacuity task, and showed that non-smooth peaks are also present in other brain systems, leading to high-dimensional population coding in head direction cells. These results suggest that the smoothness of neuronal tuning curves has an important role in setting the dimensionality of the population code, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can accelerate scientific theory building in neuroscience and beyond.",

    "title": "Inhibitory inputs to avian ITD circuits",
    "content": "In birds, detection of sound source azimuth begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL), which computes interaural time differences (ITDs). Inhibition has been proposed to protect NL neurons from losing ITD sensitivity with increasing sound level, although the nature of this inhibition is incompletely understood. Anatomical studies show GABAergic synapses throughout NL and the first order nuclei, while in vitro studies in chicken NL showed that depolarizing, GABAergic IPSPs shorten membrane time constants, perhaps to allow the membrane potential to follow rapid synaptic currents accurately over a range of sound levels. Given the importance of inhibition in regulating auditory brainstem activity, we examined the nature of the inhibitory input to NL in vivo. The Superior Olivary Nucleus (SON) is the major source of descending GABAergic inhibition to the ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus angularis (NA) and NL, and receives excitatory input from NA and NL. We used viral tracers to reveal projections from SON to NL, and characterized response types within SON. In NL, we isolated inhibitory synaptic currents from extracellular field potentials through the iontophoretic application of blockers of GABA (gabazine) or glycine (strychnine). These blockers increase the onset and offset responses evoked by tonal stimuli, but did not shift best ITD. The co-application of gabazine and strychnine revealed supra-linear summation of GABA and glycine. Profiles of synaptic activation revealed more prominent inhibition following stimulus offset, suggesting inputs to NL originate from both the sustained and offset response types of the SON. These heterogeneous responses may represent separate SON neuronal populations.",

    "content": "Neuronal assemblies--groups of co-active neurons--support memory consolidation and retrieval. In the hippocampus, assemblies can pre-exist learning and contribute to memory through sequential activation. Whether similar principles apply to higher cortical areas for flexible memory storage like the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) remains unclear. Using a novel ground truth-validated clustering approach, we investigated the activity of longitudinally tracked mouse OFC neurons during cue-reward memory acquisition and maintenance. Assemblies active after learning pre-existed the learning and exhibited two distinct sequential dynamics suggestive of memory consolidation or retrieval. Consolidation sequences emerged during learning, while retrieval sequences partly recruited pre-existing reward sequences. These findings demonstrate that OFC learning recruits pre-existing networks flexibly repurposed for new associations, revealing circuit motifs that may enable cortical memory storage.",

    "title": "Efficient and reproducible pipelines for spike sorting large-scale electrophysiology data",
    "content": "The scale of in vivo electrophysiology has expanded in recent years, with simultaneous recordings across thousands of electrodes now becoming routine. These advances have enabled a wide range of discoveries, but they also impose substantial computational demands. Spike sorting, the procedure that extracts spikes from extracellular voltage measurements, remains a major bottleneck: a dataset collected in a few hours can take days to spike sort on a single machine, and the field lacks rigorous validation of the many spike sorting algorithms and preprocessing steps that are in use. Advancing the speed and accuracy of spike sorting is essential to fully realize the potential of large-scale electrophysiology. Here, we present an end-to-end spike sorting pipeline that leverages parallelization to scale to large datasets. The same workflow can run reproducibly on individual workstations, high-performance computing clusters, or cloud environments, with computing resources tailored to each processing step to reduce costs and execution times. In addition, we introduce a benchmarking pipeline, also optimized for parallel processing, that enables systematic comparison of multiple sorting pipelines. Using this framework, we show that Kilosort4, a widely used spike sorting algorithm, outperforms Kilosort2.5 (Pachitariu et al. 2024). We also show that 7x lossy compression, which substantially reduces the cost of data storage, has minimal impact on spike sorting performance. Together, these pipelines address the urgent need for scalable and transparent spike sorting of electrophysiology data, reparing the field for the coming flood of multi-thousand-channel experiments.",

    "title": "Endosomal MrGPRX1 signaling sensitizes TRPV1 to enhance itch",
    "content": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid) channels are crucial for signal transduction in physiological processes, including neurotransmission, pain, and itch. Downstream effectors of GPCR signaling can directly stimulate TRPV channels or enhance their sensitivity to stimuli, a process known as TRPV sensitization. Traditionally, GPCRs are activated at the cell surface by extracellular agonists, triggering signaling cascades. Recent evidence suggests GPCRs continue to signal from intracellular organelles. The human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor X1 (MrGPRX1) is a GPCR expressed in primary sensory neurons involved in nociception and pruritus. Recent studies demonstrated how intracellular GPCR signaling regulates neuronal activity. However, there is no evidence characterizing MrGPRX1 trafficking or intracellular signaling. Herein, we characterized MrGPRX1 signaling within the endosomal network and its role in sensitizing TRPV1 channels to enhance itch signaling. Utilizing subcellular targeted biosensors, we demonstrated MrGPRX1 can traffic and signal from endosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MrGPRX1 internalizes following BAM8-22 stimulation. BRET assays revealed that MrGPRX1 activation induces Gq and {beta}-arrestin-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin blocked BAM8-22-induced MrGPRX1 endocytosis and decreased nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Calcium signaling confirmed that MrGPRX1-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is mediated by protein kinase C and ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel role for MrGPRX1 endosomal signaling in TRPV1 sensitization. Understanding the mechanisms of MrGPRX1 signaling offers valuable insights into differentiating between pain and itch pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain and persistent itch.",

    "title": "Slow waves generation and propagation in a model of brain lesions",
    "content": "Slow waves (SWs), the hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, reflect the periodic occurrence of transient silent periods in cortical neurons (Down states). During NREM, SWs and Down states physiologically disrupt large-scale network interactions. Since early EEG studies, SWs have also been observed in awake patients after brain injury. Emerging evidence indicates that these intrusions of sleep-like activity interfere with ongoing network activity and contribute to motor and cognitive deficits; yet, the mechanisms governing the generation and spread of post-lesional SWs remain unclear. Here, we extend a neural mass model of EEG to capture transitions between wake-like and sleep-like dynamics and embed it in connectome-based networks with virtual lesions. This model supports that local disfacilitation, topology-dependent propagation, and synchrony-dependent amplification throughout the connectome are sufficient to produce post-lesional SWs. These mechanisms reproduce the spatial gradients of post-lesional SWs seen in patients and identify actionable targets for neuromodulation and rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Characterization of mechanical tissue properties in post-mortem human brain using magnetic resonance elastography",
    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health condition that can cause neurological dysfunction to varying degrees depending on the nature of the mechanical insult. In biomechanical studies of TBI under high loading conditions, post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) are often used since ethical concerns prohibit such experiments in living human subjects. Because PMHS brains undergo significant changes following death, it is important to understand the relationship between the mechanical properties of PMHS brain tissue and living tissue. In this study, we performed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) on three PMHS specimens to estimate the material properties of the cadaveric brain, namely the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as well as the resulting shear stiffness and damping ratio. We also performed longitudinal MRE scans on one of the PMHS over the span of two months to investigate the evolution of tissue properties with post-mortem degradation. In comparison to in vivo subjects of age range 70-75 years, a substantially higher stiffness (mean: 5.96kPa) and lower damping ratio (mean: 0.09) were found in PMHS models. This study also revealed an initial increase in shear stiffness up to the seventh day post-mortem, followed by a steady decrease by the fifty-eighth day. However, the damping ratio displayed an opposite trend to that of shear stiffness. These changes were heterogeneous across brain regions. The collected measurements and analysis elucidate the changes in mechanical properties in post-mortem subjects, and can be used to build and validate computational models of TBI.",

    "content": "Humans can experience a rich array of conscious experience, including highly stable, positive, and refined states of non-ordinary perception that can be elicited through advanced meditation. Here, we present the first group-level, ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI study of jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We combined local (regional homogeneity), mesoscale (connectivity gradients), and global (geometric eigenmodes) human brain mapping with diverse and detailed phenomenology, meditative traits, behaviorally assessed cognitive functions, and extensive publicly available psychobehavioral affinity maps. Across eight successive states of ACAM-J, we observed reproducible neural trajectories marked by anterior-to-posterior reorganization, flattening of cortical hierarchies, nonlinear reconfiguration of global harmonics, and tight coupling between brain metrics and equanimity, attentional stability, and behavior. Neurosynth decoding further associate ACAM-J with reduced suffering-related processes and more with attentional monitoring. These findings suggest ACAM-J is a distinct, structured mode of awareness that persists despite radically reduced narrative thought and sensory content. Our findings also inform boundary conditions for current models of consciousness. More broadly, this research indicates that advanced meditation is a powerful framework for understanding psychological transformation, and for potential new opportunities for supporting human well-being and flourishing.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN - I\u2019m Peter, here with Harry (devhawk), and we\u2019re building DBOS Java, an open-source Java library for durable workflows, backed by Postgres.<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-java</a><p>Essentially, DBOS helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive failures, restarts, and crashes without losing state or duplicating work. As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.<p>In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.<p>This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there's no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it's just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it's built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you're familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.<p>If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:<p><a href=\"https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart?language=java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart?language=java</a><p>We'd love to hear what you think!

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "content": "Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications. Our hybrid gesture dataset and source codes are available on Github.",

    "content": "Opioid misuse remains rampant as new synthetic opioids reach the market. Large-scale genetic tools like the GWAS identify previously unrecognized targets and biomarkers in opioid misuse with hopes of combating the opioid epidemic. One such target is the AMPAR auxiliary protein Cornichon Homolog-3 (human analog: CNIH3, mouse analog: Cnih3), which determines AMPAR subunit composition and kinetics. Though CNIH3 was identified as a gene of interest in OUD, its role in opioid use and accompanying risk factors has not been studied. Using mice with Cnih3 deletion, we assess the role of CNIH3 in risk factors for opioid use, cognition, and opioid use itself. We find that Cnih3 deletion moderately impairs spatial memory, reward-cue association, and reversal learning. Cnih3 deletion also impairs fentanyl-cue association and blunts fentanyl intake during IVSA. We use principal component analysis to pinpoint the dimensions in which Cnih3 deletion impacts behavior in an unbiased manner. Additionally, we identify in previously published human data that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are more protective against progression to daily opioid use in women than in men, suggesting a potential sex-specific role of CNIH3. These findings highlight an important role of CNIH3 in opioid use through learning and memory processes that may differ between males and females.",

It can be impaired due to a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as external factors such as time pressure or stress. To assist users during decision-making, we propose a decision-making brain computer interface (BCI) that can alert to uninformed decision-making, prompt additional information seeking and therefore improve decision-making quality. To this aim, we establish the feasibility of decoding uninformed decision-making from local field potentials recorded with implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes in 6 participants. We show that decoding of available information above chance level is possible for all participants, both after stimulus presentation, as well as before task response. Starting from stimulus onset, the temporal processing hierarchy of informed vs. uninformed decision-making spans from visual processing through hippocampal memory processes to frontal control network shifting. The anterior insula, known to be a decision-making hub, codes available information during the decision phase prior to button press. These results further elucidate the neural basis of coded information availability and confirm the feasibility of a decision-making BCI.",

    "title": "Multiparametric MRI and imaging transcriptomics reveal molecular and cellular correlates of neurodegeneration in experimental multiple system atrophy",
    "content": "Background: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive -synucleinopathy characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction associated with widespread oligodendroglial -synuclein inclusions, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed characteristic patterns of brain atrophy and microstructural alterations in MSA, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these imaging abnormalities remain poorly understood. The proteolipid protein-human -synuclein (PLP-Syn) transgenic mouse model reproduces key pathological and behavioral features of MSA and provides a valuable platform to dissect the biological substrates of MRI-detected changes and their relevance to disease mechanisms. Methods: We performed the first whole-brain MRI characterization of the PLP-Syn model using ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with imaging alterations, we applied an imaging transcriptomics framework integrating MRI-derived phenotypes with more than 4,000 spatial gene expression maps from the Allen Brain Atlas. Gene ontology and cell-type enrichment analyses identified biological processes and cellular contributors linked to MRI changes, and imaging-correlated genes were compared with differentially expressed genes from cerebellar RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to assess molecular concordance. Results: PLP-Syn mice exhibited widespread brain atrophy involving the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and white matter tracts, closely mirroring neuroimaging findings in patients with MSA. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in major white matter tracts and increased mean diffusivity in the brainstem and cerebellum, reflecting distinct microstructural pathologies. Imaging transcriptomics linked these alterations to genes regulating myelination, gliogenesis, and neuroinflammation, strongly enriched for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte markers, while diffusivity changes were associated with neuronal connectivity and energy metabolism. Imaging-correlated gene signatures showed significant overlap with RNAseq-derived molecular profiles, reinforcing the biological validity of the imaging-derived mechanisms. Conclusions: MRI sensitively detects MSA-like neurodegeneration in the PLP-Syn mouse, providing a translationally relevant platform to investigate the biological basis of imaging biomarkers. Integrating MRI with spatial transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MRI-detected alterations, advancing mechanistic understanding of MRI changes in MSA and establishing imaging transcriptomics as a powerful approach to bridge neuroimaging with molecular pathology in -synucleinopathies.",

    "title": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of a de novo C9ORF72 knock-in isogenic iPSC cell bank to model ALS and FTD",
    "content": "Background: The pathogenic G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Studies focused on delineating the underlying perturbed mechanisms resulting from this genetic mutation are often confounded by the heterogeneity present in current disease models, such as patient-derived iPSC lines, with estimations of between 5-46% of the variation in iPSC cell phenotypes resulting from inter-individual differences. Isogenic models, in which the pathogenic mutation is introduced into a defined genetic background, offer a powerful approach to isolating mutation-specific effects and enable high-resolution comparison across distinct ALS/FTD-associated mutations. Such models are essential for uncovering convergent disease mechanisms and improving reproducibility in ALS/FTD research. Methods: A two-step scarless CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy was used to generate isogenic human iPSC lines carrying a de novo knock-in of a disease-length G4C2 repeat expansion in theC9ORF72 locus. The resulting lines underwent thorough quality control and were differentiated into lower motor neurons and assessed for the presence of key ALS/FTD pathologies, including changes to C9ORF72 mRNA and protein expression, RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins. Results: Two C9ORF72 knock-in iPSC lines were generated with 631 and 600 G4C2 repeats, alongside an isogenic genome editing control line. The C9ORF72 G4C2repeat expansion knock-in iPSC lines exhibit both loss-of-function and gain-of-function pathological features characteristic of ALS/FTD. Compared to the parental wild-type KOLF2.1J line and isogenic (wild-type) CRISPR control line, these exhibit a significant reduction in C9ORF72 mRNA and protein levels, the presence of RNA foci accumulation, and a marked increase in poly(GA) and poly(GP) dipeptide repeat protein levels in iPSCs and motor neurons. Conclusions: This is one of the first reports of a successful knock-in of the pathogenic C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansion into a human iPSC line, establishing a genetically defined and physiologically relevant model of ALS/FTD. These isogenic lines recapitulate both key loss- and gain-of-function disease pathologies, providing a crucial complement to existing patient-derived iPSC banks. By eliminating confounding genetic background variability, these cell lines will enable more precise interrogation of C9ORF72-linked pathomechanisms and offer a robust platform for comparative studies across the ALS and FTD spectrum, mechanistic investigations, and future therapeutic targeting with enhanced translational relevance.",

    "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play important roles not only in immune response but also in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural circuit formation. Microglia also surveil the brain environment via elongation and retraction of their processes. Previously, we found that the purine salvage pathway is involved in the regulation of morphology and dynamics of the microglial cell line BV2. Here, we show that intraperitoneal administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, reduces microglial branching during postnatal development. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MMF administration decreases guanosine nucleotides in the brain. Interestingly, despite the essential role of guanosine nucleotides in cellular proliferation, MMF administration did not significantly affect microglial proliferation. On the other hand, MMF administration attenuated the level of GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Rac1 small GTPases. Notably, MMF administration decreased the number of branches, while process length remained unaffected. Since microglial branching affects microglial complexity and diversity, our findings suggest that guanosine nucleotide production is essential for generating proper microglial diversity.",

    "content": "Temporal cues help us focus attention at just the right moment. Whereas visual temporal attention selectively boosts perception at attended times at a cost to other moments, it remains unclear whether auditory temporal attention operates under the same constraints. To address this question, we designed a two-target temporal cueing task where participants discriminated the frequency sweep direction of one of two successive auditory stimuli, separated by 250 ms, while temporal attention was directed to one or both time points. We found that temporal attention improved auditory discrimination only for the first time point and could then remain sustained across the interval, without evidence of attentional tradeoffs across time. Further, manipulating auditory feature uncertainty changed overall performance but did not modulate the impact of temporal attention or yield tradeoffs. Finally, comparison to previous data from a closely matched visual task confirmed that while temporal attention enhanced perception in both vision and audition, only vision shows tradeoffs at this timescale. Altogether the results suggest that the temporal constraints on attention are modality-dependent.",

    "content": "Proprioceptive feedback from muscles is essential for continuous monitoring and precise control of limb movement, yet how such peripheral feedback is integrated into ongoing descending motor cortical dynamics remains largely unclear. Here we used precisely timed optogenetic stimulation of forelimb muscles to manipulate proprioceptive signals during a mouse reach-to-consume task. Mice were able to successfully reach and consume despite muscle stimulation-evoked forelimb deviations. Across the cortex, the caudal forelimb area (CFA) was preferentially activated by muscle-specific proprioceptive inputs and contributed to stabilizing perturbed forelimb movement. CFA extratelencephalic (ET) neurons encoded movement kinematics as well as proprioceptive feedback. At neuron population level, proprioceptive perturbations rapidly deflected CFA ET neural trajectories away from the task-relevant manifold yet exerted only limited effects on evolving task dynamics. These results reveal that descending cortical circuit implements activity subspace separation to encode and integrate distorted proprioceptive feedback while preserving task-relevant output.",

    "title": "Investigating the Effects of APOE Genotype on Intracellular Cholesterol and the Endolysosomal System in the Aging Mouse Brain",
    "content": "Individuals who possess the {epsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) are at a significantly increased risk for developing Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the precise reason for this association is not fully understood. Beyond its effects on amyloid and tau, APOE also influences fundamental cellular processes in the brain, including cholesterol trafficking between cells and within the endolysosomal system, which may be a critical component of the APOE4-associated vulnerability to AD. Here, we examined how APOE genotype, sex, and aging alter intracellular cholesterol processing and the endolysosomal system in the mouse brain. Using the novel cholesterol-binding probe D4H*-mCherry, we quantified intracellular cholesterol levels, the levels of early endosomes (Rab5), late endosomes (CD63), and lysosomes (LAMP1), and the colocalization of cholesterol with these endolysosomal compartments. This analysis was performed in the cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex of young, middle-aged, and old APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 mice. Our analysis revealed region-specific changes in intracellular cholesterol and the endolysosomal system in response to aging, sex, and APOE genotype. Notably, young APOE4 mice showed reduced cholesterol within early and late endosomes, but increased lysosomal abundance, suggesting impaired cholesterol processing. These APOE4-specific effects were less apparent in older animals. These effects were strongly modified by sex, with female APOE4 mice exhibiting elevated lysosomal cholesterol in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at old age, indicating sex-dependent susceptibility. Together, these results reveal that APOE genotype, age, and sex interact to influence endolysosomal cholesterol homeostasis, with female APOE4 mice showing the greatest dysregulation. These findings suggest that early and region-specific endolysosomal defects may contribute to the heightened AD risk associated with APOE4, particularly in females.",

    "title": "Sequence preparation is not always associated with a reaction time cost",
    "content": "The extent to which a sequence of movements is prepared before initiating the first movement is a longstanding question in motor neuroscience. The observation that reaction time (RT) increases for longer sequences has been used as evidence of sequence preparation; reflecting the additional demands of preparing multiple movements before initiating a sequential action. However, many processes contribute to RT, making it unclear whether the observed RT increases specifically reflect sequence preparation. For example, with longer sequences, participants face greater ambiguity in selecting their first movement in the sequence. Here, we test how much of the observed RT increases can be explained by the first-target ambiguity when reaching toward spatial targets. In our paradigm, we independently manipulate: (i) the number of future targets displayed, (ii) the number of targets to be acquired, and (iii) the spatial arrangement of the targets. This approach allows us to vary the demands of sequence preparation and first-target ambiguity, thereby enabling a direct assessment of their respective influence on RT. We report that RT increases with additional sequence elements but that this effect is fully explained by the ambiguity in selecting the first reach target. That is, sequence preparation causes no RT increase. In fact, when first-target ambiguity is eliminated, RT is constant across the number of displayed targets even though kinematic analysis reveals that participants have prepared a sequence. Together, these results indicate that preparing multiple reaches to spatial targets does not impose additional temporal costs relative to preparing a single reach.",

Currently, this process is time-consuming and heavily dependent on the operator s expertise. Objective: This study evaluated a deep learning based approach to structural brain connectivity for improving stimulation site prediction and real time cortical excitability mapping during neuronavigation. Results: Tractography derived connectivity features and distal myographic responses were used to train four neural network models across five subjects. Neural network inputs were incrementally varied using either tractography alone, coil coordinates alone, or hybrid combinations of both using different concatenation regimes. The best performance was observed in two subjects out of 5, where hybrid models integrating coil coordinates and fiber information achieved higher F1 scores and accuracy. Conclusion: Despite these promising results, substantial inter-subject variability was observed. This approach may also be applied to other brain regions to investigate connectivity, and the use of machine learning could be extended to functional domains beyond the motor cortex, including sensory and cognitive areas.",

    "title": "Behavioral Thermoceptive Responses and Morphologic Correlates in Mouse Models of CMT1A, HNPP and Aging",
    "content": "Background: Thermoceptive dysfunction is a frequent but understudied feature of peripheral neuropathies and aging. Patients often report abnormal heat perception, yet the underlying sensory mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated thermoceptive behavior and corresponding structural changes in mouse models of inherited dysmyelinating neuropathy and natural aging to identify shared and divergent mechanisms. Methods: Thermal preference was assessed using a user-independent gradient apparatus spanning physiological to noxious temperatures, with automated quantification of time in zone, distance traveled, and velocity. Nocifensive responses were evaluated by hot plate latency. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was measured in paw pads, and TRPV1-positive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Results: Thermal gradient testing revealed preserved temperature preference in CMT1A and HNPP mice but significantly altered behavior in aged animals, which spent less time in warmer zones. Hot plate testing showed prolonged times to nocifensive behavior in aged and CMT1A mice, whereas HNPP mice exhibited variable responses. IENFD was markedly reduced in aged mice but preserved in CMT1A and HNPP. DRG analysis revealed smaller soma diameters and reduced proportions of TRPV1-positive A{delta} neurons in aged mice, while CMT1A animals maintained normal morphology. Interpretation: Aging produces thermoceptive deficits through axonal degeneration and selective A{delta}-fiber vulnerability, whereas CMT1A mice display conduction-related impairment due to dysmyelination. Both models reproduce key human sensory phenotypes and provide translational platforms for studying small-fiber dysfunction and therapeutic interventions in peripheral neuropathies.",

Both approaches revealed the expected pattern of lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AxD) in AD, consistent with white matter degeneration. Despite broadly similar global trends, substantial bundle-level differences emerged between the two tractography methods. Probabilistic tracking produced stronger and more spatially extended effects in the fornix, a small and highly curved limbic pathway vulnerable to AD-related degeneration, whereas deterministic tracking showed greater sensitivity in the posterior segments of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF\\_R). These discrepancies highlight that the choice oftractography algorithm can alter detecting disease effects, emphasizing the need for cross-method validation to ensure the robustness and interpretability of along-tract measures.",

    "title": "Evaluating Sample-Size Efficiency and Sensitivity of Tractometry in Alzheimer's Disease",
    "content": "Tractometry allows quantitative analysis of white matter microstructure along the brain's fiber tracts, but the impact of study design parameters- such as sample size and along-tract resolution- on sensitivity and specificity is not well understood. In this study, we conducted tractometry bootstrap analysis using linear-mixed models across four diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to systematically evaluate how these factors affect the detection of dementia- and amyloid-related effects. While coarser along-tract segments yield greater sensitivity and higher mean effect sizes, finer segments tend to produce higher peak effect sizes, revealing more spatially localized effects. Dementia-related effects were more widespread and detectable with fewer subjects, whereas amyloid-related effects were more subtle and localized, requiring larger cohorts to detect them. These findings highlight that tractometry offers improved spatial specificity and can reliably detect small, fine-scale effects, but study design should be tailored to specific research questions, considering the expected spatial extent and magnitude of effects, to optimize sample size efficiency and interpretability.",

    "title": "Extracting task-relevant preserved dynamics from contrastive aligned neural recordings",
    "content": "Recent work indicates that low-dimensional dynamics of neural and behavioral data are often preserved across days and subjects. However, extracting these preserved dynamics remains challenging: high-dimensional neural population activity and the recorded neuron populations vary across recording sessions. While existing modeling tools can improve alignment between neural and behavioral data, they often operate on a per-subject basis or discretize behavior into categories, disrupting its natural continuity and failing to capture the underlying dynamics. We introduce Contrastive Aligned Neural DYnamics (CANDY), an end-to-end framework that aligns neural and behavioral data using rank-based contrastive learning, adapted for continuous behavioral variables, to project neural activity from different sessions onto a shared low-dimensional embedding space. CANDY fits a shared linear dynamical system to the aligned embeddings, enabling an interpretable model of the conserved temporal structure in the latent space. We validate CANDY on synthetic and real-world datasets spanning multiple species, behaviors, and recording modalities. Our results show that CANDY is able to learn aligned latent embeddings and preserved dynamics across neural recording sessions and subjects, and it achieves improved cross-session behavior decoding performance. We further show that the latent linear dynamical system generalizes to new sessions and subjects, achieving comparable or even superior behavior decoding performance to models trained from scratch. These advances enable robust cross-session behavioral decoding and offer a path towards identifying shared neural dynamics that underlie behavior across individuals and recording conditions. The code and two-photon imaging data of striatal neural activity that we acquired here are available at https://github.com/schnitzer-lab/CANDY-public.git.",

    "title": "Spinal electrophysiology reveals frequency-specific spatial patterns of neural activity and corticospinal coherence during pincer-grip",
    "content": "Background: Neural dynamics within sensory-motor networks involved in motor control exhibit well-established frequency-dependent patterns of cortical activity. In contrast, corresponding neural patterns of spinal cord activity remain poorly understood. As an active functional part of motor control, characterising spinal cord activity is essential for understanding sensorimotor function. High-density electrospinography presents a novel technique to assess spinal neural dynamics by non-invasively recording task-relevant electrical activity. Objective: To non-invasively investigate spatio-spectral patterns of task-related spinal activity and its functional connectivity with cortical regions during isometric pincer-grip contraction. Methodology: Here, we simultaneously recorded 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG), 64-channel electrospinography (ESG), and two bipolar electromyography (EMG) signals during an isometric pincer-grip task. We investigated frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity and cortico-spinal connectivity by calculating task-related ESG power and cortico-spinal coherence between ESG and EEG signals during the isometric hold phase. Results: Distinct frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity were observed at lower cervical levels during sustained hold, with significant activation over the ipsilateral anterolateral region. In the beta band, task-related spinal activity was significantly ipsilateralised, and exhibited significant cortico-spinal connectivity between contralateral motor cortex and ipsi-anterolateral spinal region. Conclusions: This first-of-its-kind application of HD non-invasive spinal electrophysiology revealed that the spinal cord exhibits distinct frequency-specific spatial activation and cortical connectivity patterns during pincer-grip sustained hold. Specifically, the ipsi-anterolateral spinal region demonstrated high task-relevance, potentially indicating anterior horn activity and its connectivity with motor cortex. Furthermore, beta-band activation was observed as a key signature during sustained hold, further underpinning its relevance during motor control.",

    "title": "Sleep arousals are associated with the polygenic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and with cognitive decline in healthy late middle-aged individuals",
    "content": "Objective: Sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as early features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. In that context, spontaneous arousals during sleep have been associated with the burden of Amyloid beta in the brain of healthy late middle-aged individuals. Whether the heterogeneity of arousals during sleep may be related to the genetic risk of developing AD in young adults is not established. Likewise, whether arousals may be associated with cognitive decline is not known. Here, we evaluated the association between arousals, the genetic risk for developing AD and cognitive performance and cognitive decline in healthy young and late-middle-aged individuals. Methods: We classified spontaneous arousals using in-lab EEG recordings of sleep in 453 younger individuals (22+/-2.7y; 49 women) and 87 late middle-aged individuals (59.3+/-5.3y; 59 women) based on their association with sleep stage transitions and changes in muscle tone. We examined the associations between arousal types and the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD, cognitive performance at baseline and, in late middle-aged individuals, cognitive decline over 2 and 7 years. Results: The prevalence of arousals associated with sleep stage transition was higher in late middle-aged vs. younger individuals. Among these arousals, those with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, associated with lower and higher PRS for AD in late middle-aged but not in younger individuals. In the late middle-aged individuals, transition arousals associated with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, correlated with better and worse attentional performance at baseline, and lower and larger memory decline over 2 or 7 years. Conclusion: The heterogeneity in spontaneous arousals during sleep may reflect their physiological intensity or underlying neural activation, and may indicate vulnerability to AD in late middle-aged individuals. The findings may contribute to identifying early markers of neurodegenerative risk.",

    "title": "A Challenge To The Assumption That Short- versus Long-Access Groups of Opioid Users Represent Distinct Phenotypes",
    "content": "Rationale: One of the current models for drug (opioid) user typology employs differential access conditions to categorize takers into short-access and long-access groups (ShA, LgA) with the rationale that these groups represent distinct opioid user phenotypes. However, with the idea that differential vulnerabilities to opioid effects are already present prior to experimenter assignment into these groups, it is unclear that these groups represent distinct opioid user types. To clarify this, we have developed a method that includes principal component analysis-gaussian mixtures model clustering of variables derived from a new CENTERED (Cumulative Experience-Normalized Time-Effect on Response as an Exponential Decay structure) model. The goal of this study was to utilize CENTERED clustering to test the hypothesis that ShA and LgA groups defined by the experimenter via random assignment are composed of mixtures of individuals that belong to distinct opioid user types. Methods: We reanalyzed data from a previous study in which the experimenter assigned male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30) self-administering 0.1 mg/kg/infusion oxycodone for 20 days into ShA (3h-access) and LgA (9h-access). We conducted CENTERED clustering on all takers, irrespective of assigned group(s) to determine if the experimenter-assigned groups included mixtures of individuals from groups (opioid user types) identified via CENTERED clustering. Results: CENTERED clustering revealed that ShA and LgA groups consisted of mixtures of different opioid user types. Conclusions: CENTERED clustering revealed that experimenter-imposed grouping via differential access conditions limits our ability to identify distinct opioid user types that already exist naturally in the population.",

    "title": "Launch HN: Tweeks (YC W25) \u2013 Browser extension to de-enshittify the web",
    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Jason & Matt and we\u2019re building Tweeks (<a href=\"https://tweeks.io\">https://tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter/highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you\u2019ve used Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next\u2011generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand\u2011writing custom JS/CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn\u2019t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there's a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website/app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else's site (not our own), and we don't want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A/B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an \u201caverage\u201d user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I\u2019ve also been hacking \u201cpage fixers\u201d as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters/highlights (first with F12/inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you\u2019ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. \u201chide cookie banners and add a price/quality score\u201d), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled/disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one\u2011shot examples from early users:<p><i>Hacker News</i>: Filter posts by title/url or points/comments, modify header and text size.

It\u2019s currently free, but each use costs tokens so we'll likely need to cap usage to prevent abuse. We're more interested in early feedback than your money, so if you manage to hit the cap, message us at contact@trynextbyte.com or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2</a>, tell us how you're using it/what features you want next, and we'll happily reset it for you.<p>Btw if you do anything interesting with it, feel free to make a shareable link (go to \u2018Library\u2019 and press \u2018share\u2019 after generating) and include it in the comments below. It\u2019s fun to see the different things people are coming up with!<p>We're rapidly shipping improvements and would love your feedback and comments.

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
    "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

    "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

    "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

    "title": "On the Causal Role of the Right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Active Forgetting",
    "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

In this work, we show a numerical analysis of this on the occasion of the latest large connectomes, the mouse visual cortex and the fruit-fly optical lobe, which, while evolutionarily distant share similar motion processing strategies. In general, it is found that the local node strengths can follow heavy-tailed distributions that decay faster than a power-law (PL), if we shuffle the weights among the nodes randomly. To understand this deviation from the global PL behavior, we propose a mechanism that can explain this difference which may resolve the ubiquitous contradicting observation of lognormal (LN) and PL tails related to critical behavior. We also show that synaptic weights of edges of fully proofread connectomes considered here, emanating from source and terminating at the sink nodes (broadcasters/integrators), respectively, exhibit PL tailed distributions, with exponents smaller than 3, so they are scale-free.",

    "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

    "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
    "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",

    "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
    "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

    "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

    "title": "An Autophagy-Inducing Compound Reduces Tau Pathology, Microglia Reactivity, and Rescues Working Memory in 3xTg AD Mice",
    "content": "Background Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have validated the use of amyloid beta (A{beta})-clearing antibodies, which reduce A{beta} pathology but leave other disease hallmarks largely unaddressed. Since AD involves multiple pathological processes, additional strategies are needed to target complementary mechanisms. One such target is autophagy, a lysosomal mediated degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis that removes toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. This process is implicated in AD, as impaired lysosomal function promotes A{beta} and tau accumulation. Our laboratory recently identified a novel natural mitophagy-inducing compound (MIC) that may serve as a therapeutic intervention for AD. Methods We evaluated the effects of MIC in aged 3xTgAD mice, a transgenic model displaying both A{beta} and tau pathology. Mice received either standard diet or diet containing MIC beginning at age 4 months until 20 months on alternating weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic (NonTg) controls were included under standard and MIC-supplemented diets to assess compound effects during normal aging. Neuropathological changes were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, phosphorylated tau (pTau), and microglial reactivity. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess spatial learning and memory and the Y-maze to measure working memory. Results At 20 months of age, our neuropathological assessment showed that 3xTgAD mice fed an MIC-supplemented diet had a significant reduction in pTau accumulation and microglial reactivity, although A{beta} burden remained unchanged. At 15 months, MIC diet also improved spatial learning and memory in aged NonTg controls but not in 3xTgAD mice. However, in younger 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice, MIC restored working memory performance to NonTg levels, indicating an age-dependent therapeutic response. Conclusion MIC emerges as a potential modulator of tau pathology and neuroinflammation. As a naturally derived compound, MIC offers potential for combination therapy with FDA-approved A{beta}-clearing antibodies, enabling a multimodal approach to AD treatment that addresses amyloid, tau, and microglia-related pathology.",

    "title": "Acetylcholine reflects uncertainty during hidden state inference",
    "content": "To act adaptively, animals must infer features of the environment that cannot be observed directly, such as which option is currently rewarding, or which context they are in. These internal estimates, known as hidden states, guide behaviour but are inherently uncertain. Theoretical models propose that efficient inference requires tracking both the most likely state and the uncertainty of that estimate. While neural representations of state identity have been described in cortical and hippocampal circuits, the origin of uncertainty signals remains unclear. Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) reflects this uncertainty during hidden state inference. Using fibre photometry in mice performing a probabilistic two-armed bandit task, we found that ACh release in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus tracked recent omission history and predicted whether animals would switch choice on the next trial. Blocking muscarinic receptors with scopolamine selectively impaired loss-driven switching without affecting stable performance. A hidden-state inference model in which ACh modulated how uncertainty from past experience shaped future beliefs reproduced both the physiological and behavioural effects, whereas alternative models did not. These results identify ACh as a neuromodulatory signal reflecting uncertainty during hidden-state inference, linking theoretical models of belief updating to their biological implementation in the mammalian brain.",

    "content": "FGF13, a noncanonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and member of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor (FHF) subset, lacks a signal sequence and was previously reported to remain intracellular, where it regulates voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at least in part through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of VGSCs. Recent reports suggest that FGF13 is secreted and regulates neuronal VGSCs through interactions with extracellular domains of integral plasma membrane proteins, yet supportive data are limited. Using rigorous positive and negative controls, we show that transfected FGF13 is not secreted from cultured cells in a heterologous expression system nor is endogenous FGF13 secreted from cultured neurons. Further, employing multiple unbiased screens including proximity protein proteomics, our results suggest FGF13 remains within membranes and is unavailable to interact directly with extracellular protein domains.",

    "title": "Early impairment in dentate pattern separation in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
    "content": "The dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation utilizes sparse neural coding to support memory formation. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the dentate undergoes extensive restructuring, including loss of local inhibition. It is unknown how circuit changes impact dentate network computations in awake behaving animals. Here we perform high-density tetrode recordings from the dentate in male rats treated with systemic kainic acid (KA) to induce TLE. In KA-treated rats, dentate spatial representations were less precise at the single neuron level, however the stability of the spatial code in representing repeated visits to the same location was retained at the population level. Despite spared spatial representation, the network computations for pattern separation were disrupted. The reorganized dentate network in KA-treated rats generated less distinct population activity patterns for different environments, specifically as a result of impaired rate-remapping. Changes in network computations paralleled impairments in a dentate-dependent memory task, potentially providing a link between altered pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These deficits were present in animals with confirmed dentate circuit reorganization that had not yet developed spontaneous seizures - suggesting that the dentate network changes underlying altered rate-remapping and impaired dentate-dependent memory occur early in epileptogenesis.",

    "content": "The phase of alpha oscillations is proposed to reflect perceptual cycles. Yet, human EEG/MEG studies have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because they used correlative approaches that did not consider causal phase-perception relationships. In a multi-day computational EEG study, we developed the neurobehavioral link function (NBLF) as a new approach to model individual sinusoidal relationships between the alpha phase and multisensory perception and to test for causality. Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis. A follow-up psychophysical experiment confirmed individual phase-dependent effects at 5 and 10 Hz, but not 15 Hz. Our results suggest that the individual alpha phase causally modulates perceptual cycles in multisensory integration and advocate for personalized, phase-targeting strategies in neurotechnologies.",

Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

    "title": "Dopamine-mediated improvements of the step threshold task in Parkinson\u2019s disease: validation against clinical measures of motor and cognitive function",
    "content": "IntroductionStandardized treadmill-based balance disturbances have potential to improve assessments of dynamic balance control in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

    "title": "The effects of aquatic and land-based interventions on children with developmental coordination disorder",
    "content": "BackgroundKnowledge about the effects of aquatic intervention on children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), as well as the maintenance of these effects over time, is still scarce. We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "content": "Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a critical prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet effective therapeutic interventions to prevent or delay this conversion remain an unmet clinical need. Growing evidence implicates dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA)-a complex bidirectional communication network involving neural, immune, and endocrine pathways-in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. This perspective proposes that acupuncture, as a multi-target therapeutic approach, may modulate gut microbiota composition and restore MGBA homeostasis, thereby potentially decelerating the progression from aMCI to AD. A systematic understanding of the precise mechanisms through which acupuncture influences the MGBA carries substantial implications for both neuroscience and clinical practice. Future investigations should prioritize the elucidation of these mechanisms and the generation of robust clinical evidence through well-controlled experimental designs.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe management of Alzheimer\u2019s disease has shifted toward disease-modifying therapies aimed at delaying disease progression rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. This study summarizes the latest evidence regarding the benefits and harms of anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease drugs.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science databases, and other sources up to April 2025. Two researchers independently reviewed the literature and analyzed the data. A network meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3 and Stata version 18.0 to calculate mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for direct and indirect comparisons. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA). Bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2.0, and publication bias was analyzed with funnel plots.ResultsThe network meta-analysis included 23 randomized controlled trials with 16,010 participants, evaluating nine pharmacological interventions ranging from traditional symptomatic therapies to four United States Food and Drug Administration- and National Medical Products Administration-approved disease-modifying therapies, notably anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies. Aducanumab significantly improved ADAS-cog scores compared with placebo (MD -5.97, 95%CI -10.33, \u22121.61; SUCRA: 93.0%) and demonstrated notable improvements in ADCS-ADL scores (MD 4.99, 95%CI 2.27, 7.72; SUCRA: 98.6%). Memantine ranked highest for neuropsychiatric symptoms (SUCRA: 80.8%). Aducanumab also had the highest SUCRA for CDR-SB (91.5%) and showed moderate superiority in MMSE scores (MD 3.55, 95%CI 1.35, 5.75; SUCRA: 98.2%).ConclusionSymptomatic treatments, especially memantine for neuropsychiatric symptoms, remain effective. However, the network meta-analysis indicates that, for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease, aducanumab demonstrates the greatest potential for cognitive and clinical improvement (MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL), despite associated risks such as adverse events and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities linked to disease-modifying therapies. Lecanemab provides moderate benefits, while donanemab appears less effective. Thus, clinicians should apply disease-modifying therapies cautiously and individually, carefully balancing potential risks and benefits for each patient.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO [CRD42025637730], https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09458v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.09454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.",

We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09337v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09309v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Measuring GUI task difficulty is crucial for user behavior analysis and agent capability evaluation. Yet, existing benchmarks typically quantify difficulty based on motor actions (e.g., step counts), overlooking the cognitive demands underlying task completion. In this work, we propose Cognitive Chain, a novel framework that models task difficulty from a cognitive perspective. A cognitive chain decomposes the cognitive processes preceding a motor action into a sequence of cognitive steps (e.g., finding, deciding, computing), each with a difficulty index grounded in information theories. We develop an LLM-based method to automatically extract cognitive chains from task execution traces. Validation with linear regression shows that our estimated cognitive difficulty correlates well with user completion time (step-level R-square=0.46 after annotation). Assessment of state-of-the-art GUI agents shows reduced success on cognitively demanding tasks, revealing capability gaps and Human-AI consistency patterns. We conclude by discussing potential applications in agent training, capability assessment, and human-agent delegation optimization.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09240v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The problem of Motion Sickness (MS) among passengers significantly impacts the comfort and efficiency of In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems (IVIS) use. In this study, we innovatively designed SimPath, a visual design to effectively mitigate passengers' MS and boost their efficiency of using IVIS during driving. The study focuses on the problem of irregular motion conditions frequently encountered during actual driving. To validate the efficacy of this approach, two sets of real - vehicle experiments were carried out in real driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces passenger's MS level to a certain extent. However, due to divided attention from visual content, it does not directly improve the IVIS efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers crucial insights for the design of a more intelligent and user friendly IVIS, based on the discussion of the principle, providing strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the development of future IVIS in autonomous vehicles.",

    "title": "Plug-and-Play Clarifier: A Zero-Shot Multimodal Framework for Egocentric Intent Disambiguation",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.08971v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The performance of egocentric AI agents is fundamentally limited by multimodal intent ambiguity. This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.",

Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.08880v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, their potential to exacerbate or trigger severe psychological harms remains poorly understood and inadequately tested. This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm. This work contributes a novel methodology for identifying psychological risks, empirical evidence of common failure modes across systems, and a classification of harmful AI response patterns in high-stakes human-AI interactions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.08763v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Immersive rooms are increasingly popular augmented reality systems that support multi-agent interactions within a virtual world. However, despite extensive content creation and technological developments, insights about perceptually-driven social dynamics, such as the complex movement patterns during virtual world navigation, remain largely underexplored. Computational models of motion dynamics can help us understand the underlying mechanism of human interaction in immersive rooms and develop applications that better support spatially distributed interaction. In this work, we propose a new agent-based model of emergent human motion dynamics. The model represents human agents as simple spatial geometries in the room that relocate and reorient themselves based on the salient virtual spatial objects they approach. Agent motion is modeled as an interactive process combining external diffusion-driven influences from the environment with internal self-propelling interactions among agents. Further, we leverage simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the governing parameters of motion patterns can be estimated from simple observables. Our results indicate that the model successfully captures action-related agent properties but exposes local non-identifiability linked to environmental awareness. We argue that our simulation-based approach paves the way for creating adaptive, responsive immersive rooms -- spaces that adjust their interfaces and interactions based on human collective movement patterns and spatial attention.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.",

In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease. While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis. We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.",

Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.09243v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.",

Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al.

But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

    "content": "The open-source development model has been successfully applied to consumer and enterprise software, and recently to consumer hardware. Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

    "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
    "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "content": "The sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) enzyme is a key driver of axonal degeneration in response to injury, making it an attractive target for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and other nervous system diseases. In this study, we identified and optimised a new class of base-exchange inhibitors (BEXi) targeting SARM1 and explored their molecular interactions and conformational effects using cryo-EM, HDX-MS and SAXS. Although BEXi produced robust inhibition across all biochemical and cellular assay formats, application at sub-inhibitory concentrations consistently led to paradoxical SARM1 activation, and in neuronal assays, accelerated neurite degeneration. Further analysis showed that BEXi only delayed, rather than prevented, neurite degeneration when applied to primary neuronal cells, even at exceedingly high inhibitor concentrations. These results prompted us to discontinue BEXi development in favour of alternative strategies, underscoring the complexity of SARM1 as a therapeutic target and the need for comprehensive, mechanistically informed screening cascades.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "title": "Environmental factors contribute to cancer therapy toxicity",
    "content": "Cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects numerous cancer patients, however there is substantial variability in its severity. Here, we investigated how environmental factors such as housing facility and time of treatment, known as chronotherapy, impact chemotoxicity in a pediatric murine model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced CRCI. We find that MTX consistently impacts body mass in a time-of-day specific manner across different housing facilities. Intriguingly, investigation of the gut microbiome acutely after MTX chronotherapy revealed substantial differences in microbial composition between animals housed in different facilities as well as decreased microbial diversity at different times of day. Furthermore, these differences in the gut microbiome after MTX chronotherapy coincide with differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine profiles between facilities and times of day. Chronically, housing facility continued to impact serum cytokine levels after MTX treatment, whereas the effect of time wanes. Nonetheless, we found that time drastically alters chronic white matter microglial gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) after MTX treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate that both housing facility and time dictate response to MTX chronotherapy in the periphery and CNS. Collectively, this work elucidates putative factors that can regulate MTX-induced chemotoxicity.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide. Defining early pathobiological events remains challenging, in part due to inaccessibility of neural tissue. Because olfactory neurons are accessible, and olfactory loss is prevalent in AD, we evaluated olfactory brush biopsies from controls, individuals with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-confirmed AD, and cognitively typical individuals whose positive biomarkers signal a pre-clinical AD stage. We define via single cell RNA-sequencing (n=22 subjects) conserved neuroinflammatory T cell, myeloid, and olfactory neuron changes detectable even in pre-clinical AD subjects. Activated memory T cell states were a hallmark of pre-clinical AD, paralleling CSF T cell phenotypes seen in advanced disease, accompanied by both microglia-like inflammatory programs and olfactory neuron inflammatory injury. Together, our findings establish a novel platform permitting analysis of neural tissue in AD at its earliest stages.",

    "title": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis",
    "content": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is best known as a neuropeptide that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Independent from its activity in the HPT axis, TRH also exerts strong neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Although multiple factors have been linked to its neuroprotective action, the cellular mechanism of TRH neuroprotection is still not clear. Here we show that TRH protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated TRH transduction and TRH peptide given exogenously over 24 hours period of time inhibit glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This effect is not mediated by the decreased intracellular calcium response as TRH treatment (24 hours) has no effect on glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium nor the calpain activity. While TRH treatment (10 minutes) significantly inhibits glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium, no protective effect is observed when TRH is applied 30 minutes before or after glutamate stimulation. Instead, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibits the protective effect of TRH. LY294002 also blocks TRH induced AKT activation. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits the protective effect of TRH. Taken together, these results suggest PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and new protein synthesis are involved in the protective effect of TRH against glutamate toxicity, thereby providing mechanistic support for its action in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Multiple patterns of selectivity in superior colliculus control visual search",
    "content": "Visual search is a ubiquitous behavior for many animal species, but efficient search performance requires a relatively complex integration of target guidance and behavioral history signals. In this study, we investigate how the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain area implicated in the control of overt spatial attention, integrates these two control signals in a multi-target search task. Monkeys made sequences of saccades to stimuli presented in a grid while searching for a \"true\" (reward eliciting) target amid color-coded targets and distractors. The efficient performance of this task requires integrating a target guidance signal with a history of previously fixated locations in order to guide search to new potential targets that might offer reward. Theories of systems neuroscience suggest that this multi-factor search behavior might be controlled using either mixed selectivity, dynamic selectivity, or pure selectivity. We find evidence for SC neurons exhibiting each of these patterns and conclude that this brain structure participates in circuits representing target similarity and previously fixated locations, in addition to a circuit responsible for integrating these signals using the mechanisms of dynamic and mixed selectivity. We also introduce a novel time-series partial information decomposition analysis that provides a rich and direct view of how a neuron allocates its representational capacity. These findings support an emerging view of the superior colliculus as much more than a bottom-up priority map, but instead an important site for the flexible cognitive control of visually-guided behavior.",

    "title": "Scalable spike sorting across thousands of neurons by modeling neural dynamics with NeuroSort",
    "content": "Neural circuit research requires resolving the functional coding mechanisms at the single-neuron scale. However, neural signals captured from extracellular recordings are inherently complex, shaped both by electrode properties and the spatially distributed neural population activity across recording sites. These factors introduce strong signal mixing and waveform variation, making it diffcult for existing spike sorting methods to reliably isolate individual neurons from large-scale recodings. To address this, we develop NeuroSort, which fuses spatiotemporal information through a contrastive learning strategy to adaptively model neural dynamics. NeuroSort is a GPU-enabled, highly efficient spike sorting framework, enabling the isolating of up to thousands of neurons. We validated NeuroSort on in vivo extracellular recordings, including Utah array data from rhesus macaques performing motor tasks and Neuropixels 1.0 probe data from a rat during rest. Moreover, in a recording collected by the 1,024-channel Neuroscroll probe, NeuroSort sorted the largest number of well-isolated neurons from different brain areas while achieving a 2-8 times speedup over other methods.Taken together, NeuroSort generalizes across recording conditions, providing an interpretable and scalable paradigm for whole-brain dynamic analysis.",

    "title": "The School Cafeteria Problem: Disrupted Visuospatial Attention During Multisensory Speech-in-Noise Perception in Children with ADHD",
    "content": "BACKGROUND Many children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty distinguishing speech in crowded scenarios with competing conversations and noise. This can impact learning and community participation. Prior work has implicated audiovisual integration of lip movements with speech sounds as a potential underlying mechanism, but difficulty in accurately deploying spatial attention is an important, often overlooked, factor that may impact the accuracy of speech perception in noisy environments. OBJECTIVE Evaluate patterns of audiovisual integration and allocation of visuospatial attention during speech processing in a multiple-talker scenario among school-age children with ADHD and typically developing children (TD). METHODS We recruited 7-12-year-old children with ADHD to participate in an integrated virtual reality and electrophysiologic (EEG) speech-in-noise perception paradigm. In virtual reality, children were asked to press a button whenever a centrally-located target character spoke a target monosyllabic word, while ignoring any words spoken by two flanking distractor characters. We manipulated 1) audiovisual (AV) content by intermixing trials containing either audio, visual, or multisensory AV representations of the three characters and 2) spatial attention demands by including trials with and without interference from the distracting speakers. We measured AV gain in target detection accuracy. Simultaneously, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were continuously recorded via a 128-channel electrode array as an index of visuospatial attention allocation to each speaker. To elicit SSVEP, the target and distractor speakers were tagged with different visual frequency oscillations (23hz and 15hz, respectively). EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the corresponding first and second harmonics for those frequency bands was measured over the occipital scalp. RESULTS Children with ADHD showed reduced AV gain relative to TD controls. TD controls also demonstrated more robust SSVEP at 23Hz and 46Hz (target speaker) than at 15Hz (distractor speakers). Compared to TD children, children with ADHD had reduced selective activation in response to the target. As a result, children with ADHD showed more equivalent allocation of visuospatial attention between 23Hz target and 15Hz distractor frequencies. CONCLUSIONS Children with ADHD demonstrate a reduction in the typical perceptual benefit afforded by exposure to multisensory compared to unisensory speech stimuli, accompanied by substantial differences in the allocation of visuospatial attention to the relevant speaker. Thus, dysregulation of selective visuospatial attention may impair their ability to effectively perceive language in noisy settings.",

    "title": "Response dynamics in macaque ventral stream recapitulate the visual hierarchy",
    "content": "Chronic recording in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT) revealed a progression of feature selectivity over the duration of the response, with different images evoking strongest responses in different time bins. Neurons responded briskly and transiently to early best images and gave slower and more sustained responses to later best images. Correlations between IT selectivity and deep neural network (DNN) activations in early layers were faster and more transient than correlations with deeper DNN layers, suggesting a hierarchical representation unfolding. Analysis of best images in different time bins showed that early best images were simpler, or made up of fewer parts, than later best images. This simple-to-complex selectivity dynamic is consistent with, but more universal than, previously reported dynamics of global-to-local or category-to-exemplar selectivity. In parallel with the simple-to-complex selectivity progression, the image selectivity and the population activity became sparser during the response, consistent with the hypothesis of a canonical cortical microcircuit that pools inputs and incorporates neighboring-neuron inhibition. We propose that this temporal cascade in IT recapitulates the multiple antecedent stages in the visual hierarchy, which also show a simple-to-complex progression of feature selectivity.",

    "title": "Thalamofrontal synaptic weakening underlies short-term memory deficits from adolescent NMDAR hypofunction",
    "content": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is linked to schizophrenia, but prevailing models centered on reduced number and activity of inhibitory interneurons and the resulting excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance do not explain selective cognitive impairments. Here, we show that repeated adolescent NMDAR antagonism produces short-term memory (STM) deficits by weakening thalamofrontal (TF) synaptic transmission. In mice repeatedly exposed to ketamine, STM impairment coincided with reduced release probability and vesicle refilling at mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) synapses, without detectable changes in layer 2/3 to layer 2/3 synaptic release probability, intrinsic excitability, or synaptic ultrastructure. These presynaptic deficits were accompanied by diminished direction-selective population coding in the dmPFC as revealed by decoding analysis and impaired delayed alternation performance in the Y-maze. Chemogenetic strengthening of MD to dmPFC projections restored both neural selectivity and behavior. Our findings identify a circuit-specific presynaptic mechanism linking adolescent NMDAR hypofunction to cognitive dysfunction, challenging interneuron-centric models and establishing TF synapses as a potential therapeutic target in NMDAR-related disorders.",

    "title": "Self-compassion is linked to positive affect and buffers declines in self-esteem in low performers",
    "content": "Successes and failures shape affective experience and self-esteem. Self-compassion has been proposed as a protective factor, allowing individuals to acknowledge both strengths and shortcomings without excessive self-criticism. However, the mechanisms through which self-compassion influences changes in affect and self-esteem remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally tested whether self-compassion modulates the links between performance feedback, affective experience, and self-esteem. Participants completed an effortful performance task and received trial-by-trial feedback while repeatedly rating their positive affect. Results show that self-compassion buffered against declines in self-esteem among poorly performing individuals, predicted higher overall positive affect throughout the task, and was associated with increased post-task self-esteem. Moreover, performance feedback predicted positive affect, which in turn predicted post-task self-esteem, although these pathways were not moderated by self-compassion. Together, these findings add to the growing evidence for how self-compassion impacts positive affect and self-esteem and may inform treatment strategies for clinical populations characterized by low self-esteem or heightened self-criticism.",

    "title": "Autonomic reflex plasticity associates with time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in a murine model with hyperactive stress circuits",
    "content": "Sudden unexpected death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with Epilepsy. Although SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory arrest, its underlaying mechanisms are poorly understood. Considering the significant association between stress-related disorders and Epilepsy, we hypothesized that stress exaggerates autonomic reflexes critical in cardiorespiratory function and that these exaggerated reflexes increase susceptibility to SUDEP. Experiments were performed using a novel mouse model of SUDEP where chronic hyperactivity of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Kcc2/Crh) predisposes mice to SUDEP in the weeks following seizure induction based on the ventral intrahippocampal kainate (vIHKA) model of chronic Epilepsy. In our study, the vIHKA model was employed in both wild-type (WT) and Kcc2/Crh mice while they were monitored with EEG and ECG using in vivo telemetry and underwent terminal autonomic reflex testing at time points when mortality peaked and plateaued. A resting tachycardia developed by one week following vIHKA injection but subsided by day 30 in both WT and Kcc2/Crh mice. During spontaneous seizures, Kcc2/Crh mice had more pronounced reflex-like ictal bradycardias compared to WT controls that notably occurred just prior to seizure termination. vIHKA injection promoted time-dependent exaggeration of autonomic reflexes, with Kcc2/Crh mice exhibiting robust autonomic disturbances compared to WT controls, including a pronounced serotonin-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased autonomic disturbance burden parallels time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in mice with hyperactive stress circuits.",

    "title": "Unveiling early visual cortical mechanisms in perceptual filling-in: a parametric study of eccentricity and movement dependence",
    "content": "Surface perception relies on interactions between boundary encoding and surface filling-in. In a perceptual filling-in paradigm, a blank figure becomes perceptually replaced by a textured background after prolonged fixation of a point away from the figure. Filling-in begins when neurons representing the figure's boundary adapt, allowing background-related activity to spread into the figure's retinotopic representation. Adaptation proceeds faster the better the boundary is stabilized in a neuron's receptive field (RF). We hypothesized that moving the figure boundary beyond a neuron's RF would reduce adaptation and hinder filling-in, with larger movements permitting progressively less filling-in. As RF size increases with eccentricity, we further hypothesized that greater eccentricities would require larger movements to interfere with filling-in. Our results confirmed both predictions. The reduction in filling-in duration with increasing motion range permitted estimating RF size at each eccentricity. The slope of a linear function relating RF size to eccentricity matched values reported in human fMRI studies of V1/V2, suggesting that boundary adaptation involves early visual areas. We also explored whether microsaccade amplitude affects filling-in, but found no supporting evidence. Thus, external figure motion and microsaccades may disrupt adaptation through different mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into neural adaptation processes preceding perceptual filling-in.",

    "content": "The phenomenon of cross-excitation - interaction between neurons of a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in intact organism, presents a great challenge since its discovery. It can not be addressed to classical neuron-neuron interactions, as the mentioned neurons are believed to be physiologically isolated by glial sheaths from one another. In this work we test existing hypotheses which explain the phenomenon from both biophysical and statistical perspectives. Our conclusion is that neither each proposed mechanism alone, nor interactions of them can adequately describe cross-excitation in normal conditions. We wish to draw greater attention towards the phenomenon, as it seems to be an important part of normal sensory information processing.",

    "content": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, are major global health challenges. Early hypothalamic microinflammation is emerging as a key contributor to the onset of metabolic dysfunction, but its temporal dynamics, underlying mechanisms, and sex-specific differences remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of short-term high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on hypothalamic microinflammation, glial activation, and insulin signaling in male and female mice. Males rapidly developed hypothalamic microinflammation, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and impaired insulin signaling, whereas females did not show these alterations. Interestingly, we also observed a sex-specific pattern in microglial M2 polarization: females maintained a sustained M2 response throughout the experimental period, while males exhibited only a transient peak that declined in the following days. These sex-specific differences in microglial dynamics and polarization may be linked to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, a classical mediator of inflammatory signaling. To further explore this, we analyzed mice lacking JNK3, the CNS-enriched isoform of JNK. Loss of JNK3 disrupted early microglial polarization, abolished the transient M2 response, and predisposed males to enhanced gliosis and partial hypothalamic insulin resistance, while females retained partial resilience. These findings indicate that JNK3 contributes to the regulation of microglial dynamics and polarization in response to metabolic stress. Overall, our study highlights a sex-dependent role of microglia and JNK in shaping early hypothalamic microinflammation and central insulin sensitivity, providing potential targets for intervention in obesity-associated metabolic disease.",

    "title": "Autonomic Indicators of Self-Transcendence: Insights from the Numadelic VR Paradigm",
    "content": "Self-transcendent experiences (STEs) offer profound and beneficial shifts in perspective, yet remain largely inaccessible outside elite contemplative or pharmacological contexts. Neural measures have deepened our understanding of these states, but their cost and limited ecological validity constrain broader application. This study evaluates heart rate variability (HRV) amplitude, a measure reflecting dynamic sympathovagal balance, as a cost-effective and sustainable physiological marker of STE during numadelic virtual reality (VR) experiences, multi-person, immersive journeys that can induce STE through dissolving self-boundaries and fostering embodied presence. Building on previous work linking non-ordinary states of consciousness with autonomic nervous system activity during psychedelic drug administration, we tested the hypothesis that HRV amplitude may reflect STE depth and predict affective and prosocial outcomes during non-drug numadelic VR experiences. Specifically, ninety-six participants engaged in guided meditation within either a numadelic VR setting or a non-VR audio-guided group format. Physiological data (cardiac activity and respiration) were recorded during the meditation, alongside psychological assessments pre- and post-session. Findings confirm that HRV amplitude measured during numadelic VR correlates with subjective STE ratings, compassion traits, and emotional improvement following VR practice. Additional analysis of data from a prior psychedelic drug study further validated the relevance of this measure across consciousness expanding modalities. These results advance the psychophysiological mapping of STEs and highlight HRV amplitude as a potential real-time biomarker which may help to guide participants toward self-transcendent states within adaptive environments. By integrating contemplative science with immersive design, this work supports the development of scalable tools that enhance both access to and understanding of STEs.",

    "title": "Graded regulation of microtubule-binding of Tau by the phosphorylation state of the proline-rich region in living neurons",
    "content": "Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal morphology and axonal transport. While phosphorylation is known to regulate Tau-microtubule interactions, the contribution of specific phosphorylation patterns in situ remains poorly understood due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. In this study, we combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with dephosphorylation-mimetic mutations and computational modeling to analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Tau-microtubule interaction. We particularly focused on the proline-rich region, of which phosphorylation has been studied in physiological and pathological perspectives, and generated a dephosphorylation-mimetic Tau mutant by substituting key phosphorylation sites with alanine residues and compared its microtubule-binding dynamics to those of WT-Tau in FRAP experiments. Experimental data, together with simulation-based parameter exploration, revealed that the overall number of phosphorylated sites plays a more dominant role than their specific locations in modulating Tau-microtubule affinity. These findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Tau and establish a computational-experimental framework for interrogating intracellular protein dynamics.",

    "title": "Excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway triggers adult-onset motor axonal degeneration",
    "content": "Axonal and synaptic degeneration are key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we performed an unbiased forward genetic mosaic screen to identify genes required for maintenance of adult motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the Drosophila leg. We identified 49 mutations in 30 genes, including mutations in 8 genes resulting in adult-onset progressive degeneration. We found that loss of pebbled (peb) function results in adult-onset motor axonal and NMJ degeneration, and age-dependent motor deficits. Peb is the Drosophila RREB1 ortholog, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that negatively regulates transcription of RAS/MAPK pathway target genes. Loss of peb function resulted in excessive RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and loss of function of other negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway also induced adult-onset progressive NMJ degeneration and motor deficits. Importantly, treatment of adult flies with the MEK1/2 inhibitor mirdametinib induced a dosage-dependent rescue of peb mutant motor neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, RAS/MAPK pathway overactivation results in adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration, which can be prevented by RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition.",

    "title": "GluTrooper: a novel reporter mouse line for whole-brain imaging of glutamate dynamics",
    "content": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. However, tools to image glutamate dynamics in the whole brain with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. Therefore, we developed GluTrooper, a novel mouse line engineered for inducible and long-lasting expression of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3. GluTrooper mice crossed with Emx1-Cre lines demonstrated uniform and stable sensor expression in excitatory neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. iGluSnFR3 expression remained stable for at least 12 months, enabling longitudinal observations of glutamate dynamics over extended periods. Using multimodal imaging in awake mice, we demonstrated the versatility of GluTrooper across multiple spatial scales: from mesoscale widefield cortical imaging to cellular resolution with two-photon microscopy. Moreover, during cortical spreading depolarization, bilateral whole-brain glutamate dynamics and contralateral cortical disinhibition were detected with high fidelity. Accordingly, the GluTrooper may open new avenues for the better understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.",

    "content": "Missense variants in O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) result in OGT congenital disorder of glycosylation (OGT-CDG), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis and a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme responsible for removing protein O-GlcNAcylation, has been explored as a target for modulating brain O-GlcNAc homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and may also be a target for OGT-CDG. Here, we describe an OGT-CDG mouse line that exhibits microcephaly, motor deficits, and brain O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis, closely mirroring patient symptoms. We genetically explored OGA as a target for OGT-CDG by crossing these mice with a line carrying catalytically inactive OGA. Encouragingly, this partially restored O-GlcNAc homeostasis in brain and blood, although it did not result in significant phenotypic rescue. These findings suggest that OGA inhibition can modulate enzymatic imbalance in OGT-CDG mice, and that blood can be used to monitor the effects of interventions targeting O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis.",

    "content": "Human viewers are able to perform tasks that depend on accurate estimates of surface reflectance, even across large changes in illumination and context. This is a remarkable ability, and successful image-computable models of how the visual system achieves this have remained elusive. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed that are adept at estimating surface reflectance. Here we evaluated one such network as a starting point for a new model of human lightness perception by testing whether it was susceptible to a range of classic lightness illusions. We implemented a CNN and trained it via supervised learning to estimate surface reflectance at each pixel in grayscale, rendered images of geometric objects. We examined the network's output on several illusions, including the argyle, Koffka, snake, simultaneous contrast, White's, and checkerboard illusions, as well as control figures. We included variants where low-luminance regions important to the illusions were generated either by low reflectance or by cast shadows. For comparison, we carried out a lightness matching experiment with human observers using the same stimuli, and also examined the outputs of three classic lightness and brightness models. The CNN largely removed lighting effects such as shading and shadows, and produced good reflectance estimates on a test set. It also qualitatively predicted the illusions perceived by humans in most cases, the exceptions being White's and checkerboard illusions. The CNN outperformed classical models, both at estimating reflectance and at tracking human lightness matches. These findings support a normative view of lightness perception and highlight the promise of deep learning models in this area.",

    "title": "Sex-specific trajectories of gait adaptation following partial dopaminergic lesions in a rat model of parkinsons disease",
    "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which gait disturbances are central to disability, yet their early manifestations remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of identifying prodromal PD in humans. Rodent models may help narrow this gap by approximating partial dopaminergic loss and enabling investigation of motor changes that precede overt symptoms. Here, we examined gait dynamics in Wistar rats following unilateral, low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animals were assessed weekly for six weeks in the horizontal ladder test, where running velocity and footfall accuracy were quantified with markerless pose estimation using DeepLabCut (DLC). Lesioned animals exhibited greater tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-reactivity asymmetry than controls, reflected behaviorally as persistent but gradually attenuating deficits in gait precision. Errors peaked at week three and remained above baseline through week six. Velocity was preserved across groups, but sex differences emerged. Control females accelerated more steeply over time, whereas lesioned females showed attenuated gains and greater variability, while males displayed more homogeneous velocity profiles across conditions. Together, these findings indicate that partial SNc lesions reveal sex-specific trajectories of motor adaptation, a feature relevant to modeling prodromal PD. Combined with DLC-based tracking, this framework offers a practical approach for detecting early behavioral markers and supporting the identification of preclinical motor features of PD.",

    "content": "Nociceptors detect damaging stimuli and evoke pain in healthy animals. We conducted an optogenetic activation screen to identify genetically defined nociceptor populations that elicit place aversion and nocifensive behaviors in response to stimulation. Smr2Cre- and Bmpr1bCre-labeled A{delta} high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) emerged as two of the few nociceptor populations, and we focused on investigating their physiological, morphological, functional, and synaptic properties. These neurons densely innervate skin and other organs, are activated only by intense, potentially damaging stimuli, and are necessary for protective responses to sharp mechanical stimuli. Centrally, A{delta}-HTMRs projections span multiple spinal segments and terminate across spinal cord laminae, forming strong, monosynaptic connections onto anterolateral tract projection neurons, including antenna cells of the deep dorsal horn. A{delta}-HTMRs also engage a local spinal reflex circuit enabling a remarkably rapid limb withdrawal. Thus, A{delta}-HTMRs are myelinated nociceptors with unique properties that can be exploited for development of new analgesics.",

    "content": "The neuroscience of habits in humans presumes a winner-takes-all contest between two systems: stimulus-response and goal-directed. But lacking strong causal manipulations for inducing habits in humans, researchers have struggled to understand the brain mechanisms supporting the development of stimulus-response associations over time and their interaction with goal-directed processes. To address this, we conducted a preregistered 14-day within-subject electroencephalography (EEG) study and used tight temporal controls to isolate the functioning of each system. We found both causal and correlational evidence that the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) can serve as a covert neural signature for habits, detectable on trials where inappropriate habits are overcome and behavior is classed as goal-directed. We found evidence that stronger habits required more frontal midline theta (FM{theta}) power to successfully inhibit them, supporting the view that the goal-directed system competes with stimulus-response representations. These data showcase the hidden role of multiple brain systems in habit expression and provide a new window into the formation and override of habits.",

    "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) studies in psychiatry have produced highly inconsistent findings, particularly in case-control designs. Small sample sizes are widely assumed to contribute to this variability, yet their impact on the reliability of EEG group comparisons has not been systematically quantified at scale. Here, we address this key gap using a large multisite resting-state EEG dataset comprising 2,874 participants aged 5-18 years, including individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, learning disorders, and healthy controls. We extracted a comprehensive set of spectral, temporal, and complexity EEG features and performed repeated case-control comparisons across a wide range of sample sizes using extensive random subsampling. Results from small samples were unstable, with inflated and highly variable effect sizes across iterations. By contrast, larger samples produced consistent and reproducible findings, converging on uniformly small but robust effects. Statistical power rose steeply with sample size, whereas false positive rates remained relatively stable. These results demonstrate the central role of sample size in shaping EEG study outcomes and challenge the utility of conventional case-control approaches for biomarker discovery in psychiatry.",

    "content": "The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value, i.e. whether environmental cues are good or bad. Rewarding cue value is aligned with a tendency to act or to inhibit in case of potential punishment, a so-called Pavlovian Bias. Value-related vmPFC activation may therefore impact Pavlovian bias. However, it remains unknown how the activity in the vmPFC modulates the Pavlovian bias. Thus, we applied continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive protocol that transiently reduces cortical excitability, over the vmPFC in a single-blinded, between-subject study. 90 healthy adults performed a motivational Go/NoGo learning task during fMRI after receiving cTBS (n=45) or sham (n=45) stimulation. Behaviourally, cTBS reduced overall Go response rates and slowed reaction times. Computational modelling showed a decrease in the learning rate, selectively for rewarding outcomes. Computational fMRI analysis showed stronger reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the vmPFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and left dorsal striatum after cTBS, without changes in neural signals at cue onset. These findings provide causal evidence that the vmPFC drives the action-invigoration component of the Pavlovian bias.",

    "content": "The 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is widely recognized as a biomarker of neuroinflammation, but recent evidence suggests that it may also play a direct role in the pathophysiology of neurological conditions with an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we leveraged functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to assess how TSPO knockout influences brain activity and connectivity in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD. Resting-state scans were performed in 16-month-old male and female mice across four genotypes: WT, TSPO-/-, 3xTgAD or 3xTgAD.TSPO-/-. Using a data-driven approach, we identified key functional networks, including a bilateral hippocampal-amygdala limbic network. Dual regression analysis revealed increased engagement of the ventral hippocampus within the limbic network and elevated hemodynamic variance in 3xTgAD mice compared to WT. Moreover, co-activation patterns (CAPs) analysis showed abnormal activation/deactivation cycles involving the dorsal hippocampus, both of which were prevented by TSPO knockout without affecting amyloid or tau burden. Our findings highlight a functional role for TSPO in shaping network dynamics and suggest that its deletion can mitigate brain dysfunction in AD models.",

    "title": "Locally balanced inhibition allows for robust learning of input-output associations in feedforward networks with Hebbian plasticity",
    "content": "In neural networks within the brain, the activity of a post-synaptic neuron is determined by the combined influence of many pre-synaptic neurons. This distributed processing enables mechanisms like Hebbian plasticity to associate sensory inputs with specific internal states, as seen in feedforward structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus. By modifying synaptic weights through Hebbian rules, sensory inputs can subsequently elicit outputs that consistently reflect their corresponding internal states. When input and output patterns are uncorrelated, this approach allows for the encoding of a large number of distinct associations, enabling efficient memory storage. Our study demonstrates a critical limitation when output patterns become weakly correlated with input patterns through the intrinsic feedforward network's connectivity. In these cases, the Hebbian rule preferentially strengthens synaptic weights shared across patterns, leading to a \"freezing\" of the network's structure. This results in highly correlated output patterns over time, effectively reducing the network's capacity to store diverse associations and limiting its flexibility in learning. To address this challenge, we find that including a mechanism of locally balanced inhibition, which has been shown to be a key feature of cortical circuits in-vivo, counteracts the undesired correlations between inputs and outputs. By dynamically regulating inhibitory input, locally balanced inhibition prevents the over-strengthening of shared weights, restoring the network's ability to maintain robust and flexible learning. This finding underscores the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in enabling efficient and adaptive information processing in neural circuits, offering insights into how biological networks maintain their remarkable capacity for associative learning.",

    "content": "Skilled reaching behaviors, such as grasping a cup or catching a ball, require adaptive changes in response to error signals. Our natural reaches are usually coordinated with preceding eye movements. Despite this behavioral relevance, the potential linkage between preceding eye movements and memory formation for reaching has been largely overlooked. We show that two opposing visuomotor maps for reach, which normally prevent learning due to interference, can be learned when each is associated with a different immediately preceding eye movement. We further show that the generalization pattern of reach learning across different gaze conditions can be explained by the gaze state's distance computed with temporal weighting. These findings indicate that reaching memories are encoded in tight association with the recent history of preceding gaze states. Our results expand the functional role of eye-hand coordination beyond visual guidance, revealing its importance in orchestrating flexible motor learning.",

SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls).

The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>How I Found (and Fixed) a 14x Cost Bug in Airbyte's S3 Connector</h1> <p>We've all heard the &quot;cloud horror stories.&quot; A $50,000 AWS bill over a weekend. A $100k charge in 12 hours from a runaway Lambda. These aren't just myths; they're bugs. And they're almost always in the application code.</p> <p>I've become obsessed with this problem: FinOps tools tell you what you spent, but never why the code spent it.</p> <p>So I went hunting. I decided to manually audit the codebase of Airbyte, a massive and high-quality open-source data platform, to see if I could find a &quot;cloud cost bug&quot; in the wild.</p> <h1>Then I Found It.</h1> <p>Inside the S3 source connector (<code>source-s3/v4/zip_reader.py</code>), I found a subtle but powerful N+1 bug. The code was trying to find a &quot;signature&quot; (a sequence of bytes) at the end of a ZIP file.</p> <p>To do this, it was calling <code>get_object</code> inside a while loop, repeatedly asking for a slightly bigger chunk of the same file.</p> <h1>The &quot;Before&quot; Code (The Bug):</h1> <pre><code># ... file_size = self.s3_client.head_object(...) buffer_size = initial_buffer_size while buffer_size &lt;= max_buffer_size: # This get_object call is inside a loop! chunk = self._fetch_data_from_s3(filename, file_size - buffer_size) index = chunk.rfind(signature) if index != -1: return chunk[index:] buffer_size *= 2 # Double the buffer and try again return None </code></pre> <h1>Why This Is a 14x Cost Multiplier</h1> <p>This while loop could execute up to 14 times to find the signature. That means 14 separate <code>get_object</code> API calls for every single file processed.</p> <p>10,000 files processed = 140,000 GET requests</p> <p>Expected behavior = 10,000 GET requests</p> <p>This is a 14x cost multiplier hidden in a place no &quot;Accountant&quot; dashboard would ever find.</p> <h1>The Fix: One Call, Not Fourteen</h1> <p>The fix is to fetch the entire max-sized chunk once and search for the signature in memory.</p> <h1>The &quot;After&quot; Code (The Fix):</h1> <pre><code># ... file_size = self.s3_client.head_object(...) # Calculate the start byte for the single largest chunk start_byte = max(0, file_size - max_buffer_size) # Make ONE call for the whole chunk chunk = self._fetch_data_from_s3(filename, start_byte) # Search in memory index = chunk.rfind(signature) if index != -1: return chunk[index:] return None </code></pre> <p>This simple refactor reduces 14 API calls to just 1 (plus the <code>head_object</code>), cutting the API cost for this operation by over 90%.</p> <h1>This is Why We Need &quot;Cost-Aware&quot; Linters</h1> <p>This bug is subtle. It's not &quot;wrong,&quot; it's just expensive. It's the exact kind of thing that slips past code review and creates a &quot;horror story&quot; bill.</p> <p>Manually finding this was a pain, so I'm building a free, open-source GitHub Action called <strong>Wozz</strong> to find these &quot;cost bugs&quot; in PRs automatically.</p> <p>You can check out the free linter here: <a href=\"http://github.com/WozzHQ/wozz\"><code>github.com/WozzHQ/wozz</code></a></p> <p><strong>HN Discussion:</strong> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903742\"><strong>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903742</strong></a></p> <p>And the full post (with better formatting) is on my new site: <a href=\"https://wozz.io/airbyte-story.html\"><code>https://wozz.io/airbyte-story.html</code></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/craftcoreai\"> /u/craftcoreai </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ove9is/i_found_a_14x_cloud_cost_bug_in_airbytes_s3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ove9is/i_found_a_14x_cloud_cost_bug_in_airbytes_s3/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p>Successful navigation and interactions with objects in a complex, three-dimensional (3D) world are essential to survival, yet studies of the neural basis of visual perception and action often treat the world as a flat, two-dimensional (2D) canvas. Here, we review recent discoveries about how the visual systems of different mammals have adapted under the constraint of a 3D world. Many neurons in primate visual cortex are sensitive to 3D depth cues constructed from input differences to the two eyes (binocular disparities). Similar neuronal selectivity has recently been characterized in tree shrews and mice, though constrained anatomically and functionally. Disparity-sensitive receptive field structures can now be assessed noninvasively across human visual cortex and functionally linked to depth perception. At later stages in the nonhuman primate (NHP) ventral (\"what\") pathway, supporting object recognition, complex 3D objects are represented as spatial configurations of geometric parts. In studies of the dorsal (\"where\"/\"how\") pathway of NHPs, underlying visuospatial processing, the inclusion of 3D structure in visual tasks has established tighter links between neuronal mechanisms and perception. This has also revealed neuronal representations of 3D object position and orientation that are tolerant to 3D gaze location, providing a basis for robust perception and action. The cross-species analysis presented here provides new perspectives on neural coding mechanisms underpinning the richness of 3D visual experience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential for understanding the neural basis of cognition and behavior, which in turn will enable the development of therapies and neuroprosthetics for those suffering from visual impairments.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is essential for monitoring ongoing behavior, regulating affect, and guiding social interactions. Altered ACC structure and function are implicated in a host of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder. Thus, cross talk between basic and translational research is needed to drive the next generation of treatments. The human and nonhuman primate ACC is large and can be subdivided based on anatomical structure and connectivity. Increasingly, studies of the ACC point to unique functions for its distinct areas. This review highlights recent work aimed at understanding of the structure and function of distinct portions of the ACC and the role of these regions in cognition and affect in higher species. We focus on the roles and subregions that might guide the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. This includes discussion of in-depth anatomical investigations that have revealed that distinct portions of the subgenual and perigenual ACC areas are driven by unique afferent paths. Furthermore, we describe neurophysiological recordings of single-neuron and local field potential activity, combined with carefully designed behavioral tasks or novel approaches to discerning affective states, which have revealed the neural mechanisms engaged in ACC during affective experience and assessment of conspecifics. We present noninvasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches that target the ACC to treat depression and have been shown to be most effective when they change activity within subgenual parts of ACC and may structurally remodel the connections of this area. Finally, we review new approaches to uncover upstream drivers and downstream effectors of ACC activity in higher species, including functional changes implicated in health, disease, and recovery.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pain is a symptom common to a wide variety of conditions and one that severely impacts an individual's everyday life, as well as having broader socioeconomic repercussions. In recent years, there has been spectacularly rapid progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of sensory neuron function and pain in preclinical models. However, the number of analgesics interacting with novel targets that have received regulatory approval in recent years has been limited. Examples include monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies disrupting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling for treating migraine and, most recently, suzetrigine, a small molecular inhibitor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 subunit. In this review, we step away from focusing on the sensory neuron as the transmitter of nociceptive information and examine the role of non-neuronal cells in modulating sensory neuron activity. One potential appeal of disrupting the activity of peripherally located non-neuronal cells is the likely bypassing of side effects associated with modulating a target receptor that is expressed by neurons within both the peripheral and central nervous systems, although targeting of peripheral, non-neuronal cells will not of course necessarily be side effect-free. Here, we examine the key roles of non-neuronal cells in orchestrating pain across a diverse set of conditions, from joint pain to bone pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, Fabry disease, and chronic pain in general.</p>",

This review synthesizes recent insights from rodent research presented at our 2025 Society for Neuroscience minisymposium, detailing how local inhibitory microcircuits, long-range projection&ndash;defined pathways, and neuromodulatory inputs interact to shape fear, anxiety, and reward behaviors. We emphasize how distinct circuits segregate fear and anxiety, resolve approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, and integrate reward history. Serotonergic modulation, particularly from the median raphe, emerges as a critical regulator of vHPC dynamics, with pronounced sex-specific functional implications. Finally, we examine how vCA1 ensemble activity encodes emotionally salient stimuli and supports latent state inference, thereby enabling flexible decision-making under uncertainty. Collectively, these findings recast the vHPC as a modular, computationally rich structure essential for adaptive behavior, which may provide new insights into circuit-level dysfunction in affective disorders.</p>",

This process involved not only increased cortical surface area and neuronal output but also enhanced structural adaptations, such as cortical folding and glial morphological complexity. In this review, we examine the central roles of radial glia (RG) and astrocytes in driving neocortical expansion and evolution. We highlight the emergence of primate- and human-specific genes, which contribute to enhanced RG proliferation and neurogenesis in these species. We further explore how epigenetic regulation and dynamic chromatin architecture modulate RG behavior across species. At the cellular level, we discuss how morphological features&mdash;particularly the basal processes and specialized protrusions of RG&mdash;facilitate access to diverse extrinsic signals, promoting proliferative capacity and cortical complexity. We then turn to cortical folding, focusing on the role of astrocytes, and the functional relevance of folds in supporting brain homeostasis. Finally, we address astrocyte diversity, development, and evolutionary adaptation, with special emphasis on sex differences and primate-specific features. Comparative transcriptomic and morphological studies reveal that human astrocytes exhibit unique molecular signatures, expanded metabolic capacity, and higher morphological complexity. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted contributions of RG and astrocytes to the evolutionary elaboration of the neocortex. They further provide a framework for understanding how cellular innovations shaped the modern primate brain in general, and human brain specifically.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates postsynaptic strength to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling. Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling in cultured rat neurons of either sex. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Furthermore, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3 and thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluRs that are necessary for upscaling. Altogether, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling is thought to require agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up- and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.</p>",

    "title": "Behavior-Relevant Periodized Neural Representation of Acoustic But Not Tactile Rhythm in Humans",
    "content": "<p>Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat and the related \"periodized\" neural representation are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex. The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15&nbsp;Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior. In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25&nbsp;Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization and yielded less stable tapping. Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat. Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses. More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 males, 20 females) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudorandom intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including the heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340&ndash;356&nbsp;ms window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal&mdash;a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Diverse network oscillations, thought to represent different information processing modes of cortical networks, are accompanied by synchronous neuronal activity at various temporal scales. Sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, supporting memory consolidation in the hippocampus, are among the fastest physiological oscillations characterized by strong interneuronal synchrony. In contrast, when hippocampal activity turns epileptic, pathological fast-ripple oscillations appear. The distinction of the two oscillations is diagnostically relevant; however, how differential mechanisms of the same network generate the two activities is not well understood. Here we addressed this question using an in vitro hippocampal model that allowed targeted recording of cell types and local pharmacological manipulations in mice of either sex. We showed that inhibition did not contribute to current and rhythm generation of fast-ripples, unlike physiological ripple oscillations. Instead, pathological fast-ripples emerged when perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells collapsed and depended on the quasi-simultaneous onset of stereotypical pyramidal cell (PC) bursts leading to pseudosynchrony. This was accompanied by a loss of spatial coherence. In epileptogenic conditions, deep CA3 PCs selectively ramped up their burst activity before fast-ripple onset, while normally nonbursting superficial PCs acquired burst capability. These results point to PC pseudosynchrony as the underlying mechanism of fast-ripples, with differential contribution of known PC types.</p>",

    "content": "Protectin DX (PDX) is a member of the superfamily of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and exerts anti-inflammatory actions in animal models; but the specific signaling pathways involved in its actions have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate the analgesic actions of PDX in a mouse model of tibial fracture-induced postoperative pain (fPOP) via activation of GPR37. Intravenous early-phase and late-phase treatment of PDX (100 ng/mouse) effectively alleviated fPOP. Compared to protectin D1/neuroprotectin D1, DHA, steroid, and meloxicam, PDX produced superior pain relief. While dexamethasone and meloxicam prolonged fPOP, PDX shortened the pain duration. The analgesic effects of PDX were abrogated in Gpr37 knockout mice, which displayed deficits in fPOP resolution. PDX binds GPR37 and induces calcium responses in peritoneal macrophages. LC-MS-MS-based lipidomic analysis revealed that endogenous PDX levels were ~10-fold higher than PD1 in muscle at the fracture site. PDX promotes macrophage polarization via GPR37-dependent phagocytosis and efferocytosis through calcium signaling in vitro, and it further enhances macrophage viability and efferocytosis in vivo via GPR37. Finally, PDX rapidly modulates nociceptor neuron responses by suppressing C-fiber-induced muscle reflex in vivo and calcium responses in DRG neurons ex vivo and reducing TRPA1/TRPV1-induced acute pain and neurogenic inflammation in vivo. Our findings highlight multiple benefits of PDX to manage postoperative pain and promote perioperative recovery.",

    "content": "Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL, Batten Disease) is a childhood-onset, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal gene CLN3. Progressive cognitive decline is a key clinical manifestation of JNCL, and no definitive treatment is currently available. The precise function of CLN3 in neurons remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted therapies. Using patch-clamp and AAV-mediated re-expression of CLN3 in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice, we demonstrate that CLN3 is essential for synaptic function. Loss of CLN3 caused defective synaptic vesicle release and reduced synaptic strength reflecting impairments in both pre- and postsynaptic function in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice before the occurrence of neurodegeneration. Moreover, we observed reduced network bursting and deficits in intrinsic neuronal excitability, indicating early functional disturbances independent of storage burden and neuronal death in CLN3-deficient mice. To assess whether CLN3 is required for proper pre- and postsynaptic function, we re-expressed CLN3 selectively in pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We found non-redundant requirements at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to sustain function. Importantly, AAV9-mediated gene rescue at early-disease stages corrected preexisting synaptic defects and restored function. Together, these findings demonstrate the requirement of CLN3 in maintaining synaptic function and show that the therapeutic window may extend to stages characterized by early functional deficits, highlighting the potential of targeted gene therapy to restore function and improve cognitive outcomes.",

    "title": "Wake consolidates event memory, sleep binds it with context",
    "content": "Sleep is thought to be superior to wakefulness in consolidating memory, due to a hippocampus-driven process enhancing the contextual integration of events. We compared recall of associative memory in different contexts, and found that memory is also consolidated during wakefulness, although in a qualitatively distinct way. Healthy participants performed a cued stimulus-response (S-R) learning task requiring speeded object classification. Learning was followed by 2 hours of sleep or wakefulness. Reaction times revealed stronger S-R memory after sleep than wakefulness with retrieval in the same context, and this benefit was linked to increased sleep spindle activity. In contrast, S-R memory was stronger after wakefulness than sleep when tested in a different context. This wake-dependent enhancement had a fast onset and was reversed by delayed sleep. We conclude that, unlike sleep strengthening the binding of an event with its context, wakefulness stabilizes event representations itself, i.e., not bound to a specific context.",

    "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
    "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",

    "title": "PIAS1/PIAS4-Mediated SUMOylation of TDP-43 is Induced by Oxidative Stress",
    "content": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a conserved RNA and DNA binding protein that functions in transcriptional repression, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA stabilization. Under pathological conditions found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 shows aberrant mislocalization from the nucleus and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation. TDP-43 also appears to play a role in DNA damage repair, specifically in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), suggesting that nuclear depletion of TDP-43 may contribute towards the accumulation of DNA damage observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These TDP-43 pathological inclusions are decorated with post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation. SUMOylation (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) is a dynamic post-translational modification that regulates many protein properties and is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology. DNA damage repair proteins are commonly regulated through SUMOylation, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for efficient DNA repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Given these findings, we investigated TDP-43 SUMOylation and whether SUMO modification impacts TDP-43s DNA damage repair function. We show that TDP-43 can be modified by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 and confirm SUMOylation in response to oxidative stress. We also determine which regions of TDP-43 are SUMOylated and show that this modification is facilitated by the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4. Etoposide-induced DNA damage did not promote SUMOylation of TDP-43; studies are ongoing to determine the impact of TDP-43 SUMOylation on DNA repair.",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN, this is David from Aluna (YC S24). We work with diagnostic labs to build datasets and evals for oncology tasks.<p>I wanted to share a simple RL environment I built that gave frontier LLMs a set of tools that lets it zoom and pan across a digitized pathology slide to find the relevant regions to make a diagnosis. \nHere are some videos of the LLM performing diagnosis on a few slides:<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ixTWswT5c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ixTWswT5c</a>): traces of an LLM choosing different regions to view before making a diagnosis on a case of small-cell carcinoma of the lung<p>(<a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=0cMbqLnKkGU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=0cMbqLnKkGU</a>): traces of an LLM choosing different regions to view before making a diagnosis on a case of benign fibroadenoma of the breast<p>Why I built this:<p>Pathology slides are the backbone of modern cancer diagnosis. Tissue from a biopsy is sliced, stained, and mounted on glass for a pathologist to examine abnormalities.<p>Today, many of these slides are digitized into whole-slide images (WSIs)in TIF or SVS format and are several gigabytes in size.<p>While there exists several pathology-focused AI models, I was curious to test whether frontier LLMs can perform well on pathology-based tasks. The main challenge is that WSIs are too large to fit into an LLM\u2019s context window. The standard workaround, splitting them into thousands of smaller tiles, is inefficient for large frontier LLMs.<p>Inspired by how pathologists zoom and pan under a microscope, I built a set of tools that let LLMs control magnification and coordinates, viewing small regions at a time and deciding where to look next.<p>This ended up resulting in some interesting behaviors, and actually seemed to yield pretty good results with prompt engineering:<p>- GPT 5: explored up to ~30 regions before deciding (concurred with an expert pathologist on 4 out of 6 cancer subtyping tasks and 3 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>- Claude 4.5: Typically used 10\u201315 views but similar accuracy as GPT-5 (concurred with the pathologist on 3 out of 6 cancer subtyping tasks and 4 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>- Smaller models (GPT 4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku): examined ~8 frames and were less accurate overall (1 out of 6 cancer subtytping tasks and 1 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>Obviously, this was a small sample set, so we are working on creating a larger benchmark suite with more cases and types of tasks, but I thought this was cool that it even worked so I wanted to share with HN!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902590\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902590</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Launch HN: JSX Tool (YC F25) \u2013 A Browser Dev-Panel IDE for React",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, We\u2019re Jamie & Dan, building JSX Tool (<a href=\"https://jsxtool.com\">https://jsxtool.com</a>) a new inspector/dev panel IDE that allows you to navigate to any line of your React project\u2019s JSX with just a click and a command click to explore your render stack.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs</a><p>I\u2019ve been writing React code for nearly a decade. Since I first saw source maps in the days of Babel and Redux, I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to edit my code from the source maps. I\u2019ve also always wanted to be able to inspect my JSX like it was HTML.<p>Last year, I found my first real use of AI was taking ad-hoc CSS changes in the Chrome element inspector, pasting them into ChatGPT, and asking for the equivalent in Tailwind. I\u2019d then paste those changes into my React TSX files.<p>I wanted to streamline this process but came to the conclusion that to do so I needed to build a JSX inspector. I had to write a custom AST parser to create a mapping between the JSX and HTML. So I hacked on an inspector for a couple of months that connected JSX to the DOM in both directions.<p>The next feature was adding a CSS editor, like the one in the browser inspectors but for JSX. Unlike styling a piece of HTML I decided that any in memory style edits to a React fiber should be globally applied, as if you had tweaked that line of code in your codebase.<p>Finally, I was able to add the two AI features I really wanted: (1) prompt for in-memory styles for when I was pixel tweaking, and (2) save those temporary changes back to my codebase in the convention of the codebase I was working in.<p>To accomplish talking to the filesystem from the Chrome extension I built a little local server that mounts from the root of your project and allows the extension to send file-system commands back to your project root. We named this the \u201cDev Server\u201d. (Note: You can fully use us as a JSX inspector without this server installed.)<p>After all that, I found that to convert myself as a user I needed it to be a pretty fully functional IDE. I needed vim bindings, I needed a typechecker, I needed auto-complete, I needed a linter, I needed code search and I needed a proper file explorer. Fortunately we were able to take advantage of the dev-server architecture we had stumbled onto in order to add an LSP server and Rip Grep. At this point, after months of dog fooding, I use JSX Tool for almost all of my website edits.<p>We\u2019re still rough around the edges for mobile but we\u2019re working on that.<p>All of the IDE stuff not involving AI is free and works fine without AI. We let you get a taste of the prompting stuff for free but apply some rate limits.<p>The extension itself is not open source but the dev server with the LSP is. It\u2019s a great foundation if you want to build any sort of in-browser IDE and it's nearly React agnostic. Building the dev server was a big undertaking so I\u2019d love to see someone fork it and find value in it.<p>In the future we want to start adding things that we are in a position to take advantage of over something like Cursor, such as letting AI give you code suggestions for runtime exceptions or work with the network logs. We think that the convenience of having your IDE in the dev panel gives us a leg up in convenience and workflow context.<p>Anyway, regardless of how you feel about AI coding, I wanted to make something that was useful with or without AI. We\u2019d love it if you gave it a spin and we want to share anything we can about the technical side of the product that you might find interesting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "title": "The effects of Alcohol Dependence on the CSF Proteome in Mice: Evidence for Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction and Neuroinflammation",
    "content": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant neurological health burden, yet the biological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced brain pathology remain incompletely understood. Moreover, the molecular underpinnings of the transition from alcohol exposure to alcohol dependence are not well-characterized. We used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in a preliminary discovery study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of alcohol-exposed Non-dependent (Non-dep) versus alcohol-dependent (Dep) mice that underwent the chronic intermittent ethanol (alcohol) - two-bottle choice (CIE-2BC) procedure and systemic anti-IL-6 Receptor antibody administration. CSF samples from individual mice were processed for proteomic analysis and digested with trypsin overnight. Peptides were analyzed via data-independent acquisition (DIA)-MS and data were processed in DIA-NN at 1% FDR. We identified 611 unique proteins across both groups, with 140 proteins differentially detected in CSF from Dep mice and 67 proteins specific to alcohol-exposed but Non-dep controls. The Dep-specific proteins revealed signatures of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, cellular stress responses, and complement system activation. In contrast, Non-dep-specific proteins indicated preserved protective mechanisms including complement regulation, anti-inflammatory signaling, and neuronal calcium homeostasis. Ethanol-dependent-specific findings include MMP2, BIP, and to a lesser extent VE-cadherin (CDH5) and VCAM1, indicative of the beginnings of endothelial damage and BBB disruption, alongside established neuroinflammation markers GFAP, CHI3L1, and CX3CL1. This work provides novel preliminary protein-level evidence that alcohol exposure and alcohol dependence are dichotomous; despite the small sample size and limited power for moderate effect sizes, there appears to be a clear molecular transition from maintained protective mechanisms to vascular damage, BBB breakdown, and sustained neuroinflammation.",

    "title": "The Primate Hippocampus Constructs a Temporal Scaffold Anchored to Behavioral Events",
    "content": "The hippocampus has been shown to support a variety of cognitive functions, ranging from spatial navigation to anxiety regulation to memory formation, but how its moment-to-moment neuronal activity contributes to cognition remains poorly understood. The activity of single hippocampal neurons is correlated with numerous perceptual features and task variables, raising the question of whether these response properties reflect distinct mechanisms or a single generalized computation. Here, we show that diverse hippocampal responses reflect unified event-driven dynamics in which population activity transitions between discrete ensemble states at behaviorally salient events. Recording from monkeys performing a virtual spatial alternation task, we found that population activity did not evolve smoothly over time but instead transitioned abruptly at each relevant event. These discontinuities segmented activity into distinct ensemble codes, effectively chunking conceptually defined task epochs. Notably, many neuronal responses persisted across visually distinct environments, demonstrating that these dynamics reflect abstract task structure rather than specific sensory features. These results reveal that the hippocampus constructs a temporal scaffold anchored to relevant behavioral events, with each neural state tracking a distinct task phase. This organizational principle may explain the diverse correlates observed across studies: rather than individually encoding task features, hippocampal neurons collectively signal which phase of a behavioral sequence is currently active. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus parses experience into meaningful elements and tracks \"position\" within a learned behavioral structure.",

    "title": "Low-Dimensional and Optimised Representations of High-Level Information in the Expert Brain",
    "content": "What transforms a novice into an expert? While decades of research show that expertise relies on domain-specific knowledge, a neural account of this transformation has remained fragmentary. We lack an understanding of what information expert representations encode, how they are structured for efficient use, and where in the brain they reside. Here, using chess as a model system for outstanding performance, we combine neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analysis to reveal three principles of the expert brain. We show that expertise drives a shift in representational content, from surface visual features to high-level, relational information. This is accompanied by a structural change, to low-dimensional, optimised representation. Neural codes become more compact and better organised for rapid use, yet retain the details needed for precise evaluation. Finally, we find the representational load shifts from sensory-specific cortices to domain-general frontoparietal networks. These principles show how the expert brain packs more into less, concentrating richer knowledge into fewer, better-organised representations that support rapid, flexible decision-making that defines mastery.",

    "title": "Decoding the Valence of Developmental Social Behavior: Dopamine Governs Social Motivation Deficits in Autism",
    "content": "The social motivation theory posits that core social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) arise from impaired social valence assignment during the social critical period, yet the specific dopaminergic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. We combined high-resolution behavioral sequencing (Social-seq) with fiber photometry to resolve nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine during naturalistic juvenile interactions. Sex-divergent social strategies emerged: males exhibited peer play-dominant interactions with action-contingent dopamine release, while females favored environmental exploration with attenuated social dopamine. Shank3-deficient juveniles exhibited a triad of dopaminergic dysregulation-blunted signaling during social investigation, pathological inversion during active play, and hyper-responsive to non-social stimuli-recapitulating ASD-like phenotypes. Closed-loop activation of dopamine during play rescued social deficits, establishing a causal link between phasic dopaminergic signaling and social motivation. These findings identify NAc dopamine as a dynamic encoder of social valence and suggest that temporally precise modulation of dopaminergic circuits may offer therapeutic leverage for ASD-related social impairments.",

    "content": "Understanding human synapse structure and function at nanoscale resolution requires experimental systems that support both high-quality imaging and robust synaptogenesis. While brain tissue and primary neuronal cultures have been widely used, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer key advantages: they enable patient-specific modeling and provide a renewable source of human neurons without relying on animal models. However, reproducible synapse formation in iPSC-derived neurons, particularly motor neurons (MNs), remains challenging due to variable differentiation efficiencies and low synaptic density. Here, we optimized MN differentiation to enhance synaptogenesis and enable high-resolution structural analysis using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Within 28 days, human iPSC-derived MNs developed into morphologically and functionally mature neuronal networks, characterized by phase-bright somata, elongated axons, and dense axodendritic branching. To further promote synaptic connectivity, we applied the glutamatergic modulators CX516 and CDPPB during differentiation. Their effects were validated by immunolabeling of synaptic markers, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, live-cell synaptic vesicle recycling assays, and ultrastructural imaging, including cryo-ET. This combined approach of optimized differentiation and targeted neuromodulation yielded reproducible MN networks with enhanced synaptic density and function, providing a robust in vitro platform for investigating human MN physiology, synaptic mechanisms, and disease-relevant synaptopathies.",

    "content": "Mammals exhibit robust walking across diverse environments, a capability largely attributed to central pattern generators (CPGs) in the spinal cord. Afferent feedback modulates CPG output and plays a critical role in adaptive locomotion, yet its specific contributions remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we used a neuromusculoskeletal model to simulate hindlimb locomotion in spinalized cats encountering a hole and experiencing a sudden loss of ground support, as described in prior experimental studies. The model couples a trunk-and-hindlimb musculoskeletal system to a pair of two-level, half-center CPGs - one for each hindlimb. The model reproduced the observed adaptive interlimb coordination that allows cats to maintain walking after the sudden loss of ground support. Notably, the adaptive response emerged without re-optimizing parameters, which were tuned for steady walking in an environment without holes. Nullcline analysis based on dynamical systems theory revealed that afferent feedback mechanisms controlling the transitions between fast and slow neuronal dynamics facilitated adaptive interlimb coordination. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how spinal feedback circuits support robust locomotion through dynamic interactions between the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, and the environment.",

    "title": "The anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug valproic acid attracts C. elegans and activates chemosensory neurons via a cGMP signaling pathway",
    "content": "Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug with both anticonvulsant and antimanic properties. It has been widely prescribed to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions for decades, but its molecular mode of action in the brain is not fully known. Moreover, prenatal exposure to this drug is linked to developmental anomalies, cognitive deficits, and an increased risk of autism. To determine VPA's effect on the nervous system without requiring systemic drug application and inducing toxic effects, we exploited the well-characterized chemotaxis behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans are attracted to VPA, and this behavior is missing in animals lacking the tax-4 ion channel and the tax-4-expressing AWC chemosensory neurons. To test the idea that VPA directly activates the AWC neurons, we performed calcium imaging studies in a line expressing GCaMP6s in all amphid chemosensory neurons in the head. We found that VPA evoked calcium transients consistently in the AWC neurons and variably in AWB and ASH. As cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the active state of tax-4 increases upon the binding of cGMP. Within the worm's chemosensory nervous system, receptor guanylate cyclases (rGCs) facilitate the synthesis of cGMP and serve as chemoreceptors for various chemical cues. By performing chemotaxis assays and calcium imaging experiments with rGC mutants against VPA, we found that odr-1 and gcy-28 are essential for mediating VPA attraction, as their absence disrupts both behavior and control AWC calcium transients. However, given their broad use in chemosensation, odr-1 and gcy-28 most likely act as downstream effectors rather than as direct targets. These findings compelled us to investigate whether chemoreceptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family contribute to VPA sensing. We approached this hypothesis by conducting chemotaxis assays with G mutants and identified several (odr-3, egl-30, gpa-2;gpa-3) whose absence leads to a loss of VPA attraction. Thus, future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which GPCRs contribute to VPA sensing and cGMP signaling.",

    "title": "Neurogenesis Leads Early Development in Zebrafish",
    "content": "Vertebrate early neurogenesis is a highly conserved process fundamental to brain function and the emergence of intelligence. However, the cellular dynamics bridging gastrulation and organogenesis remain elusive due to observational challenges. We developed a live-cell imaging platform for transgenic zebrafish that provides, for the first time, a continuous reconstruction of early neurogenesis across subcellular to organismal scales. Our analysis reveals that neurogenesis is a precisely orchestrated process. Neuronal cell bodies initially coalesce into discrete, linearly arranged clusters extending from the brain along the spinal cord. From these hubs, axons radiate outward to innervate the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the yolk sac surface. A primary pioneer neuron projects from the brain, coursing ventrally in parallel to the body axis. Secondary neurons then interconnect, forming a pervasive network that is subsequently refined through selective axonal apoptosis. The emergence of frequent Ca2+ flashes only after structural maturation indicates that functionality is contingent upon an established scaffold. We also observe concurrent material transport and a slow, directional flow of Ca2+ along axons, suggesting complementary signaling modalities. Furthermore, neurogenesis exhibits precise spatiotemporal coupling with histogenesis, particularly with the developing lateral line and vasculature. Our work, with refined spatial and time resolution, defines the kinetic pathway of early neurogenesis and underscores the critical interplay of subsystems in embryogenesis, offering fundamental insights for neural health and bio-inspired intelligence.",

    "content": "Deficient extinction learning and memory are hypothesized mechanisms for pathological anxiety that are associated with sleep disturbance. fMRI neural activations to threat conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction recall were measured. Activations were compared, in persons with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), between those with moderate to severe Insomnia Disorder (ID) and those with absent or sub-threshold ID. Relationships of activations with measures of sleep quality and physiology were examined. Between-group comparisons and whole-sample correlation with sleep parameters were examined in relation to large-scale brain networks using a liberal cluster-determining threshold. Localized activations were then identified using familywise error correction. Activations to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) that increased from the beginning to end (across) threat conditioning were more extensive within the GAD+ID group. Increased activations to the CS+ across extinction learning were greater within the GAD-ID than the GAD+ID group, and delayed 24h in the latter. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with decreased activations across threat conditioning, but with increased activations across extinction learning. Better sleep quality promoted greater engagement of neural substrates of extinction learning. The GAD+ID group failed to engage brain areas supporting extinction learning immediately following threat conditioning, but did so when stimuli were again presented following a delay.",

    "content": "The brain relies on external landmarks to anchor internal spatial representations. The neural mechanisms underlying this process and the sources of landmark signals remain unknown in mammals. Here, we simultaneously recorded single neurons across five parahippocampal regions in rats navigating a virtual reality environment that preserved natural locomotion. Area 29e, an understudied parahippocampal field, displayed strong locking to visual landmarks under conditions in which neurons in the other regions, such as the medial entorhinal cortex, decoupled their spatial firing from the landmarks. Compared to the other regions, area 29e neurons also displayed weaker theta modulation, stronger gamma rhythmicity, stronger egocentric head-direction tuning, and enhanced landmark contrast sensitivity. The loss of landmark anchoring in non-29e parahippocampal neurons was preceded by a decline of gamma-band influence from 29e to medial entorhinal cortex. Together, these findings position 29e as a specialized visuospatial hub that may carry landmark signals for anchoring parahippocampal representations of space to the external world.",

    "title": "Feasibility of decoding cerebellar movement-related potentials for brain-computer interface applications",
    "content": "Objective. In brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, signals are conventionally acquired from the cerebrum, and only a subset of the complex interactions that occur in several areas of the brain are collected. One area that has not been investigated for BCI application is the cerebellum, despite its involvement in movement and executive function. The present study aimed to determine the features of movement-related cerebellar electrocerebellography (ECeG) that are most useful for decoding, and how performance compares with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cerebrum. Approach. ECeG and EEG data were collected from six healthy adults to identify useful movement-related features from both cerebrum and cerebellum. Electromyography was used to capture the movements from the muscles. Decoding was conducted in binary movement vs. rest and movement vs. movement systems using support vector machines. Decoding performance was compared between cerebral, cerebellar, a combination of both, and temporal groups. Re-referencing techniques were applied to compensate for possible common reference artefacts or volume conduction effects. Main results. Movement-related features were decoded from over the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Classification accuracies were similar in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, when classifying movement vs. rest (cerebrum: 0.78 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and movement vs. movement states (cerebrum: 0.76 \u00b1 0.02, cerebellum: 0.71 \u00b1 0.02). The delta band (1\u20133 Hz) was the most useful feature for decoding. Significance. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ECeG is a feasible source of movement related signals for implementing a BCI. The present study also demonstrated that the ECeG closely resembled the EEG signals and represents an alternate approach for BCI where the signal from the cerebrum is unreliable either due to disease or injury.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ) is commonly used to assess nightmare distress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "We present Dream Hotel Room 1, a sculptural artwork by Carsten H\u00f6ller (with Adam Haar Horowitz) that uses dream engineering techniques to induce flying dreams. Dreams of flying are an exceptional experience; even years after their occurrence, people report these remain some of the most meaningful and memorable dreams of their lives. Existing literature suggests that flying dreams are common in childhood and then become infrequent in adulthood, occurring in only about 1% of adult dreams. We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

If you understand how they work but don't, why not?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Mulberry_3962\"> /u/Icy_Mulberry_3962 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oubbk3/decorators_are_great/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oubbk3/decorators_are_great/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Sex-specific regulation of social play in juvenile rats by oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus and oxytocin signaling in the nucleus accumbens",
    "content": "Social play is a rewarding behavior shown across juvenile mammalian species and is important for the development of social competency throughout the lifespan. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) regulates various social behaviors and is being used in clinical trials to improve social competency. However, the role of OXT in juvenile social play is largely unknown. To address this gap, we determined the involvement of hypothalamic OXT-producing neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), PVNOXT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and OXT signaling within the NAc, in the regulation of social play in juvenile male and female rats. We found that neither chemogenetic stimulation of SONOXT cell bodies nor PVNOXT projections to the NAc altered the expression of juvenile social play but instead increased social investigation. However, chemogenetic stimulation of PVNOXT cell bodies as well as intra-NAc infusion of OXT decreased social play in males without an effect in females. Lastly, social play duration correlated negatively with the proportion of activated NAcOXTR neurons, an effect driven by males. Together, these findings suggest that distinct OXT neuronal populations modulate different forms of social behavior and that PVNOXT neurons and NAc-OXT signaling sex-specifically modulate social play behavior.",

    "title": "Modelling Auditory Enhancement: Efferent Control of Cochlear Gain can Explain Level Dependence and Effects of Hearing Loss",
    "content": "The role of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent gain control in auditory enhancement (AE) was investigated using a subcortical auditory model. AE refers to the influence of a precursor on detectability of targets. The absence (or presence) of a precursor component at the target frequency enhances (or suppresses) detection under simultaneous masking conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced target under simultaneous masking acts as a stronger forward masker for a delayed probe tone, known as AE under forward masking. Psychoacoustic studies of AE report findings that challenge conventional expectations, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, listeners with hearing impairment have AE under simultaneous masking but not forward masking (Kreft et al., 2018; Kreft and Oxenham, 2019), whereas listeners with normal hearing have level-dependent AE under forward masking (Kreft and Oxenham, 2019). Our model with MOC efferent gain control successfully replicated these findings. In contrast, a model without efferent gain control failed to capture these effects, supporting the hypothesis that MOC-mediated cochlear gain modulation may play a role in AE and its alteration by hearing loss.",

    "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are central to action selection and reinforcement learning, yet how the topological organization of the BG circuit with dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors shape learning remains unclear. We present a topologically organized spiking model of macaque BG with cortico-striatal inputs organized into competing channels, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), three-factor DA modulated STDP for cortical synapses, asymmetric intra-striatal collaterals, and partially overlapping direct/indirect pathways. We validate resting activity and action selection, then study conditioning and generalization discrimination learning using DA bursts (CS+) and dips (CS). Two structural determinants emerged. First, pathway overlap ({lambda} ) trades off selection efficiency and learning speed: higher overlap degrades GPi-based selection efficiency during conditioning, yet accelerates convergence during discrimination by strengthening D2 influence on GPi. Second, lateral inhibition from MSN-D2 to MSNs ({kappa}) helps constrain competing actions but is not sufficient alone; robust discrimination requires DA dip dependent up modulation of D2 collateral efficacy (), which speeds and, at low overlap, enables convergence. Simulations under Parkinsonian and schizophrenia-like settings showed different deficits. A hypodopaminergic Parkinsonian STDP regime (D1 LTP loss, D2 LTD loss) impaired conditioning and failed to enhance discrimination. In contrast, attenuated D2 plasticity during DA dips (modeling methamphetamine-induced changes/schizophrenia-related dysregulation) selectively disrupted discrimination while sparing conditioning. Finally, we demonstrate efficient scaling on the Fugaku supercomputer to rodent and non human primate relevant sizes, supporting large scale, biologically grounded BG simulations. Together, the results highlight how pathway overlap and D2 collateral dynamics jointly regulate the speed and reliability of discrimination learning, and how specific DA perturbations map to distinct learning impairments.",

    "title": "Early life adversity increases striatal dopamine D1 receptor density and promotes social alcohol drinking in mice, especially males",
    "content": "The brain's reward circuitry remains sensitive to experience throughout early life and into adulthood, allowing individuals to adapt to their unique environments. Adverse experiences early in life can increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, likely through alterations to this circuitry. Yet, the precise neurobiological mechanisms by which early life adversity acts are incompletely characterized. In this study, we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm as a translationally relevant model of early life adversity in isogenic C57BL/6J mice. After LBN-rearing, we assessed the lasting behavioral and neurobiological impacts of this experience in adulthood. In robust sample sizes, our results validated previous findings of increased risk avoidance, enhanced acute response to alcohol, and greater voluntary alcohol drinking in socially-housed LBN-reared mice, especially males. Further, using autoradiography, we found LBN-reared mice had increased striatal D1-like receptor binding, skewing D1- to D2-like receptor balance relative to cross-fostered controls. However, after voluntary alcohol drinking, we found a strong downregulation in D1-like, and some D2-like, receptor binding, negating pre-existing differences in striatal dopamine receptor binding. We posit that via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, LBN-rearing upregulates striatal D1-receptor density and alters risk avoidance and acute alcohol stimulation to promote alcohol drinking among adversity-exposed mice. Together, these findings reveal specific neurobiological mechanisms that promote alcohol consumption following early life adversity and suggest complex interactions between early life adversity, sex-related factors, and dopamine receptor regulation in contributing to alcohol use disorder (AUD) vulnerability.",

    "content": "Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and APOE4 represent two of the strongest pathological and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these co-pathogens interact during preclinical stages remains undefined. To address this, we developed a humanized knock-in mouse model expressing physiological, endogenously regulated human A{beta} and APOE4. Aged AppNL-F:APOE4 mice displayed incipient amyloidosis with subtle memory-related changes, consistent with preclinical AD. We found largely distinct, non-overlapping APOE4- and A{beta}-driven effects on synaptic function, sleep architecture, and exploratory behavior. However, at the transcriptomic level, APOE4 x A{beta} had a pronounced interaction in neuronal populations, whereas glial populations were primarily affected by either genotype alone. Within neurons, APOE4 x A{beta} interactions converged on a lysosomal-ER proteostasis axis across both excitatory and inhibitory cell types. These findings suggest that APOE4 x A{beta} interaction generates an early neuronal vulnerability signature that precedes overt functional decline. The AppNL-F:APOE4 knock-in model provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying early pathogenic mechanisms in AD.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

    "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

    "content": "BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. In that context, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Furthermore, alterations in parietal memory network (PMN) integrity and default mode network (DMN) also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that might interfere with cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson\u2019s disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC or LPC separately.MethodsThis is a randomized and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS in 120 patients (60 aMCI and 60 PD-MCI). Firstly, all patients will be randomly (1:1) divided into two groups: DLPFC (30 aMCI; 30 PD-MCI) and LPC (30 aMCI, 30 PD-MCI) for tDCS stimulation. Secondly, they will classify randomly (2:1) real and sham groups for tDCS applied to once a day for 10 days over 2 weeks. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2-mA current frequency and will last 20\u202fmin. The primary outcome assessment for this study will be the change in score from baseline to the end of (14-days and 90\u202fdays follow-up) the tDCS application for the neurocognitive tests. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the neural underpinnings and pro-cognitive outcomes of tDCS.

    "content": "IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as various acupoints, on human autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and physical stress. The research further to identify effective intervention strategies for stress management and health maintenance.MethodsA Self-comparison design was conducted with healthy volunteers. Thirty-five volunteers received sequential 15-min interventions of moxibustion at ST36, acupuncture at CV12, and acupuncture at ST36, with a one-day washout period between interventions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured to assess autonomic function, and heart rate (HR) and the physical stress index (PSI) were measured to assess stress levels.ResultsCompared with the baseline, acupuncture at ST36 increased the high-frequency power (HF), root mean square of the successive interval difference (RMSSD), instantaneous standard deviation of the R\u2013R interval (SD1), long-term standard deviation of the R\u2013R intervals (SD2), total power (TP), and standard deviation of the normal\u2013normal interval (SDNN). Acupuncture at CV12 increased RMSSD, SD1, SD2, TP and SDNN, with sustained effects for RMSSD and SD1 post-acupuncture, SD1/SD2 were increased post-acupuncture. The HRs of all three interventions decreased during the intervention, and remained sustained effects post-intervention. The PSI decreased during acupuncture and the stimulation at CV12 remained sustained effects post-acupuncture.ConclusionAcupuncture alleviates physical stress by regulating ANS activity, with distinct modulatory effects observed across different acupoints, indicating potential applications in stress management and health maintenance.

    "title": "Unexpected words that become your best memories: How sentential constraint and word expectedness affect memory retrieval",
    "content": "Much is known about how the strength of contextual support from strongly constraining (SC) and weakly constraining (WC) sentences influences the online processing of expected (EXP) and unexpected (UNEXP) sentence-ending words. In the present study, we investigated the long-term mnemonic consequences associated with the processing of contextually constraint words and used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the memory retrieval mechanisms at work. Furthermore, we investigated false memories for expected but unpresented words. If these unpresented words remained highly accessible in memory, their false recognition as familiar would manifest in a larger early frontal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of episodic familiarity. Behavioral results indicated that strongly expected and highly unexpected words were more likely to be recognized, whereas memory for moderately expected words was attenuated. However, the anticipated early frontal old/new effects in these conditions did not materialize. Instead, the retrieval of highly unexpected (SC-UNEXP) words was characterized by a late parietal old/new effect, reflecting a reliance on recollection-based processes. Unexpectedly, during retrieval SC-UNEXP words also evoked a late frontal positivity, a pattern usually associated with the inhibition of unpresented expected words during encoding. This suggests that the retrieval of these words reactivated inhibitory mechanisms akin to those activated during encoding. Additionally, expected lures that were correctly identified as new elicited a broadly distributed positive slow wave, indicative of recollective processing in support of a recall-to-reject strategy. This latter effect was observed irrespective of the predictive strength of the contextual support.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "title": "Neural Entrainment in the Theta Band Predicts Groove Perception in Popular Music",
    "content": "When humans listen to popular music, they often feel 'the groove', which is a pleasurable urge to move along with music. Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brain's entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals' groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatio-temporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence. Our results support the theory that the perception of groove is rooted in the brain's ability to entrain to ongoing dynamic temporal structures of music in the theta band. They further show that multivariate decoding models can be leveraged to predict subjective groove online from neural entrainment with high accuracy and temporal resolution. Summary - While participants (n = 30) rated their subjective groove perception of 9 popular songs and 12 MIDI clapping rhythms, we measured how their brains entrained to these musical stimuli using stimulus-brain coherence (SBC) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measures. - Both stimulus types strongly entrained delta-theta (1-7 Hz) oscillations. In univariate analyses, also both stimulus types at fronto-central, beat-related frequencies significantly predicted groove ratings. - Multivariate decoding using EEG entrainment patterns predicted individual groove ratings far better (up to Pearson r = 0.8), with combined ITPC patterns providing the most information.",

    "title": "Old-New Recognition Memory Revisited",
    "content": "Identifying old items during recognition memory tasks elicits widespread cortical responses. Recent results suggest that a distributed network, labeled the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), responds to old items, potentially reflecting mnemonic familiarity. An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here, we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity. These results revise our understanding of brain networks contributing to old-new recognition separating component processes common to many forms of target detection task from processes preferentially associated with mnemonic history.",

    "title": "Cell-type-resolved NRXN1 isoforms across human brain tissues and hiPSC organoids",
    "content": "NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing that generates a highly diverse repertoire of isoforms, diversifying protein-protein interactions, shaping synaptic specialization, and contributing to neuropsychiatric disease when disrupted. However, the splicing landscape of NRXN1 across distinct human brain cell types remains poorly defined. Because NRXN1 expression level is relatively low in adult brains and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons, single-cell Iso-seq RNA sequencing often provides insufficient coverage to capture its full isoform diversity, particularly across heterogeneous cell populations. To address this gap, we developed an integrative sequencing strategy that combines single-cell transcriptomics, targeted enrichment of NRXN1 transcripts, and long-read sequencing. This approach reveals a comprehensive catalog of cell-type resolved NRXN1 isoforms across adult and fetal human postmortem brains as well as hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. From the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) region, our analyses reveal distinct splicing programs across interneuron subtypes, pyramidal neurons, and glial lineages. Comparisons between prenatal and adult brains indicate that NRXN1 isoform profiles are established during early development and remain stable throughout neuronal maturation. In hiPSC organoid models, splicing profiles partially mirror both developmental and mature brain patterns, with a subset of splice sites exhibiting cell type- and stage-specific divergence. In the cerebellum of an autism case and in organoids derived from schizophrenia patients, carrying non-recurrent heterozygous NRXN1 deletions, we identify disrupted isoform expression and mutant NRXN1alpha; isoforms and characterize their distribution across diverse cell types. These findings help understand the complex alternative splicing of NRXN1 in adult human brain and hiPSC-derived models and establish a framework for decoding cell type-specific isoform diversity for important genes with relatively low gene expression levels.",

    "title": "The Cerebellum Implements an Oscillatory Forward Model for Accurate Motor Timing",
    "content": "Voluntary movements are composed of small sub-movements generated by pulsatile bursts of muscle activity at 4-10 Hz. These motor intermittencies synchronize with rhythmic brain activity and vary with movement velocity and sensory delays, suggesting they are a signature of a central oscillatory motor control mechanism. We hypothesized that these pulsatile movements arise from a cerebellar clocking mechanism- a neuronal timing process that flexibly adjusts its dynamics to maintain motor precision under temporal uncertainty. If so, cerebellar rhythms should modulate their influence on movement depending on cue predictability. To test this, we used optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), which enables high quality, movement tolerant recordings of the brain with dense cerebellar coverage. Six participants performed an auditory paced finger flexion-extension task at approximately 1 Hz with either regular or irregular cue timing to vary predictability. All participants exhibited clear 4-10 Hz intermittencies in their kinematics, synchronized to neural activity in the cerebellum and the posterior parietal cortex. Our connectivity analysis revealed for the first time, that cerebellar activity at this frequency, predominantly reflects sensory feedback, but during regular, predictable cueing, the cerebellum shifts to exert a greater feedforward influence on movement. Moreover, cerebellar oscillations were most persistently phase-aligned with motor intermittent rhythms during accurately timed actions, an effect that was absent under irregular cueing. These findings support the idea that the cerebellum implements an oscillatory forward model for motor timing and provide novel evidence for its ability to adjusting its role in coordinating sensorimotor integration according to sensory predictability. Motor intermittencies may thus represent the output of a cerebellar timing process that underpins precise voluntary action.",

    "content": "Precision neurodiversity marks a shift in neuroscience from pathological models to personalized frameworks that view neurological differences as adaptive variations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation. The convergence of advanced neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine offers unprecedented opportunities for tailored interventions, while celebrating neurological diversity as a source of human strength.",

    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "content": "BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), associated with cognitive decline and stroke risk. An accurate predictive model is needed for early risk assessment.MethodsThis retrospective study utilized data from 587 patients undergoing cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Hebei University\u2019s Neurology Department. A predictive model for WMH was developed using a combination of clinical and laboratory parameters through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and binary logistic regression analysis. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsKey predictors included age, history of stroke, hypertension, triiodothyronine levels, albumin- globulin ratio, and homocysteine. The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI: 0.738\u20130.829) in the training cohort and 0.762 (95% CI: 0.690\u20130.834) in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA confirmed the model\u2019s clinical applicability.ConclusionThis study presents a validated nomogram for predicting WMH, integrating clinical and biochemical markers. The model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy and potential for early risk stratification. Future studies should focus on multi-center validation and expanded risk factor inclusion.",

    "title": "Are emojis better? The impact of generative AI emoji cues and service outcomes on user satisfaction: evidence from ERPs",
    "content": "To promote the sustainable development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications in the service industry, enhancing user satisfaction is key. Emojis serve as catalysts for conveying emotions and enhancing user experience in online communication. However, due to the black-box nature and unpredictability of GenAI, service providers find it challenging to control the boundaries of their application. Currently, there is ongoing debate within the academic community regarding the use of emojis in GenAI, particularly concerning emotional manipulation and experience enhancement, with further exploration needed into their effectiveness and underlying mechanisms. This study is based on the emotion as social information model and employs event-related potential (ERP) technology with high temporal resolution, which is more suitable for GenAI interaction scenarios. By measuring users\u2019 immediate cognitive processing and psychological activities, the study analyzes the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms through which emojis (presence vs. absence) and service outcomes (success vs. failure) influence user satisfaction. Behavioral results indicate that the outcome of GenAI services determines user satisfaction, while the presence or absence of emojis does not directly impact satisfaction. ERP results show that the presence of emojis compared to their absence triggers larger P3 amplitudes (emotional arousal) and N4 amplitudes (cognitive conflict); compared to service success, the presence of emojis during service failure triggers larger N4 amplitudes. This study reveals the complexity of user responses in real human-machine interaction environments, enriches research on the use of Emojis in GenAI, and provides scientific theoretical and practical foundations for GenAI design and enhancing user experience.",

    "content": "ObjectiveBiallelic variants in KCTD7 have been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset epilepsy, cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia.MethodsWhole-exome sequencing was first performed in the elder sister to identify candidate variants, followed by in silico pathogenicity prediction. Sanger sequencing was then used to validate the variants in both parents and the younger brother.ResultsWe report two siblings with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) carrying compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants: c.334C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg112Cys), a paternally inherited variant previously reported in homozygous form and currently classified as likely pathogenic, and c.640C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg214Trp), a novel maternally inherited variant currently classified as of uncertain significance. Both patients presented between 2 and 3\u202fyears of age with gait instability, myoclonic seizures, and developmental regression. EEG revealed background slowing, multifocal spike\u2013slow wave discharges, and electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Brain MRI findings were initially unremarkable despite progressive neurological deterioration. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger validation confirmed the variants and their segregation. In silico tools predicted both variants to be deleterious, and structural modeling using PyMOL and I-Mutant 3.0 demonstrated that both variants likely disrupt local residue interactions and reduce protein stability. Both patients received antiepileptic therapy and immunomodulatory treatment, including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. The proband achieved seizure control and improved gait following immunotherapy, though cognitive deficits persisted. The younger sibling exhibited a more severe disease course, with progressive cognitive decline, speech and visual impairment, and loss of independent ambulation, despite partial seizure control. These findings expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-related PME and suggest that immunotherapy may confer partial clinical benefit in selected cases.ConclusionThis case expands the variant spectrum of KCTD7-related disorders and emphasizes the utility of comprehensive genetic testing in early-onset neurodegenerative epileptic syndromes. Functional studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of the novel KCTD7 variant.",

    "content": "IntroductionCerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of stroke and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Studying monogenic forms of cSVD can elucidate molecular pathways that are dysfunctional in the common sporadic forms and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 cause highly penetrant cSVD as part of the multisystem disorder known as Gould syndrome, which includes cerebrovascular manifestations such as porencephaly, early-onset stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsTo investigate how allelic heterogeneity influences cerebrovascular phenotypes, we examined five Col4a1 mutant mouse strains that collectively model the clinical spectrum of Gould syndrome. Each strain underwent multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 14.1 Tesla to assess radiological features characteristic of cSVD.ResultsMultimodal MRI successfully identified typical cSVD-associated lesions across all Col4a1 mutant strains. The imaging revealed heterogeneous expressivity among the allelic variants in terms of lesion prevalence, size, and number. Furthermore, analysis across strains identified brain regions that were consistently more vulnerable to cSVD-related lesions.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that high-field multimodal MRI can sensitively detect and differentiate cerebrovascular abnormalities among Col4a1 mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome. The approach provides a powerful, noninvasive platform for assessing genotype\u2013phenotype relationships and for identifying brain regions at heightened risk in cSVD, supporting its potential use in early diagnosis and mechanistic studies of vascular pathology.",

    "content": "arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.",

    "title": "Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.",

We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.",

    "title": "Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.08292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this \"sweet spot\" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.08101v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.\n  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\\em vs.\\/}\\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.07960v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central \"Bayesian\" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.",

    "title": "Inferring Hidden Motives: Bayesian Models of Preference Learning in Repeated Dictator Games",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.07825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of strategic complexity. Participants observed others' allocation decisions and predicted their future behavior while playing through an exhaustive, randomized payoff space implemented on The Morality Game platform. We formalize social-preference learning as Bayesian belief updating over continuous parameters such as self-interest, altruism, envy, and guilt. The resulting Utility Bayesian Model (UBM) outperformed non-Bayesian alternatives and Bayesian models that categorize others into discrete social types. Because Bayesian updating requires a utility function in its likelihood term, we conducted the largest utility-function comparison to date--476 candidate forms differing in psychologically meaningful properties (e.g., payoff exponents, reference dependence, payoff ratios, and envy-guilt asymmetries). Exploring this joint space of payoffs and models allowed us to identify the function that unifies prior theories and generalizes across payoff conditions. Parameter estimation revealed moderate altruism, strong inequality aversion, and nonlinear payoff valuation (exponent > 1). Altruism and social-comparison motives were largely independent, revealing diverse moral phenotypes from cooperative to competitive or sadistic. Together, these findings provide a computational framework and a map of social motives, clarifying how humans learn whom to trust and offering quantitative foundations for promoting cooperation in social and artificial systems.",

    "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

    "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

    "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
    "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1\u20135) and cognitive processes (clusters 6\u20139), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.",

    "title": "Inter-brain synchrony between undergraduate students during a naturalistic online seminar predicted greater relational satisfaction and task performance",
    "content": "As higher education increasingly transitions to online platforms such as Zoom, understanding the mechanisms that underlie effective virtual collaboration has become essential. Prior research has shown that relational quality, trust, and communication strongly influence online collaborative learning; however, the real-time cognitive and affective dynamics underpinning these interactions are yet to be elucidated. This study addresses this gap by examining inter-brain synchrony (IBS)\u2014the alignment of neural activity between individuals\u2014as an indicator of collaborative success. Using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we investigated IBS in 30 dyads of undergraduate students engaged in a naturalistic three-phase Zoom seminar comprising lecture viewing, interactive discussion, and a presentation. Inter-brain synchrony between partners was computed in the prefrontal cortex, and outcomes were assessed via relational satisfaction questionnaires and standardized ratings of presentations. Results showed that IBS emerged predominantly during active discussions, but not during passive lecture viewing, underscoring the importance of interactive engagement in generating neural alignment. Crucially, higher IBS during discussion predicted both greater group relational satisfaction and improved task performance. These findings extend prior evidence that IBS supports cooperation, demonstrating that neural synchrony can occur even without physical co-presence and is associated with both performance and satisfaction in virtual educational settings.",

    "content": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in the complex pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, a leading cause of global death and disability. This review synthesizes current understanding of the core ferroptosis pathways, including iron dysregulation, glutathione depletion, and GPX4 inactivation and distinguishes it from other cell death modalities. We critically explore its role as a pathogenic amplifier in stroke, synergizing with neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction to expand neuronal injury. The review systematically assesses therapeutic strategies, from iron chelators and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (e.g., ferrostatin-1) to emerging gene therapies and nanomedicine-based approaches, based on robust preclinical evidence. However, translating these findings faces challenges, including a narrow therapeutic window, patient heterogeneity, and the need to balance efficacy with safety concerning systemic iron and lipid metabolism. To overcome these translational challenges, future research must prioritize the discovery of clinical biomarkers (e.g., FABP5) and the development of targeted delivery systems to advance ferroptosis-directed therapies for stroke.",

    "title": "Expression of dementia biomarkers in Appalachian and non-Appalachian ELVO patients during thrombectomy",
    "content": "Background/ContextVascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) affects 25-30% of stroke patients and includes cognitive impairments caused by vascular injury, such as post-stroke dementia. Rehabilitation has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients at risk of developing dementia. However, there is currently no reliable method to identify those at risk of dementia after a stroke. Several biomarkers, including ADRD (Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias) biomarkers (Ab, tau, NfL, and GFAP) and angiogenic factors (VEGF, Flt-1, Tie-2, PIGF, and FGF) have been associated with the development of dementia.Populations in Appalachia experience a higher incidence of stroke and related mortality compared to other groups. Given the elevated stroke rates in Appalachian communities, this study aims to investigate potential proteomic differences between patients from Appalachian and non-Appalachian counties. The primary goal of the study is to characterize the expression of post-stroke cognitive dementia biomarkers and to explore differences in the proteomic profiles of Appalachian and non-Appalachian populations.Methods/ApproachSample Collection: The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry Collaborative (BACTRAC) protocol, established by Fraser and colleagues, introduces a novel method for analyzing stroke by collecting intracranial blood samples from patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. During the procedure the thrombus and blood samples from areas distal and proximal to the thrombus are collected and undergo proteomic analysis (Fraser et al.). Additional demographic and clinical information are collected from electronic health records. The control data was obtained from arterial blood collected during diagnostic angiograms from patients with cerebrovascular disease.Data AnalysisPropensity score models were used to perform a one-to-one match between stroke and control patients on age, sex, BMI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia resulting in groups that were balanced on these measured prognostic characteristics. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was then used to assess differences in the 12 ADRD biomarkers.ResultsCompared to the controls, stroke patients had significantly higher levels of GFAP. The control patients had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. In the Appalachian patient population, the control patients also had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. Additionally, the Appalachian stroke patients had higher GFAP. In the non-Appalachian population only GFAP was significantly different between stroke and control groups, with it being elevated in the stroke group.ConclusionThere was a notable difference in the levels of certain ADRD biomarkers between stroke patients and control patients. Specifically, in Appalachian populations, stroke patients showed significant differences in multiple ADRD biomarkers (AB40, AB42, and GFAP) compared to controls, a pattern not seen in non-Appalachian stroke patients, where only GFAP levels increased. This difference in ADRD biomarkers observed in Appalachian stroke patients could be attributed to a combination of socioeconomic and environmental factors unique to the Appalachian region.",

    "title": "A deep hybrid CSAE-GRU framework with two-stage balancing for automatic epileptic seizure detection using EEG-derived features",
    "content": "IntroductionEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain, posing a persistent challenge in clinical diagnosis. This study presents a high-performance epileptic seizure detection framework that integrates advanced feature extraction and classification techniques using EEG signals.MethodsWe conduct experiments on the Bonn and CHB-MIT EEG datasets. The EEG signals are preprocessed through bandpass filtering and five-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition. From each sub-band, four representative features are systematically extracted. To mitigate severe class imbalance, we propose a two-stage balancing strategy: cluster centroid-based under-sampling initially reduces the interictal-to-ictal ratio to 2:1, followed by Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BLSMOTE) in the feature space. A hybrid classification model that combines Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed in the paper. The encoder weights from the pre-trained CSAE are transferred to the GRU-based classifier to enhance feature representation and model generalization.ResultsThe proposed method achieves outstanding performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1 score and AUC of 98.46, 98.27, 98.50, 98.36, 98.31, and 98.23% on the Bonn dataset, and 99.49, 99.21, 99.77, 99.49, 99.35, and 99.57% on the CHB-MIT dataset, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.DiscussionThis study introduces a novel framework combining cluster centroid-based under-sampling, BLSMOTE oversampling, and transfer learning via CSAE-GRU integration. The method offers a promising direction for reliable and clinically applicable automated epilepsy diagnosis.",

    "title": "Changes in muscle activation and joint motion during walking after transtibial amputation with sensory feedback from spinal cord stimulation: a case study",
    "content": "Objective. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activity during walking after lower-limb amputation. Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation. Approach. This case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 d. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity and knee and ankle joint angles. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early (Day 30) and late (Day 63) time points across the implant duration. Main results. During walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal. Significance. Restoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS altered muscle activity during walking led to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.",

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

We propose Human-Layer AI (HL-AI)--user-owned, explainable intermediaries that sit in the browser between platform logic and the interface. HL-AI gives people practical, moment-to-moment control without requiring platform cooperation. We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.",

While generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are increasingly used for idea generation, designers often struggle to craft effective prompts and find it difficult to express evolving visual concepts through text alone. In the formative study (N=6), we examined how designers use GenAI during ideation, revealing that text-based prompting disrupts creative flow. To address these issues, we developed TalkSketch, an embedded multimodal AI sketching system that integrates freehand drawing with real-time speech input. TalkSketch aims to support a more fluid ideation process through capturing verbal descriptions during sketching and generating context-aware AI responses. Our work highlights the potential of GenAI tools to engage the design process itself rather than focusing on output.",

Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05744v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conditionally automated driving requires drivers to resume vehicle control promptly when automation reaches its operational limits. Ensuring smooth vehicle control transitions is critical for the safety and efficiency of mixed-traffic transportation systems, where complex interactions and variable traffic behaviors pose additional challenges. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an adaptive time budget framework that provides drivers with sufficient time to complete takeovers both safely and comfortably across diverse scenarios. We focus in particular on the takeover buffer, that is, the extra time available after drivers consciously resume control to complete evasive maneuvers. A driving simulator experiment is conducted to evaluate the influence of different takeover buffer lengths on safety-related indicators (minimum time-to-collision, maximum deceleration, and steering wheel angle) and subjective assessments (perceived time sufficiency, perceived risk, and performance satisfaction). Results show that (i) takeover buffers of about 5-6 seconds consistently lead to optimal safety and comfort; and (ii) drivers prefer relatively stable takeover buffers across varying traffic densities and n-back tasks. This study introduces an adaptive time budget framework that dynamically allocates transition time by incorporating a predicted takeover time and a preferred takeover buffer (piecewise function). This can serve as an important first step toward providing drivers with sufficient time to resume vehicle control across diverse scenarios, which needs to be validated in more diverse and real-world driving contexts. By aligning the provided time budget with driver needs under specific circumstances, the adaptive framework can improve reliability of control transitions, facilitate human-centered automated driving, reduce crash risk, and maintain overall traffic efficiency.",

It focuses on two primary questions: (1) How strongly is exposure to cultural, educational, and digital resources associated with creativity? (2) Do students perform better on divergent thinking tasks when physically engaged or digitally stimulated? Drawing on a sample of 15,425 students from 60 countries, the study applies high-dimensional regression and factor analysis to identify patterns across a wide range of exposure variables. To model the latent structure of home environment variables, we conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The analysis specified two latent factors: Physical Exposure and Digital Exposure. The model demonstrated excellent fit, with a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.971 and a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.038. When both factors were entered together in the regression, physical and digital exposures each contributed unique explanatory power. There is no indication that one simply proxies the other; rather, they appear to be complementary dimensions of a creative home environment. This study offers compelling international evidence that both physical and digital resources in the home environment play significant, independent, and complementary roles in shaping adolescent creative thinking abilities. These findings have direct implications for efforts to promote creativity and equity in education.",

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities to enhance the advising process. We present AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system that automates time-consuming tasks, such as information retrieval and response drafting, while preserving human oversight. AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility. Our evaluation shows that AdvisingWise produces accurate, personalized responses. Advisors reported increasingly positive perceptions after using AdvisingWise, as their initial concerns about reliability and personalization diminished. We conclude by discussing the implications of human-AI synergy on the practice of academic advising.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05699v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how humans attribute beliefs, goals, and intentions to others, known as theory of mind (ToM), is critical in the context of human-computer interaction. Despite various metrics used to assess ToM, the interplay between cognitive, spatial, and emotional factors in influencing human decision making during adversarial interactions remains underexplored. This paper investigates these relationships using the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game as a testbed. Through established ToM tests, we analyze how cognitive reasoning, spatial awareness, and emotional perceptiveness affect human performance when interacting with bots and human opponents in repeated RPS settings. Our findings reveal significant correlations among certain ToM metrics and highlight humans' ability to detect patterns in opponents' actions. However, most individual ToM metrics proved insufficient for predicting performance variations, with recursive thinking being the only metric moderately associated with decision effectiveness. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), we identified two latent factors influencing decision effectiveness: Factor 1, characterized by recursive thinking, emotional perceptiveness, and spatial reasoning, positively affects decision-making against dynamic bots and human players, while Factor 2, linked to interpersonal skills and rational ability, has a negative impact. These insights lay the groundwork for further research on ToM metrics and for designing more intuitive, adaptive systems that better anticipate and adapt to human behavior, ultimately enhancing human-machine collaboration.",

However, most existing Discord bots lack specialized educational functionalities and mobile-friendly interfaces, limiting their effectiveness for instructional use. This paper presents InsightEdu, an innovative iOS application that provides a touch-centric interface for managing a custom Discord bot designed for educational contexts. The system enables educators to conduct surveys, collect feedback, and track attendance through an intuitive mobile interface. The architecture combines a SwiftUI-based iOS client application with a Python-based Discord bot server. User evaluation with educators demonstrated significant usability improvements compared to traditional Discord interfaces, with 92% of participants (n = 20) reporting enhanced efficiency in managing educational interactions.

ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social interaction) is an encountered-type haptic display that integrates a torque-controlled manipulator and interchangeable props with a VR headset to enable three gestures: object handovers, fist bumps, and high fives. We conducted a user study to examine how ETHOS adds physicality to virtual character interactions and how this affects presence, realism, enjoyment, and connection metrics. Each participant experienced one interaction under three conditions: no physicality (NP), static physicality (SP), and dynamic physicality (DP). SP extended the purely virtual baseline (NP) by introducing tangible props for direct contact, while DP further incorporated motion and impact forces to emulate natural touch. Results show presence increased stepwise from NP to SP to DP. Realism, enjoyment, and connection also improved with added physicality, though differences between SP and DP were not significant. Comfort remained consistent across conditions, indicating no added psychological friction. These findings demonstrate the experiential value of ETHOS and motivate the integration of encountered-type haptics into socially meaningful VR experiences.",

    "content": "<p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>",

We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<sub>2P</sub> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>",

    "title": "Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed Fibril-Induced Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation Model",
    "content": "<p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that readily establishes reward memories contributing to METH relapse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Computer programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet little is known about how the human brain enables this recently invented cultural skill. According to the neural recycling hypothesis, cultural skills (e.g., reading, math) repurpose preexisting neural \"information maps.\" Alternatively, such maps could emerge de novo during learning, as they do in artificial neural networks. Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get \"recycled\"? College students (<i>n</i> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction. Programming recycles preexisting representations of logical algorithms in frontoparietal cortices, supporting the recycling framework of cultural skill acquisition.</p>",

    "title": "Reduction in Reward-Driven Behavior Depends on the Basolateral But Not Central Nucleus of the Amygdala in Female Rats",
    "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior depends on a dynamic balance between acquisition and extinction memories. Male and female rodents differ in extinction learning rates, suggesting potential sex-based differences in this balance. In males, deletion of extinction-recruited neurons in the central nucleus (CN) of the amygdala impairs extinction retrieval, shifting behavior toward acquisition (Lay et al., 2023). Here, we tested whether this mechanism also operates in females. In contrast to previously reported findings in males, deleting extinction-recruited CN neurons after single or extended extinction training had no effect on extinction retrieval in female rats. This lack of behavioral impact was not due to sex differences in CN activation during extinction. However, during early extinction, females showed greater activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) than males. Deletion of this BLA ensemble produced a more substantial reduction in conditioned approach than in non-deletion controls. These findings uncover a potential interplay between the CN and BLA in regulating conditioned approach in females. While ablation of extinction-recruited CN neurons do not modulate extinction retrieval in females, targeted BLA neuronal ablation during early extinction shifts behavior toward low, extinction-level responding. Thus heightened BLA activation during early extinction may prevent the emergence of extinction-like behavior in females. These findings, taken together with those reported by Lay et al. (2023), offer new insights into potential sex-based differences in the neural mechanisms underlying extinction and may inform the development of sex-based treatments for cue-triggered appetitive behaviors.</p>",

Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance.

The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks.

    "content": "IntroductionElectroencephalography (EEG) can provide objective neural marker for assessing the level of consciousness of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), but current research mainly focuses on the EEG features of a single modality, such as the resting-state or the evoked state, which results in less than ideal assessment accuracy. To accurately assess the level of consciousness of DoC patients, we proposed a new method by combine with resting-state and auditory-evoked EEG.MethodsThe EEG data of resting-state and auditory-evoked potential were collected from 157 DoC patients. Then, nonlinear dynamics feature (NDF) include spatiotemporal correlation entropy and neuromodulation intensity of multimodal EEG were extracted. Next, the multi-form feature selection algorithm (MFFS) was adopted to optimize the extracted EEG features. Finally, a diagnosis model was constructed using support vector machine (SVM).ResultsAmong them, SC-Theta, SC-Alpha, NI-Alpha and ERP features were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the patient\u2019s level of consciousness, resulting in an average grouping accuracy of 92.4%.DiscussionThe proposed diagnostic model has demonstrated its distinctive advantages, showcasing remarkable effectiveness and reliability in accurately assessing consciousness states. This method holds promise for improving the reliability of clinical awareness assessments.",

    "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its scalable architecture and model integration capabilities support a range of applications in biomarker discovery, epilepsy diagnostics, and clinical decision support, bridging advanced computation and practical usability.",

    "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
    "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

    "title": "Spec2VolCAMU-Net: a spectrogram-to-volume model for EEG-to-fMRI reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net",
    "content": "Objective. High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain convolutional neural networks that fail to capture cross-channel time\u2013frequency cues or on heavy transformer/generative adversarial network decoders that strain memory and stability. Approach. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time\u2013Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modeling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Main results. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. Significance. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

    "title": "Real-time distance monitoring in magnetomyography",
    "content": "Objective. Magnetomyography (MMG) using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) offers a contactless, non-invasive approach to assess muscle activity. However, fluctuations in the sensor-to-source distance during MMG recordings pose a significant challenge to accurate signal interpretation since amplitude decays with distance. No established method exists for MMG to continuously monitor sensor-to-source distance changes in real-time. Approach. This study presents a new non-magnetic, cost-effective solution using a digital fiber optic sensor to continuously measure the distance between an OPM and the subject\u2019s skin. Following sensor calibration, distance measurements were recorded during an isometric muscle fatigue task in five healthy participants to assess whether MMG amplitude changes were due to physiological effects or variations in sensor-to-source distance. Alongside OPM-MMG and distance tracking, electromyography (EMG), the neurophysiological gold standard, was simultaneously recorded. Main results. We found significant changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue that were not merely explained by changes in sensor-to-source distance. Furthermore, we found substantial correlations between OPM-MMG and EMG that were strongest for small sensor-to-source distance (r = 0.91). Significance. Fiber optic sensors offer non-magnetic, precise, real-time monitoring of the distance between the OPM and the skin, making it ideal for MMG applications to account for distance-related variability during measurements. Our results suggest that changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue reflect genuine physiological effects rather than distance confounds.",

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

We used machine learning to analyze thematic differences between unemployed individuals and a control group. The results revealed that the dreams of unemployed individuals demonstrated an underrepresentation of surprise and visual observations alongside an overrepresentation of work-related topics. These patterns suggest that unemployment is associated with distinct alterations in dream content, reflecting reduced cognitive engagement and heightened preoccupation with occupational concerns.

    "title": "From falling apart to disturbing dreams: A preliminary examination of self-fragmentation and nightmares.",
    "content": "Previous theory suggested a relationship between fragmentation of the self-structure and nightmares. This article examines this possibility by providing an overview of the theoretical rationale for their relationship and a preliminary empirical study exploring the relationships between a brief measure of fragmentation proneness, distress, and nightmares among 307 undergraduate students. The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares. The results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "Towards Ecologically Valid LLM Benchmarks: Understanding and Designing Domain-Centered Evaluations for Journalism Practitioners",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.05501v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Benchmarks play a significant role in how researchers and the public understand generative AI systems. However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals. Our workshop findings surface specific challenges that inform benchmark design opportunities, which we instantiate in a case study that addresses underlying criticisms and specific domain concerns. Through our findings and design case study, this work provides design guidance for developing benchmarks that are better tuned to specific domains.",

    "title": "AI-Enhanced High-Density NIRS Patch for Real-Time Brain Layer Oxygenation Monitoring in Neurological Emergencies",
    "content": "arXiv:2511.05612v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05580v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.",

By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05542v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05536v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.",

The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.",

Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\\tau \\subsetneq \\sigma$ for which $|\\tau| = i$ and $|\\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.05505v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.",

The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",
