    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

    "title": "Influence of electrode placement on the recognition of different gesture categories using high-density sEMG",
    "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Learning discrete neural latent spaces for high-performance speech decoding",
    "content": "Objective. Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which directly transform neural signals into intelligible voices, offer a promising avenue for people with aphasia. To decode speech information from brain signals, neural representation learning plays an important role. Approach. Existing studies mainly explored continuous neural latent spaces for speech decoding and ignored the intrinsic discrete property in speech production. Here, we propose to learn a discrete neural latent space by constructing a quantized representation learning network for speech decoding. Main results. Experiments with intracranial stereotactic electroencephalography signals from 11 subjects demonstrated that our approach significantly improved the precision and robustness of speech decoding. Significance. These results underscore the potential of our method to improve the functionality and usability of speech BCIs for people with aphasia.",

    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients with disabilities control external devices directly without peripheral pathways. Due to the limitations in EEG signal quality, the performance of EEG-based BCIs may not be satisfactory. Shared control has become an important research direction in the field of brain-controlled wheelchairs (BCWs). However, most existing studies do not achieve the flexible movement of BCW in environments with narrow spaces. This study proposes a shared controller based on the potential field method to integrate environmental information and user commands intelligently. Approach. Considering the flexibility of wheelchair movement, we incorporated EEG decoding results obtained through the motor imagery paradigm and fused them with environmental information to create a fusion field. We then used these components separately to construct the BCI and obstacle fields. Twelve subjects participated in the virtual wheelchair navigation experiment, while five subjects took part in the real-world wheelchair navigation experiment, aiming to evaluate the control performance in different scenarios under three control modes (keyboard, BCI-only, and shared control). Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed shared controller: 1) significantly enhances navigation performance in both general and narrow environments compared with BCI-only control; 2) improves the total success rate from 8.33% to 83.33% in virtual complex environments and from 23.33% to 66.67% in real-world two-way navigation; 3) achieves success rates that are statistically comparable to keyboard control (p > 0.05). Moreover, the shared control reduced the average navigation time by nearly 100 s compared with BCI-only control in real-world experiments. Significance. This new shared control method improves the ability of BCWs to move flexibly in challenging, narrow environments.",

    "title": "High-level locomotion intent estimation from electromyography and body posture",
    "content": "Objective. Once we learn a reliable gait, we no longer have to consciously contract individual muscles to walk, or think about the fine-grained low-level control of our joints. Instead, we mainly make decisions on where we want to end up, at what pace and through which path. Estimating this high-level (HL) intent may provide the necessary input to wearable robotic devices to adapt to their user\u2019s needs. We introduce a continuous representation of locomotion goals and investigate how it may be estimated from muscle signals and body posture. Approach. This study investigated methods to estimate a representation of HL locomotion intent, the horizontal walking path. We collected full-body motion capture and bipolar surface electromyography data from 6 subjects during non-steady-state gait. We trained temporal convolutional networks to causally predict the walking path directly or parametrically with a critically damped trajectory model, using a mixture of muscle and body posture signals. Main results. We achieved a mean trajectory estimation accuracy for a 1-second walking path corresponding to using a multimodal model. We simultaneously provided estimates for current and desired walking velocities as constrained by the walking path model, aiding interpretability of the estimator\u2019s output. Significance. Our approach could provide user interfacing in a subject-independent format for wearable robotic devices. Moreover, this HL intent representation is flexible and able to be synthesized in virtual environments, where it can serve as a surrogate for biosignals of simulated intent-driven robotics.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

    "title": "\u03b2-catenin-independent regulation by TCF7L2 underlies isoform redundancy during embryonic thalamic development",
    "content": "Alternative isoforms of transcription factors are common during brain development, but their functional significance remains poorly defined. One example is TCF7L2, a transcription factor critical for developing the thalamus and autism spectrum-associated gene. It exists in two isoforms from different promoters: the long isoform (L-TCF7L2) with the {beta}-catenin-binding domain, and the shorter isoform (S-TCF7L2), lacking this domain and classically considered a dominant-negative regulator of the L isoform. Here, we investigated the role of TCF7L2 isoforms in thalamic development using total and isoform-specific knockout strategies. Analysis of axonal phenotypes, regional markers, and RNA-seq uncovered that the isoforms are functionally redundant during development. Immunohistochemistry and ChIP-seq showed that in the embryonic thalamus -- unlike in the postnatal thalamus -- TCF7L2 regulates gene expression independently of {beta}-catenin. These findings reveal a switch from {beta}-catenin-independent and isoform-redundant to classical {beta}-catenin-dependent TCF7L2 activity, occurring between the embryonic and postnatal stages. This suggests that alternative promoter usage may, in some contexts, ensure robust availability of the regulatory protein during brain development.",

As preregistration is a new practice, it is not surprising that it is not always implemented well. One challenge is that researchers do not always indicate where they deviated from their preregistration when reporting results from preregistered studies <span class=\"citation\">(<a href=\"#ref-vandenakker_potential_2024\">Akker et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Reviewers could check whether researchers adhere to the preregistration, but this requires some effort. Automation can provide a partial solution be making information more easily available, and perhaps even performing automated checks of some parts of the preregistration.</p>\n<p>Here we demonstrate how <a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>, our software to perform automated checks on scientific manuscripts, can automatically retrieve the content of a preregistration. The preregistration can then be presented alongside the relevant information in the manuscript. This makes it easier for peer reviewers to compare the information.</p>\n<p>We focus on AsPredicted preregistrations as their structured format makes it especially easy to retrieve information (but we also have code to do the same for structured OSF preregistration templates). We can easily search for AsPredicted links in all 250 open access papers from psychological science. The Papercheck package conveniently includes these in xml format in the <code>psychsci</code> object.</p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"find-aspredicted-links\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Find AsPredicted Links</h2>\n<p>Extracting links is a bit trickier than just searching for \u201caspredicted.org\u201d, so we provide a convenient function for extracting them from papers: <code>aspredicted_links()</code>. It cleans up the links when they are incorrectly formatted, such as splitting \u201chttps://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=nq4xa3\u201d across two sentences at the question mark, which is common in scientific PDFs.</p>\n<p>This function returns a table with a row for each link found that indicates the location of the link in each paper.

Novel object task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of novel items (baseline, person, stationary object, moving object). For each item, we will measure lemurs\u2019 latency to approach and their interest in each item.\\r\\n2. Quantity discrimination task. Lemurs will make choices between smaller and larger pieces of food. We will measure choices for the larger piece.\\r\\n3. Persistence task. Lemurs will be presented with a piece of food in a box that is impossible to access. We will measure how many times and for how long subjects interact with the box.\\r\\n4. Temporal discounting task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of choices between a smaller piece of food immediately available and a larger piece of the same food available after a delay. We will measure their choices for the larger delayed option.\\r\\n5. A-not-B error task. Lemurs will be first familiarized with finding food at a container in one location (A), and then in the test trial visibly see the food moved from A to a new container (B). We will measure lemurs\u2019 choices for the correct location (B).\\r\\n6. Working memory task. Lemurs will see the experimenter hide food under one of 3 identical containers; after a 5s delay with occlusion, lemurs can choose one of the cups. We will measure their choices for the correct location.\\r\\n7. Reversal learning task. Lemurs will be presented with two containers (different colors and locations). They will first learn that one container provides a food reward (whereas the other is always empty). Once they learn this, the reward contingencies will be switched in the test trials. We will measure responses for the correct option in the learning and test trials.&quot;</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb4-13\"><a href=\"#cb4-13\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\">#&gt; AP_conditions    &quot;This study does not have conditions: all individuals will complete the same tasks in the same order to assess species-level and individual-level variation in these cognitive abilities.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></span>\n<span id=\"cb4-14\"><a href=\"#cb4-14\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\">#&gt; AP_analyses      &quot;First, we will examine whether differences in species\u2019 socio-ecology predict variation in subjects\u2019 performance in a battery of cognitive tests that tap into several component executive functions. To do this, we will use generalized linear mixed models to analyze species\u2019 performance in each separate task. For each task, the dependent variable will be correct choices in that task, and the test predictor will be species. We will include subject ID as a random factor, and control for age, sex and trial number in models as relevant. Across analyses, we will compare the fit of different models using likelihood-ratio tests. In addition, we will also examine each individual\u2019s performance across the cognitive tasks, to examine whether performance on a given cognitive task predicts performance in other tasks. To do so we will first use pairwise bivariate correlations across all individuals as well as partitioning by species.

This is not necessarily problematic, as a difference might be only a single datapoint. Nevertheless, researchers should discuss the deviation, and evaluate whether the deviation impacts the severity of the test <span class=\"citation\">(<a href=\"#ref-lakens_when_2024\">Lakens 2024</a>)</span>.</p>\n<p>Checking the sample size of a study against the preregistration is some effort, as the preregistration document needs to be opened, the correct entry located, and the corresponding text in the manuscript needs to be identified. Recently, a fully automatic comparison tool, (<a href=\"https://regcheck.app/\">RegCheck</a>) has been created by Jamie Cummins from the University of Bern, that relies on large language models and AI where users upload the manuscript, the preregistration, and receive an automated comparison. We take a slightly different approach. We retrieve the preregistration from AsPredicted automatically, and present users with the information about the preregistered sample size (which is straightforward given the structured approach of the AsPredicted template). We then recommend users to compare this information against the method section in the manuscript.</p>\n<section class=\"level3\" id=\"preregistration-sample-size-plan\">\n<h3 class=\"anchored\">Preregistration Sample Size Plan</h3>\n<p>You can access the sample size plan from the results of <code>aspredicted_retrieve()</code> under the column name <code>AP_sample_size</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb5\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb5-1\"><a href=\"#cb5-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># get the sample size section from AsPredicted</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-2\"><a href=\"#cb5-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>prereg_sample_size <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">unique</span>(prereg<span class=\"sc\">$</span>AP_sample_size)</span>\n<span id=\"cb5-3\"><a href=\"#cb5-3\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-4\"><a href=\"#cb5-4\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># use cat(&quot;&gt; &quot;, x = _) with #| results: 'asis' in the code chunk</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-5\"><a href=\"#cb5-5\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><span class=\"co\"># to print out results with markdown quotes</span></span>\n<span id=\"cb5-6\"><a href=\"#cb5-6\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>prereg_sample_size <span class=\"sc\">|&gt;</span> <span class=\"fu\">cat</span>(<span class=\"st\">&quot;&gt; &quot;</span>, <span class=\"at\">x =</span> _)</span></code><button class=\"code-copy-button\" title=\"Copy to Clipboard\"><i class=\"bi\"></i></button></pre></div>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The study will compare four lemur species: ruffed lemur, Coquerel\u2019s sifakas, ring-tailed lemur and mongoose lemur at the Duke Lemur Center.

We assessed four taxonomic groups: ruffed lemurs (Varecia species, n = 10), Coquerel\u2019s sifakas (Propithecus coquereli, n = 10), ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta, n = 10), and mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz, n = 9). Ruffed lemurs consisted of both red-ruffed and black-and-white-ruffed lemurs, but we collapsed analyses across both groups given their socioecological similarity and classification as subspecies until recently (Mittermeier et al., 2008). Our sample included all the individuals available for testing who completed the battery; two additional subjects (one sifaka and one mongoose lemur) initiated the battery but failed to reach the predetermined criterion for inclusion in several tasks or stopped participating over several days. All tests were voluntary: Lemurs were never deprived of food, had ad libitum access to water, and could stop participating at any time. The lemurs had little or no prior experience in relevant cognitive tasks such as those used here (see Table S1). All behavioral tests were approved by Duke University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The authors planned to test 10 mongoose lemurs, but one didn\u2019t feel like participating. This can happen, and it does not really impact the severity of the test, but the statistical power is slightly lower than desired, and it is a deviation form the original plan - both deserve to be discussed. This papercheck module can remind researchers they deviated from a preregistration, and discuss their deviation, or it can help peer reviewers to notice a deviation is not discussed.</p>\n<div

Papercheck\u2019s philosophy is that users should evaluate the information from automated checks, and that AI should be optional and never the default, it can be efficient to send the preregistered sample size and the text reported in the manuscript to a large language model, and compare the preregistration with the text in the method section. This is more costly (both financially and ecologically) but it can work better, as the researchers might not use words like \u2018sample\u2019 or \u2018participants\u2019 and a LLM provides more flexibility to match text across two documents.</p>\n<p>Papercheck makes it easy to extract the method section in a paper:</p>\n<div class=\"cell\">\n<div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb7\"><pre class=\"sourceCode r code-with-copy\"><code class=\"sourceCode r\"><span id=\"cb7-1\"><a href=\"#cb7-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></span>\n<span id=\"cb7-2\"><a href=\"#cb7-2\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a>method_section <span class=\"ot\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"fu\">search_text</span>(paper, <span class=\"at\">pattern =</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;*&quot;</span>, <span class=\"at\">section =</span> <span class=\"fu\">c</span>(<span class=\"st\">&quot;method&quot;</span>), <span class=\"at\">return =</span> <span class=\"st\">&quot;section&quot;</span>)</span></code><button class=\"code-copy-button\" title=\"Copy to Clipboard\"><i class=\"bi\"></i></button></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>We can send the method section to an LLM, and ask which paragraph is most closely related to the text in the preregistration. Papercheck has a custom function to send text and a query to Groq. We use Groq because of its <a href=\"https://groq.com/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a>, as it will not retain data or train on data, which is important when sending text from scientific manuscripts that may be unpublished to a LLM.

The preregistered plan stated that they would test a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 individuals for each species. However, according to the text, they tested 10 ruffed lemurs, 10 Coquerel\u2019s sifakas, 10 ring-tailed lemurs, and 9 mongoose lemurs. The number of mongoose lemurs (9) is below the minimum of 10 individuals planned for each species, indicating a deviation from the preregistered plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we see, the LLM does a very good job evaluating whether the authors adhered to their preregistration in terms of the sample size. The long-run performance of this automated evaluation needs to be validated in future research - this is just a proof of principle - but it has potential for editors who want to automatically check if authors followed their preregistration, and for meta-scientists who want to examine preregistration adherence across a large number of papers. <strong>For such meta-scientific use-cases, however, the code needs to be extensively validated and error rates should be acceptably low (i.e., comparable to human coders).</strong></p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"automated-checks-can-be-wrong\">\n<h2 class=\"anchored\">Automated Checks Can Be Wrong!</h2>\n<p>The use of AI to interpret deviations is convenient, but it can\u2019t replace human judgment. The following article, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621991548\">Exploring the Facets of Emotional Episodic Memory: Remembering \u201cWhat,\u201d \u201cWhen,\u201d and \u201cWhich\u201d</a> also has a preregistration. A large language model will incorrectly state that the authors deviated from their preregistration. It misses that the authors explicitly say that Cohort B was not preregistered, and therefore, falling short of the planned sample size of 60 in that cohort should not be seen as a deviation from the preregistration. All flagged deviations from a preregistration should be manually checked. Papercheck is only intended to make checks of a preregistration more efficient, but in the end, people need to make the final judgment.

Other components of a preregistration, such as exclusions criteria, or the planned analysis, are also important to check. It might be more difficult to create automated checks for these components, given the great flexibility in how especially statistical analyses are reported. In an earlier paper we have discussed the benefits of create machine readable hypothesis tests, and we have argued that this should be considered the gold standard for a preregistration <span class=\"citation\">(<a href=\"#ref-lakens2021\">Lakens and DeBruine 2021</a>)</span>. Machine readable hypothesis tests would allow researchers to automatically check if <a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/scienceverse/articles/demo.html\">preregistered analyses are corroborated or falsified</a>. But we realize it will be some years before this becomes common practice.</p>\n<p>There are a range of other improvements and extensions that should be developed, such as support for multi-study papers that contain multiple preregistrations, and extending this code to preregistrations on other platforms, such as the OSF.

    "content": "<p>Are meta-scientists\nignoring philosophy of science (PoS)? Are they re-inventing the wheel? <a href=\"https://nomadit.co.uk/conference/metascience2025/p/17038\">A recent panel\nat the Metascience conference</a> engaged with this question, and the first\nsentence of the abstract states \u201cCritics argue that metascience merely\nreinvents the wheel of other academic fields.\u201d It\u2019s a topic I have been\nthinking about for a while, so I will share my thoughts on this question. In\nthis blog post I will only speak for myself, and not for any other metascientists. I studied philosophy for a year, read\nquite a lot about philosophy of science, regularly review for philosophy\njournals, have <a href=\"https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/event/perspectives-on-scientific-error/\" target=\"_blank\">co-organized a conference</a> that brings together philosophers and metascientists (and am <a href=\"https://perspectivesonscientificerror2026.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">co-organizing the next meeting</a>) and I currently have 3 ongoing collaborations with philosophers of\nscience. I would say it seems a bit far-fetched to claim I would be ignoring\nphilosophy of science, and just reinvent what that field has already done. But\nI am ignoring a lot of it. That is not something PoS should take personally. I\nam also ignoring a lot of metascientific work that is done. That seems\nperfectly normal to me \u2013 there is only so much work I need to engage with to do\nmy work better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I read a\nlot of the work philosophers of science have written that is relevant for\nmetascientists, and a lot they are currently writing. Too often, I find work in\nphilosophy of science on the replication crisis and related topics to be of quite\nlow quality, and mostly it turns out to be rather irrelevant for my work. It is\nvery common that philosophers seem to have thought about topics very little, and\nthe limited time they thought about a topic has been spent without any engagement\nwith actual scientists. This is especially true about the philosophical work on\nthe replication crisis. Having lived through it, and having thought about it\nevery day for the last 15 years, most of the work by philosophers is quite\nsuperficial. If you spent only 3 years fulltime on your paper (and I know\npeople who spent no more than a year full-time on an entire book!), it is just\nnot going to be insightful enough for me to learn anything I didn\u2019t know. Instead,\nI will notice a lot of mistakes, faulty assumptions, and incorrect conclusions.\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I recently\nread a book from a philosopher of science I was looking forward to, hoping I\nwould learn new things. Instead, I just thought \u2018but psychologists themselves\nhave done so much work on this that you are not discussing!\u2019 for 200 pages. I found\nthat quite frustrating. Maybe we should also talk about philosophers ignoring\nthe work by psychologists. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As I was\nbeing frustrated, a thought popped up. There are very few philosophers of\nscience, compared to the number of psychologists. Let\u2019s say I read the literature\non metascientific topics in psychology and philosophy, and only the top X% of\npapers make my work better. What is the probability that a psychologist has\nperformed work that is relevant for me as a metascientist, compared to work by\na philosopher? Because there are so many more psychologists than philosophers,\nall else equal, there will be many more important papers by psychologists than\nby philosophers that I should read. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\nall else is not equal. Psychologists have thought about all their crises for\nmore than 60 years, ever since the first crisis in the 70\u2019s </span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;FepIi8Kn&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Lakens,\n2025a, 2025b)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Lakens, 2025a, 2025b)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:22538,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/EQQKHQS9&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:22538,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Twice\nin the history of social psychology has there been a crisis of confidence. The\nfirst started in the 1960s and lasted until the end of the 1970s, and the\nsecond crisis dominated the 2010s. Drawing on extensive quotes from articles\npublished during both crises, I examine the similarities and differences\nbetween these psychological crises. In this first of two articles, I focus on\nhow researchers discussed fundamental concerns about the replicability of\nfindings across the two crises. I reflect on five possible reasons why concerns\nabout failed replications received more attention during the second crisis, the\ncontinuing lack of incentives to perform replication studies, and the\nimportance of large-scale research projects to instigate\nchange.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;International Review of Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.5334/irsp.1036&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2397-8570&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;rips-irsp.com&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Concerns\nAbout Replicability Across Two Crises in Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.1036&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;38&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,15]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,12]]},&quot;citation-key&quot;:&quot;lakens_concerns_2025a&quot;}},{&quot;id&quot;:22540,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/VAJGUKCZ&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:22540,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;During\ntwo crises in social psychology, the first from the 1960s to the end of the\n1970s, and the second starting in 2010 and still ongoing, researchers discussed\nthe strength of theories in the field, the societal relevance of research, the\ngeneralizability of effects, and problematic methodological and statistical\npractices. Continuing on the first part of this review, which focused on\nreplicability, I compare similarities in the concerns raised across both\ncrises. I consider which issues have prompted meaningful reforms and which have\nyet to result in significant progress. Finally, I reflect on the extent that\nthe incentives contributed to these crises and argue that a more coordinated\napproach to scientific research is needed to prevent these concerns from\nresurfacing in a future third\ncrisis.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;International Review of Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.5334/irsp.1038&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2397-8570&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;rips-irsp.com&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Concerns\nAbout Theorizing, Relevance, Generalizability, and Methodology Across Two\nCrises in Social\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.1038&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;38&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,15]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2025&quot;,5,12]]},&quot;citation-key&quot;:&quot;lakens_concerns_2025&quot;}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"NL\">(Lakens, 2025a, 2025b)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. Psychologists have a much better\nunderstanding of how psychological research is done than philosophers. Philosophers\nare on average smarter than psychologists (but again, there are many more psychologists), and have better training in\nconceptual analysis. Psychologists are more motivated to work on challenges in\ntheir field than philosophers. There are many other differences. So, we need to\nweigh all these factors in our model that will predict how many papers by\nphilosophers of science I find useful to read, compared to the number of papers\nby psychologists I find useful to read. I don\u2019t have those weights, but I have\nthe outcome of the model for my own research: Most often, papers by\npsychologists on metascience are better and more relevant for my work. Remember: I still ignore a lot of the papers on metascience by psychologists, and I find a lot of those\npapers low quality as well! But psychologists write a lot more on the topic,\nand I also think the best papers on metascience when I combine both fields are\nmore often written by psychologists. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I think\nthis alternative explanation for why we engage very little with philosophers of\nscience is worth taking into account. I personally consider it a strong\ncontender to explain the behavior of metascientists to an explanation that\nposits that we intentionally do not engage with the literature in philosophy of\nscience. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There are\nadditional reasons for why I end up reading less work by philosophers of\nscience. One is that I often do not agree with certain assumptions they have.\nThe ideas that guide my work have been out of fashion in philosophy of science\nfor half a century. Most of the ideas that are in fashion turn me off. I just\ndo not enjoy reading papers that say \u2018Let\u2019s assume scientists are rational\nBayesian updaters\u2019 or \u2018There is not one way to do science\u2019. My working model of\nscience is something very different, best summarized by this cartoon: </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"NL\"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype\n id=\"_x0000_t75\"

ignore most of the work by philosophers of science on metascience, I still\nengage with quite a lot of philosophy of science. If you browse through the <a href=\"https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/references.html\">reference\nlist</a> of my online textbook \u2013 which is about statistics! \u2013 I am confident\nthat there are more philosophers cited than the number of metascientists cited in a book by a philosopher of science. If you browse through the reading\nnotes of the podcast \u2018<a href=\"https://nulliusinverba.podbean.com/\">Nullius in\nVerba</a>\u2019 that I record with Smriti Mehta, I am confident that there are more\npapers by philosophers than there are papers by metascientists in podcasts by\nphilosophers of science. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I just\nwanted to share these thoughts to provide some more diversity to the ideas\nthat were shared in the panel at the Metascience conference. When \u201cthis panel\nasks what is new about metascience, and why it may have captured greater\nattention than previous research and reform initiatives\u201d maybe one reason is\nthat on average this literature is better and more relevant for researchers\ninterested in how science works, and how it could work. I know that is not going to be a very popular viewpoint for philosophers to read, but it is my viewpoint, and I think no one can criticize me for not engaging with philosophy of science enough. I have at least a moderately informed opinion on this matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">P.S.

    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

In\naddition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions,\nand identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our\nreport by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study\ndemonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection\nstrategies in practice.

Methodologists have proposed a variety\nof statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is\nnot clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests.

The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Scrutiny is important, but we can\u2019t know how extensively methods\nshould be vetted, we don\u2019t know how to identify experts, everyone \u2013 including \u2018experts\u2019\n\u2013 is fallible. It is na\u00efve to think \u2018expert vetting\u2019 will lead to clear answers\nabout the methods we should use, and should not use. If we can\u2019t even reach\nagreement about the use of p-values, no one should believe we will ever reach\nagreement about the use of methods to detect publication bias, which will\nalways be messy at best. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I like my\nscience free from authority arguments. Everyone should do their best to\ncriticize everyone else, and if they are able, themselves. Some people will be\nin a better position to criticize some papers than others, but it is difficult\nto predict where the most fatal criticism will come from. Treating statistics\npapers published in a statistics journal as superior to papers in a psychology\njournal is too messy to be a good idea, and boil down to a form of elitism that\nI can\u2019t condone. Sometimes even a lowly 20% statistician can point out flaws in\nmethods proposed by card-carrying statisticians. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we can\ndo better is implementing actual quality control.

Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

    "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "content": "<p>I've been working on a little open source [1] search engine, nilch. I noticed that nearly all well known search engines, including the alternative ones, tend to be run by companies of various sizes with the goal to make money, so they either fill your results with ads or charge you money, and I dislike this because search is the backbone of the internet and should not be commercial, so it runs in a not-for-profit style and aims to survive on donations. Additionally I'm personally really sick of AI in my search results so I got rid of that, and I wanted DuckDuckGo bangs so it supports all of them. Like many alternative search engines, it is fully private.<p>Sadly, it currently does not have its own index but rather uses the Brave search API. Once I'm in a financial position that it's possible, I would absolutely love to build a completely new index from the ground up which is open source, as well as an open source ranking and search algorithm, to back it.<p>I posted on Reddit and got an amazing amount of feedback which I implemented a number of feature requests, so I would really like your ideas, critiques, and bug reports as well.

The entire thing: inference, weights, chat UI, it all fits in a 40KB .COM file that you can run in a CP/M emulator and hopefully even real hardware!<p>It won't write your emails, but it can be trained to play a stripped down version of 20 Questions, and is sometimes able to maintain the illusion of having simple but terse conversations with a distinct personality.<p>--<p>The extreme constraints nerd-sniped me and forced interesting trade-offs: trigram hashing (typo-tolerant, loses word order), 16-bit integer math, and some careful massaging of the training data meant I could keep the examples 'interesting'.<p>The key was quantization-aware training that accurately models the inference code limitations. The training loop runs both float and integer-quantized forward passes in parallel, scoring the model on how well its knowledge survives quantization. The weights are progressively pushed toward the 2-bit grid using straight-through estimators, with overflow penalties matching the Z80's 16-bit accumulator limits. By the end of training, the model has already adapted to its constraints, so no post-hoc quantization collapse.<p>Eventually I ended up spending a few dollars on Claude API to generate 20 questions data (see examples/guess/GUESS.COM), I hope Anthropic won't send me a C&amp;D for distilling their model against the ToS ;P<p>But anyway, happy code-golf season everybody :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417815\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417815</a></p>\n<p>Points: 36</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

Yet these opportunities also introduce risks related to equity, privacy, and student autonomy. This chapter develops the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment in education, emphasizing that trustworthy learning environments arise not only from embedding human values into AI systems but also from equipping teachers, students, and institutions with the skills to interpret, critique, and guide these technologies. Drawing on emerging research and practical case examples, we explore AI's evolution from support tool to collaborative partner, highlighting its impacts on teacher roles, student agency, and institutional governance. We propose actionable strategies for policymakers, developers, and educators to ensure that AI advances equity, transparency, and human flourishing rather than eroding them. By reframing AI adoption as an ongoing process of mutual adaptation, the chapter envisions a future in which humans and intelligent systems learn, innovate, and grow together.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21506v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.",

However, they still mainly rely on explicit textual input and do not know the real world behaviors of users. This paper proposes a context-sensitive conversational assistant framework grounded in mobile sensing data. By collecting user behavior and environmental data through smartphones, we abstract these signals into 16 contextual scenarios and translate them into natural language prompts, thus improving the model's understanding of the user's state. We design a structured prompting system to guide the LLM in generating a more personalized and contextually relevant dialogue. This approach integrates mobile sensing with large language models, demonstrating the potential of passive behavioral data in intelligent conversation and offering a viable path toward digital health and personalized interaction.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22016v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Creating physically realistic content in VR often requires complex modeling tools or predefined 3D models, textures, and animations, which present significant barriers for non-expert users. In this paper, we propose SketchPlay, a novel VR interaction framework that transforms humans' air-drawn sketches and gestures into dynamic, physically realistic scenes, making content creation intuitive and playful like drawing. Specifically, sketches capture the structure and spatial arrangement of objects and scenes, while gestures convey physical cues such as velocity, direction, and force that define movement and behavior. By combining these complementary forms of input, SketchPlay captures both the structure and dynamics of user-created content, enabling the generation of a wide range of complex physical phenomena, such as rigid body motion, elastic deformation, and cloth dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional text-driven methods, SketchPlay offers significant advantages in expressiveness, and user experience. By providing an intuitive and engaging creation process, SketchPlay lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21968v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The full-body illusion (FBI) refers to the experience of perceiving a virtual avatar as one's own body. In virtual reality (VR) environments, inducing the FBI has been shown to modulate users' bodily experiences and behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that embodying avatars with specific characteristics can influence users' actions, largely through the activation of implicit stereotypes. However, few studies have explicitly manipulated users' impressions of an avatar by introducing narrative context. The present study investigated how avatar narrativity, induced through contextual narratives, affects the FBI. Healthy participants embodied a powerful artificial lifeform avatar in VR after listening to either a positive narrative, in which the avatar used its abilities to protect others, or a negative narrative, in which it misused its power. Participants' impressions of the avatar and indices of bodily self-consciousness were subsequently assessed. The results showed that positive narratives significantly enhanced the sense of agency (SoA), and that SoA was positively correlated with participants' perceived personal familiarity with the avatar. These findings suggest that the avatar narrativity can modulate embodiment in VR.",

We then conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the system and collected expert feedback (N=5). The results suggest that our system enables effective two-way communication and supports personalized learning.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21747v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Driver drowsiness remains a primary cause of traffic accidents, necessitating the development of real-time, reliable detection systems to ensure road safety. This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21649v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Platform laborers play an indispensable yet hidden role in building and sustaining AI systems. Drawing on an eight-month ethnography of Bangladesh's platform labor industry and inspired by Gray and Suri, we conceptualize Ghostcrafting AI to describe how workers materially enable AI while remaining invisible or erased from recognition. Workers pursue platform labor as a path to prestige and mobility but sustain themselves through resourceful, situated learning - renting cyber-cafe computers, copying gig templates, following tutorials in unfamiliar languages, and relying on peer networks. At the same time, they face exploitative wages, unreliable payments, biased algorithms, and governance structures that make their labor precarious and invisible. To cope, they develop tactical repertoires such as identity masking, bypassing platform fees, and pirated tools. These practices reveal both AI's dependency on ghostcrafted labor and the urgent need for design, policy, and governance interventions that ensure fairness, recognition, and sustainability in platform futures.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21589v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Smart home automation that adapts to a user's emotional state can enhance psychological safety in daily living environments. This study proposes an emotion-aware automation framework guided by the emotional Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (eBICA), which integrates appraisal, somatic responses, and behavior selection. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment in a pseudo-smart-home environment, where participants were exposed to an anxiety-inducing event followed by a comfort-inducing automation. State anxiety (STAI-S) was measured throughout the task sequence. The results showed a significant reduction in STAI-S immediately after introducing the avoidance automation, demonstrating that emotion-based control can effectively promote psychological safety. Furthermore, an analysis of individual characteristics suggested that personality and anxiety-related traits modulate the degree of relief, indicating the potential for personalized emotion-adaptive automation. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that eBICA-based emotional control can function effectively in smart home environments and offers a foundation for next-generation affective home automation systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21881v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.",

    "title": "Learning continually with representational drift",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.22045v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep artificial neural networks famously struggle to learn from non-stationary streams of data. Without dedicated mitigation strategies, continual learning is associated with continuous forgetting of previous tasks and a progressive loss of plasticity. Current approaches to continual learning have either focused on increasing the stability of representations of past tasks, or on promoting plasticity for future learning. Paradoxically, while animals including humans achieve a desirable stability-plasticity trade-off, the responses of biological neurons to external stimuli that are associated with stable behaviors gradually change over time. This suggests that, although unstable representations have historically been seen as undesirable in artificial systems, they could be a core property of biological neural networks learning continually. Here, we examine how linking representational drift to continual learning in biological neural networks could inform artificial systems. We highlight the existence of representational drift across numerous animal species and brain regions and propose that drift reflects a mixture of homeostatic turnover and learning-related synaptic plasticity. In particular, we evaluate how plasticity induced by learning new tasks could induce drift in the representation of previous tasks, and how such drift could accumulate across brain regions. In deep artificial neural networks, we propose that representational drift is only compatible with approaches that do not explicitly prevent parameter changes to mitigate forgetting. Remarkably, jointly promoting plasticity while mitigating forgetting could in principle induce representational drift in continual learning. While we argue that drift is a byproduct rather than a solution to incremental learning, its investigation could inform approaches to continual learning in artificial systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21768v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with three interpretable parameters: decay rate, mean frequency, and noise amplitude. We develop two complementary estimation strategies. The first fits the power spectral density, amplitude distribution, and autocorrelation to recover OU-parameters. The second segments burst events and performs a statistical match between empirical spindle statistics (duration, amplitude, inter-event interval) and simulated OU output via grid search, resolving parameter degeneracies by including event counts. We extend the framework to multiple frequency bands and piecewise-stationary dynamics to track slow parameter drifts. Applied to electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia, the method identifies OU models that reproduce alpha-spindle (8-12 Hz) morphology and band-limited spectra with low residual error, enabling real-time tracking of state changes that are not apparent from band power alone. This decomposition yields a sparse, interpretable representation of transient oscillations and provides interpretable metrics for brain monitoring.",

    "title": "An augmented preference-based Bayesian approach for optimizing neuromodulation stimulation parameters using meta learning",
    "content": "Background. Electrical neuromodulation is increasingly used in the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the selection of stimulation parameters that provide optimal therapeutic benefits remains a major challenge. Moreover, identifying pathological biomarkers linking the effect of stimulation parameters to alleviating symptoms, and hence required for optimizing stimulation parameters, might not always be possible. Objective. We present an augmented, preference-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize stimulation parameters for participants undergoing neuromodulation. This algorithm incorporates two key features: I) It prioritizes the participant\u2019s preferences for stimulation parameters, making it independent of the need for pathological biomarkers. II) It leverages meta learning, using historical participant data to guide the initial optimization for new participants and overcome initial data sparsity. This approach improves both prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Approach. Consider preference training data collected from a set of historical participants who share the same neurological disorder as a new (target) participant. Within that population, there may be different response phenotypes. The goal is to identify historical participants whose stimulation-response phenotype is most similar to the target participant, and leverage their data to accelerate and improve parameter optimization for the target participant. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively performs a two-step process:(I) a novel, iterative weighting procedure that identifies historical participants with stimulation preferences closest to the target participant, and (II) meta learning that combines the training data of the identified participants with the limited training data of the target participant to train novel, augmented preference learning models. These models are then used to predict the stimulation parameters expected to maximize the target participant\u2019s preference. Mainresults. The proposed algorithm has been validated using synthetically generated data sets that simulate participant preference behavior during neuromodulation. Significance. This approach holds promise for improving personalized neuromodulation therapies and advancing treatment outcomes for neurological disorders without the need for a tedious data collection process and disease-specific pathological biomarkers.",

    "content": "Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging fusion has shown promise in enhancing brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) performance by capturing complementary neural dynamics. However, most existing fusion frameworks inadequately model the temporal asynchrony and adaptive fusion between electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), thereby limiting their ability to generalize across sessions and subjects. This work aims to develop an adaptive fusion framework that effectively aligns and integrates EEG and fNIRS representations to improve cross-session and cross-subject generalization in BCI applications. Approach. To address this, we propose STeCANet, a novel Spatiotemporal Cross-Attention Network that integrates EEG and fNIRS signals through hierarchical attention-based alignment. The model leverages fNIRS-guided spatial attention, EEG-fNIRS temporal alignment, adaptive fusion, and adversarial training to ensure robust cross-modal interaction and spatiotemporal consistency. Main results. Evaluations across three cognitive paradigms, namely motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and word generation, demonstrate that STeCANet significantly outperforms unimodal and recent multimodal baselines under both session-independent and subject-independent settings. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each sub-module and loss function, including the domain adaptation component, in boosting classification accuracy and robustness. Significance. These results suggest that STeCANet offers a robust and interpretable solution for next-generation BCI applications.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "title": "Improved filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm based on the sparrow search algorithm",
    "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

    "content": "BackgroundRetroclival subdural hematoma (rcSDH) secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological mechanisms.CaseA 24-year-old female presented with acute and persistent orthostatic headache, with no history of trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Neuroimaging revealed subdural hematomas (SDH) located in the retroclival, infratentorial, and right frontal regions. It was hypothesized that veinous rupture, resulting from venous traction due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, was the underlying mechanism. Following epidural blood patch (EBP) therapy, the patient exhibited marked symptomatic improvement and radiological resolution of hematomas on follow-up imaging.ConclusionRcSDH is considered an uncommon complication of SIH, potentially resulting from venous rupture in the retroclival subdural space due to reduced CSF pressure. SIH should be considered in cases of rcSDH. The treatment is typically focused on addressing the underlying etiology, with early diagnosis and timely intervention being essential for achieving favorable outcomes. In cases of severe brainstem compression, hematoma evacuation should be performed in conjunction with EBP.",

    "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
    "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

    "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

    "title": "Successful transfer of myoelectric skill from virtual interface to prosthesis control",
    "content": "Objective. Prosthesis control can be seen as a new skill to be learned. To enhance learning, both internal and augmented feedback are exploited. The latter represents external feedback sources that can be designed to enhance learning, e.g. biofeedback. Previous research has shown that augmented feedback protocols can be designed to induce retention by adhering to the guidance hypothesis, but it is not clear yet if that also results in transfer of those skills to prosthesis control. In this study, we test if a training paradigm optimised for retention allows for the transfer of myoelectric skill to prosthesis control. Approach. Twelve limb-intact participants learned a novel myoelectric skill during five one-hour training sessions. To induce retention of the novel myoelectric skill, we used a delayed feedback paradigm. Prosthesis transfer was tested through pre-and post-tests with a prosthesis. Prosthesis control tests included a grasp matching task, the modified box and blocks test, and an object manipulation task, requiring five grasps in total (\u2018power\u2019, \u2018tripod\u2019, \u2018pointer\u2019, \u2018lateral grip\u2019, and \u2018hand open\u2019). Main results. We found that prosthesis control improved significantly following five days of training. Importantly, the prosthesis control metrics were significantly related to the retention metric during training, but not to the prosthesis performance during the pre-test. Significance. This study shows that transfer of novel, abstract myoelectric control from a computer interface to prosthetic control is possible if the training paradigm is designed to induce retention. These results highlight the importance of approaching myoelectric and prosthetic skills from a skill acquisition standpoint, and open up new avenues for the design of prosthetic training protocols.",

    "title": "Object speed and distractor number do not affect attentional allocation in multiple object tracking",
    "content": "Keeping track of multiple moving objects across dynamic real-world scenarios such as driving, team sports, or crowded social environments is a fundamental challenge for visual attention. We have previously demonstrated that as the number of tracked objects increases, the strength of attentional facilitation allocated to each individual object decreases, limiting tracking success. It is also well established that beyond the number of tracked objects, faster-moving objects and objects embedded among higher numbers of distractors are more di[ffi]cult to track. Are these e[ff]ects on tracking di[ffi]culty also mediated by less e[ff]ective allocation of attention to tracked targets as in the case of tracking more targets? If so, one should expect the strength of attentional modulation to drop systematically with increasing speed and total number of moving stimuli. In two experiments (total n = 70), participants were instructed to track moving targets among identical distractors while we manipulated object speed (Experiment 1) and number (Experiment 2). As expected, tracking performance declined with both manipulations. However, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded during successful tracking revealed that attentional enhancement of tracked targets compared with distractors did not drop with increasing speed or object number. In summary, bottom-up changes in the stimulus display and top-down attentional manipulations a[ff]ect tracking performance in independent ways, with the balance between strength of attentional allocation and bottom-up demands of the task determining successful tracking. The allocation of attention itself seems to be determined exclusively by top-down goals rather than being reactive to bottom-up display characteristics.",

    "title": "Envelope analysis as a tool for identifying epileptic EEG patterns during the sleep-wake cycle in rats",
    "content": "Background: This research aimed to study electroencephalographic abnormalities in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine. By using the coefficient of variation of the envelope (CVE) of electroencephalography (EEG), we characterize and quantify morphological alterations in sleep-wake cycle (SWC) stages. Methods: Epilepsy was induced in 13 rats using a single dose of intraperitoneal pilocarpine injection. A second group of 13 rats served as the control. All the rats underwent polysomnography for at least two days. To do so, three channels were created using four electrodes for EEG and one more for EMG. Channels were built using contralateral lead. Results: Envelope analysis revealed global alterations in EEG morphology. Significant differences were observed in the delta and theta bands between the epileptic and control groups. Epileptic animals showed a near-total suppression of theta rhythm activity during REM sleep. Additionally, we identified a novel pattern of synchronized slow waves (sDelta), distinct from the physiological delta waves observed in non-REM sleep. Conclusion: Identifying both subtle and overt morphological abnormalities in EEG is challenging for human experts and computational methods. By applying CVE analysis to the well-known pilocarpine model, we reveal abnormal EEG dynamics with exceptional summarizing capabilities. For example, a 24-hour EEG can be synthesized into a single, easily interpretable visualization of EEG morphology. This technique and its underlying framework may serve as valuable tools for epilepsy research and potential diagnostic applications.",

    "title": "Sulfate reducing bacteria induce \u03b1-synuclein in intestinal and neuronal cells and tissues and inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal cells",
    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

    "content": "<p>I am a college student and for my entire life I have been lonely. This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that\u2019s another story. I\u2019ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I\u2019d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don\u2019t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn\u2019t last very long since they don\u2019t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I\u2019m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere and doesn\u2019t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I\u2019ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I\u2019m ugly, maybe I\u2019m not funny enough, maybe I\u2019m dumb. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right approach. But I\u2019ve tried so many different things, I\u2019ve read so many different books and yet I still can\u2019t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they\u2019d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do?

    "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
    "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

    "title": "Automated brain atrophy quantification from clinical MRI predicts early neurological deterioration in anterior choroidal artery territory infarction",
    "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",

    "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m a new developer with Aphantasia (no mental imagery).<p>A side effect of this is that regaining focus after a distraction takes me a long time (the \"23-minute lag\"). I tried standard binaural beats, but I discovered a technical flaw: streaming compression (AAC/MP3 on Spotify/YouTube) often muddies the specific phase differences required for effective entrainment.<p>I realized that to get effective entrainment, I needed lossless audio. Since I couldn't stream lossless easily, I decided to generate it locally. I built Phantas \u2013 a browser engine that uses the Web Audio API to generate raw sine waves in real-time on the client side. This ensures mathematical precision with zero compression artifacts.<p>For audio it uses Native AudioContext for dual-oscillator generation (Left/Right channel split).<p>For visuals I pair the audio with a 490nm Cyan strobe. The hardest part was syncing the visual flash (using requestAnimationFrame) to the audio pulse without \"drift\" caused by JavaScript's event loop latency.<p>I built this primarily for myself. Subjectively, it has reduced my \"ramp-up\" time from ~20 minutes to about 5 minutes.<p>I\u2019m releasing the generator for free (no login) to see if this works for others or if it's just my specific brain chemistry. I\u2019d love feedback on:<p>- Audio/Visual Sync: Does the strobe feel tight on your specific browser/refresh rate?<p>- Intensity: Are the default 14Hz flickers too aggressive?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414258\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414258</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

Only the risky functions are wrapped.</p> <h1>Available Shields</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Shield</th> <th align=\"left\">Coverage</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><code>pyrethrin.shields.pandas</code></td> <td align=\"left\"><code>read_csv</code>, <code>read_excel</code>, <code>read_json</code>, <code>read_parquet</code>, <code>concat</code>, <code>merge</code>, <code>pivot</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>qcut</code>, <code>json_normalize</code>, and more</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><code>pyrethrin.shields.numpy</code></td> <td align=\"left\">95%+ of numpy API - array creation, math ops, linalg, FFT, random, file I/O</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><code>pyrethrin.shields.fastapi</code></td> <td align=\"left\"><code>FastAPI</code>, <code>APIRouter</code>, <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code>, dependencies</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1>How I Built the Exception Declarations</h1> <p>Here's the cool part: I didn't guess what exceptions each function can raise. I built a separate tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/4tyone/arbor\">Arbor</a> that does static analysis on Python code.</p> <p>Arbor parses the AST, builds a symbol index, and traverses call graphs to collect every <code>raise</code> statement that can be reached from a function. For <code>pandas.read_csv</code>, it traced <strong>5,623 functions</strong> and found <strong>1,881 raise statements</strong> across 35 unique exception types.</p> <p>The most common ones:</p> <ul> <li><code>ValueError</code> (442 occurrences)</li> <li><code>TypeError</code> (227)</li> <li><code>NotImplementedError</code> (87)</li> <li><code>KeyError</code> (36)</li> <li><code>ParserError</code> (2)</li> </ul> <p>So the shields aren't guesswork - they're based on actual static analysis of the library code.</p> <h1>Design Philosophy</h1> <p>A few deliberate choices for the Pyrethrin as a whole:</p> <ol> <li><strong>No</strong> <code>unwrap()</code> - Unlike Rust, there's no escape hatch. You must use pattern matching. This is intentional - <code>unwrap()</code> defeats the purpose.</li> <li><strong>Static analysis at call time</strong> - Pyrethrin checks exhaustiveness when the decorated function is called, not at import time. This means you get errors exactly where the problem is.</li> <li><strong>Works with Python's match-case</strong> - You can use native pattern matching (Python 3.10+) instead of the <code>match()</code> function.</li> </ol> <h1>Installation</h1> <pre><code>pip install pyrethrin </code></pre> <h1>Links</h1> <ul> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin\">https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin</a></li> <li>Arbor (the static analysis tool): <a href=\"https://github.com/4tyone/arbor\">https://github.com/4tyone/arbor</a></li> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyrethrin/\">https://pypi.org/project/pyrethrin/</a></li> </ul> <h1>What's Next</h1> <p>Planning to add shields for:</p> <ul> <li><code>openai</code> / <code>anthropic</code></li> </ul> <p>Would love feedback on which libraries would be most useful to shield next.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Pyrethrin v0.2.0 adds &quot;Shields&quot; - drop-in replacements for pandas, numpy, and FastAPI that make their exceptions explicit. Built using static analysis that traced 5,623 functions to find what exceptions <code>pd.read_csv</code> can actually raise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mels_hakobyan\"> /u/mels_hakobyan </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pxdykw/pyrethrin_now_has_a_new_feature_shields_there_are/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pxdykw/pyrethrin_now_has_a_new_feature_shields_there_are/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "\"Why Python Is Removing The GIL\" (13.5 minutes by Core Dumped) -- good explainer on threads",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXwoAKB-SvE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXwoAKB-SvE</a></p> <p>YouTube's &quot;Ask&quot; button auto-summary, lightly proofread:</p> <blockquote> <p>This video explains the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications for parallelism in Python. Key points:</p> <p>Concurrency vs. Parallelism (1:05): The video clarifies that concurrency allows a system to handle multiple tasks by alternating access to the CPU, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution. Parallelism, on the other hand, involves true simultaneous execution by assigning different tasks to different CPU cores.</p> <p>The Problem with Python Threads (2:04): Unlike most other programming languages, Python threads do not run in parallel, even on multi-core systems. This is due to the GIL.</p> <p>Race Conditions and Mutex Locks (2:17): The video explains how sharing mutable data between concurrent threads can lead to race conditions, where inconsistent data can be accessed. Mutex locks are introduced as a solution to prevent this by allowing only one thread to access a shared variable at a time.</p> <p>How the GIL Works (4:46): The official Python interpreter (CPython) is written in C. When Python threads are spawned, corresponding operating system threads are created in the C code (5:56). To prevent race conditions within the interpreter's internal data structures, a single global mutex, known as the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), was implemented (8:37). This GIL ensures that only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time, effectively preventing true parallelism.</p> <p>Proof of Concept (9:29): The video demonstrates that the GIL is a limitation of the CPython interpreter, not Python as a language, by showing a Python implementation in Rust (Rupop) that does scale across multiple cores when running the same program.</p> <p>Why the GIL was Introduced (9:48): Guido Van Rossum, Python's creator, explains that the GIL was a design choice made for simplicity. When threads became popular in the early 90s, the interpreter was not designed for concurrency or parallelism. Implementing fine-grained mutexes for every shared internal data structure would have been incredibly complex (10:52). The GIL provided a simpler way to offer concurrency without a massive rewrite, especially since multi-core CPUs were rare at the time (11:09).</p> <p>Why the GIL is Being Removed (13:16): With the widespread adoption of multi-core CPUs in the mid-2000s, the GIL became a significant limitation to Python's performance in parallel workloads. The process of removing the GIL has finally begun, which will enable Python threads to run in parallel.</p> </blockquote> <p>There's a sponsor read (JetBrains) at 3:48-4:42.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Travel16\"> /u/Competitive_Travel16 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pxxket/why_python_is_removing_the_gil_135_minutes_by/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pxxket/why_python_is_removing_the_gil_135_minutes_by/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Ask HN: By what percentage has AI changed your output as a software engineer?",
    "content": "<p>Compared to the era before AI coding tools (say, ~2 years ago), if you had to put a number on it, how much has your productivity as a SWE changed?<p>I think about this a lot; am keen to hear what others' perceptions are. For me; the short answer: about 2x (i.e. 100% faster than pre LLMs). Long answer:<p>When I thoroughly understand the domain (i.e. business logic and real world problem I'm solving), and am familiar with the tech stack, I'm about ~10x faster for the same or better code quality.<p>When I don't understand the domain, prompts will be ambiguous or inadequate, the LLM will guess, it will do a month's work in a day, but I'll spend the next 3 weeks refactoring and realising how trash the code was, due to how trash the prompt was. All in all, it's probably still faster than pre AI, but can give a demoralising psychological phenomena where you <i>think</i> something's nearly completed only to spend weeks debugging it, refactoring, and often tossing it away and starting over.<p>In an unfamiliar tech stack, I can't always spot obvious mistakes (mistakes caused by the AI or the prompt), so it's less productive and more risky.<p>10-15% of the productivity improvement is due to improvements in the dev environment. I open ~/dotfiles with cursor and tell it a problem I have or ask for a specific improvement. It usually modifies .zshrc, .vimrc or similar (and iterates as necessary if the first attempt didn't work). Due to how fast this is (e.g. 5 minutes), I've made about 20 little tweaks that previously didn't justify the time. They definitely make me happier as well as a bit more productive.<p>But overall, taking everything into account, I'd say I'm about 2x as productive as before LLMs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409375\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409375</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "Topological data analysis reveals rigid brain-state dynamics during self-viewing in trait rumination",
    "content": "Rumination -- repetitive, negatively valenced, self-focused thought -- is a maladaptive cognitive style linked to emotional dysregulation and psychiatric risk. To investigate its neural underpinnings in a naturalistic context, we developed an fMRI paradigm in which participants observed and reflected on videos of their own past group-based problem-solving sessions, a naturalistic self-relevant context rarely examined in fMRI studies. Thirty-two adults were recorded during collaborative design-thinking tasks in triads. In a subsequent scanning session, each participant viewed two self-relevant team videos and one control team video, followed by a structured reflection period. We assessed trait rumination using the Rumination Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) and applied Topological Data Analysis (TDA) via the Mapper algorithm to model individual-level whole-brain dynamics during the task. Mapper shape graphs captured temporal transitions between brain states, allowing us to quantify the similarity of timepoints across the session. Individuals with higher trait rumination showed significantly higher temporal similarity, indicating reduced brain-state variability, during self-relevant conditions (r = 0.46, p = 0.018). This effect was not observed during the control condition. These findings suggest that rumination is associated with rigid brain dynamics during self-observation and evaluative processing. Traditional GLM and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analyses confirmed task engagement of key self-referential and social-evaluative regions, while Mapper revealed dynamic features not captured by static or group-averaged methods. Together, these findings demonstrate that trait rumination is associated with rigid large-scale brain dynamics during self-relevant cognition and highlight the value of combining naturalistic paradigms with topological approaches to capture behaviorally meaningful signatures.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "Chronic Circadian Disturbance Reshapes Hippocampal Connectivity and Cognitive Function",
    "content": "Circadian rhythms regulate a wide range of physiological and cognitive functions, yet the neural mechanisms linking circadian timing to memory remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a direct anatomical projection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the dorsal hippocampus using complementary viral anterograde, retrograde, and monosynaptic tracing approaches, alongside established indirect pathways via septal and neuromodulatory regions. These findings revise prevailing models that restrict SCN influence on hippocampal function to polysynaptic routes. Functionally, chronic circadian disruption (CCD) induced region-specific metabolic alterations and widespread reorganization of brain-wide functional connectivity (FC). Hypometabolism emerged in the SCN, dentate gyrus, and perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, accompanied by loss of SCN-hippocampal connectivity and compensatory engagement of cortical and subcortical networks. In contrast, the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus showed selective hypermetabolism and increased connectivity with the SCN, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, suggesting altered neuromodulatory control under circadian misalignment. Behaviorally, CCD produced a selective impairment in object recognition memory, while spatial memory, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse remained intact. Disrupted functional coupling within perirhinal-entorhinal-hippocampal and prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, together with altered SCN-medial septum-hippocampus connectivity, indicates that cognitive dysfunction arises from desynchronization of distributed brain networks rather than local synaptic failure. Together, these findings provide a new mechanistic framework linking circadian disruption to selective memory impairment and highlight network-level synchrony as a potential target for chronotherapeutic intervention.",

    "title": "BDH1-Dependent Ketone Body Metabolism Maintains Muller Cell Homeostasis and Retinal Function",
    "content": "Ketone body metabolism serves as an auxiliary regulator of cellular energetics and redox balance, particularly during prolonged fasting and carbohydrate restriction, yet its role in retinal homeostasis under physiological conditions remains poorly defined. {beta}-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that interconverts acetoacetate and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, and is required for efficient ketone utilization. Here, we investigated the impact of impaired endogenous ketone metabolism on retinal function using global and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)--specific BDH1 knockout (KO) mice. Global BDH1 KO mice showed reduced circulating {beta}-hydroxybutyrate and blunted fasting-induced ketone elevations, accompanied by ganglion cell loss, structural abnormalities on fundus and OCT imaging, and diminished scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) a- and b-wave amplitudes, consistent with impaired photoreceptor responses and downstream bipolar and Muller cell signaling. In contrast, RPE-specific BDH1 KO mice exhibited no changes in ERG responses or retinal morphology. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses in global KO retinas revealed disrupted Muller cell homeostasis, including reduced CAMKII-CREB activation, which is required for EAAT1 glutamate transporter expression. Administration of exogenous {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, in vitro and in vivo, restored CAMKII--CREB--EAAT1 signaling, glutamate uptake, and antioxidant gene expression in BDH1 KO mice, demonstrating a central role for ketone bodies in Muller cell metabolic support, glutamate homeostasis, and redox balance. Together with reduced BDH1 expression in human AMD retinas, these findings identify the BDH1--{beta}-hydroxybutyrate axis as a critical metabolic pathway for Muller cell function and retinal integrity, and highlight ketone metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in degenerative retinal diseases.",

    "title": "Connections of early visual areas with posterior parietal and temporal cortex in galagos, a strepsirrhine primate",
    "content": "To better understand the cortical connections and organization of visual areas in galagos, we examined the interconnections among cortical visual fields and their relationships with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and temporal regions associated with dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In five galagos, two to four distinguishable tracers were injected into different visual areas, allowing direct comparison of connection patterns within the same cases. To reveal distributions of labeled neurons for each injection, labeled cells were plotted from serial brain sections cut parallel to the flattened cortical surface and summed across sections to generate surface reconstructions. Alternate sections processed for cytoarchitectonic features were used to identify cortical borders, especially those of V1 and middle temporal visual area (MT). Overall, our results support the conclusion that regions of V2 and V3 represent the contralateral visual hemifield in parallel with V1 and with each other. However, dorsal V3, representing the lower visual hemifield, includes at least one discontinuity where representations of the upper visual field extend to the dorsal border of V2. This portion of V3 appears to belong to the dorsomedial visual area (DM), which extends rostrally from V2 into PPC. The dorsal part of the DL-V4 region receives projections from other parts of dorsolateral visual area (DL), central V1, V2 and V3, inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the MT complex, and PPC regions surrounding the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). More central portions of DL-V4 receive inputs from central representations of V1, V2, and V3, as well as from PPC regions lateral to the IPS, the MT complex, and upper IT cortex. The ventral part of DL receives projections from central V2, caudal PPC adjoining DM and ventral PPC, and from IT cortex. These patterns indicate that the DL-V4 region serves as a major node linking dorsal and ventral streams and likely includes more than one functionally distinct visual area. In addition, areas MT and DM show strong reciprocal connections with PPC, while the connections of IT cortex indicate that much of this region is visual in nature having strong connections with higher order visual areas and it is composed of multiple functionally specialized visual domains.",

    "title": "MicroRNA-383-5p alleviates hemorrhagic transformation and improves outcomes after endovascular recanalization for acute ischemic stroke",
    "content": "Background: Hemorrhage transformation (HT) after reperfusion therapy is linked with poor outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients. This study aimed to determine the role of neuronal microRNA-383 in alleviating HT-associated injury using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen-glucose deprivation reoxygenation (OGD/R) models. Methods: In neurons following OGD/R, the family of miR-383 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression was evaluated. After miR-383-5p intervention and small interfering RNA, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuronal injury were assessed. Two hundred and five hyperglycemic rats were used to establish the HT model induced by mechanical reperfusion after 5-hour MCAO, followed by 3 and 6 hours of reperfusion, and treated with intravenous administration of miR-383-5p agomir before reperfusion. Brain water content, hemorrhage severity, infarct volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuronal apoptosis, ROS production, miR-383-5p and NOX4 expression, and BBB-associated proteins were assessed. Results: MiR-383-5p expression significantly decreased in OGD/R-treated neurons, while miR-383-3p expression did not differ. Elevating miR-383-5p levels reduced neuronal injury, ROS overproduction, and NOX4 overexpression as a target of miR-383-5p, shown in OGD/R-treated neurons. In the MCAO model, increased miR-383-5p suppressed NOX4 upregulation, alleviated brain edema, infarct volume, and hemorrhage severity, reduced neuronal apoptosis and ROS overproduction, and preserved BBB integrity after mechanical reperfusion for ischemia, thereby improving short-term neurological outcomes. Conclusions: MiR-383-5p alleviates oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis, and preserves BBB integrity by regulating NOX4. Neuronal miR-383-5p could become a potential target for intervention to decrease HT and ameliorate outcomes in endovascular reperfusion treatment for acute ischemic stroke.",

    "content": "Nuclear Factor I (NFI) misexpressions in humans are associated with severe brain malformations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that NFIs regulate the broad lineage progression and lifespan of radial glial progenitors (RGPs), and consequently neocortical development in a dose-dependent manner. Human cerebral organoids carrying patient-mimicking NFI mutations exhibit expression level-dependent bidirectional impairments in RGP temporal development, coinciding with patient phenotypes. In mouse models, selective removal of NFIs leads to a dramatic protraction of RGP lineage progression and lifespan, excessive progeny output, and neocortical overgrowth and abnormal folding, whereas overexpression of NFIs accelerates RGP lineage progression, resulting in developmental stage-dependent precocious productions of diverse neural progenies. Moreover, NFIs exhibit a positive auto-regulation and progressive increase in expression, and regulate distinct temporal-specific targets underlying RGP lineage progression. These results suggest that NFIs act as evolutionarily conserved key global temporal regulators of RGP lineage progression and neocortical development.",

    "content": "Tau PET is a powerful tool to assess tau pathology in vivo; however, in comparison to MRI, its development is more recent, is rarely available at scale, and substantially more difficult to acquire. Here, we present Covariate-Modulated Attention UNet (CoMA-UNet) to synthesize subject-specific 3D tau PET from T1 MRI while incorporating in the synthesis procedure readily available covariates. Across six external validation datasets, CoMA-UNet reproduced regional patterns of tau PET uptake showing strong agreement with true PET that was generalizable across tracers. Next, we submitted the synthetic tau PET to a series of downstream clinically relevant tasks. First, MMSE associations between the synthetic tau PET were statistically indistinguishable from true PET. Second, the synthetic tau PET achieved out-of-sample diagnostic classification of dementia with an AUROC=0.99. Third, out-of-sample synthetic tau PET tracked longitudinal progression with subject-level slopes closely matching true PET. Fourth, in two independent autopsy cohorts, voxel wise synthetic tau PET images closely followed neuropathologically defined Braak-stages. These findings demonstrate that the novel CoMA-UNet MRI-based synthesis augmented with covariate information can approximate tau PET with sufficient accuracy for downstream scientific and clinical applications.",

    "title": "Brain serotonin circuit reverses decline in physical activity with age",
    "content": "Physical inactivity increases with age and is the fourth leading risk factor for mortality. Establishing the mechanisms underpinning declining physical activity (PA) with age has remained both elusive and difficult to overcome. Older (50-70 years old) compared with younger (17-30 years old) UK participants showed reduced PA, and this profile was effectively modelled in mice. Analysis of brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) revealed altered firing activity in older mice. Chemogenetically mimicking this 5-HTDR tone in young adult mice produced an older adult PA profile. Genetically blocking 5-HT activity at 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) prevented the decline in PA with age. Importantly, barring 5-HT action at 5-HT2CRs specifically within the ventral tegmental area restored youthful PA levels and strength in older mice. These data fill a longstanding knowledge gap by defining brain circuitry programming the decline in PA with age, and importantly, a means to reverse it.",

    "title": "Neural Latching Switch Circuits for temporally structured behavior",
    "content": "Elaborated temporal structures in behavior have been recognized as a hallmark of high-level cognitive processes, such as planning or natural language. Systems neuroscience experiments in behaving animals have validated cell-assemblies as a fundamental piece of neural circuitry underlying lower-level cognitive processes. Although recent research has identified neural bases for certain temporally structured behaviors, it is still an open question whether a general-purpose circuit - akin to cell assemblies - supports such behaviors. Here we introduce Neural Latching Switch Circuits and show how they can be assembled as lego-bricks to create neural architectures suited for the implementation of any procedural behavior. By focusing on increasingly complex temporal structures and leveraging a combination of theoretical tools, we demonstrate how these circuits can be mapped onto the fly's head-direction system and propose quantitative testable predictions for identifying analogous structures in mammalian brains, for instance in cortical columns. By interpreting neural architectures as computing automata we reveal surprising relationships between behavior and computation.",

    "title": "Episodic experience drives ripple reorganization and synaptic changes in the hippocampus",
    "content": "The hippocampus plays a key role in encoding episodic memory by transforming recent experience into persistent neuronal and synaptic modifications. However, the physiological processes that link real-world experience to network-level and cellular-level changes remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated how distinct types of episodic experience reorganize ensemble firing dynamics and synaptic input in the hippocampal CA1 region of freely moving rats. We identified spontaneous \"super bursts\"- brief episodes of high-frequency firing across neuronal populations - that emerged specifically during emotionally salient experiences. These bursts were followed by increased ripple firings, characterized as short, synchronous events associated with memory consolidation. Using information entropy analysis, we found that ripple firing patterns became more diverse after experience, indicating enhanced variability in neural representation. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons also underwent experience-specific reorganization. Together, these findings propose a cascading mechanism in which episodic experience triggers coordinated ensemble activity, leading to ripple reorganization and synaptic remodeling, thereby contributing to the initial encoding of memory. Our study integrates systems-level neuronal dynamics with cellular-level synaptic plasticity, offering new physiological insights into how brain circuits adapt to experience.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "A TRANSPARENT WHEEL-BASED PLATFORM FOR LOCOMOTION-ON-DEMAND AND MULTIMODAL BODY AND FACIAL KINEMATICS IN HEAD-FIXED MICE",
    "content": "Understanding how the brain transforms sensory input and internal state into coordinated action requires behavioral paradigms that provide precise, multimodal measurements of movement and arousal while remaining compatible with neural recording techniques. Here we present a modular, low-cost behavioral platform that enables locomotion-on-demand in head-fixed mice using a transparent running wheel combined with air-stream-induced stimulation. This design provides unobstructed visual access to ventral paw movements while simultaneously capturing whole-body kinematics, facial motion, and eye-related signals from multiple camera perspectives. The system integrates Arduino-based stimulus control, high-resolution encoder measurements, Raspberry Pi-based videography, and LED-driven temporal synchronization across independently acquired data streams. Using a proof-of-principle dataset from a single, well-trained animal, we demonstrate that air delivery reliably induces structured locomotion with reproducible trial timing on a transparent wheel. Optical-flow-based motion metrics and DeepLabCut pose estimation reveal robust, stimulus-locked increases in paw, limb, and facial movements during air-on epochs relative to air-off periods. LED-based synchronization enables accurate segmentation of stimulus epochs across video modalities despite differences in sampling rates, with air-on durations showing strong agreement between video-derived and DAQ-recorded measures. Correlation analyses further reveal state-dependent reorganization of coordinated body kinematics during locomotion, indicating structured coupling among limb and whole-body measures rather than a uniform increase in movement. This work establishes a flexible framework for studying stimulus-evoked locomotion and provides a platform well suited for integration with neural imaging and electrophysiology, as well as for future investigations of sensorimotor coordination and behavioral state changes in health and disease.",

    "content": "Microglia are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis, including the sleep-wake cycle, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging in both head-fixed and freely moving mice with simultaneous electroencephalogram-electromyogram (EEG-EMG) recording, we investigated microglial process dynamics and their interactions with locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NE) axons in the frontal cortex across sleep-wake states. During sleep or chemogenetic suppression of LC neurons, microglia enhanced their surveillance and increased interactions with NE axons. Correlative electron microscopy at nanometer resolution identified structural contacts between microglial process endings and NE boutons. Mechanistically, microglia-bouton interaction is primed by NE-{beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) signaling, leading to enhanced Ca2+activity in NE axons. These findings suggest that microglial interactions with NE axons promote cortical norepinephrine transmission and maintain stable wakefulness.",

    "content": "Under mesopic conditions, such as dawn or dusk, signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors contribute to perception. These parallel inputs are combined within the retina before being sent to subsequent visual areas. The integration of these kinetically-distinct parallel signals poses unique challenges for human vision. Though previous behavioral studies have found that dim lighting conditions specifically impair motion perception in human subjects, the origin of this dependence is unclear. In the present study, we create a model circuit that predicts ganglion cell responses to moving stimuli by incorporating electrophysiologically-derived circuit components into a Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, a classical motion-detection model. The model circuit demonstrates that interactions between rod- and cone-derived signals negatively impact the encoding of a moving object's direction under mesopic conditions. Furthermore, we found that the model circuit could enhance its motion discriminability if it was only sensitive to the cone-activating components of the stimuli. We conclude that rod-cone signal interference occurring at the lowest level of vision has an impact on motion direction discrimination, a higher-level task with relevance for behavior.",

    "title": "Multimodal Data Fusion Reveals Morpho-Genetic Variations in Human Cortical Neurons Associated with Tumor Infiltration",
    "content": "We introduce LetsACT (Light-Electron-Transcriptome synergistic ACTomography), a multimodal integration platform that overcomes the limitations of single-modality data acquisition and analysis of human brain cells while synergistically leveraging the strengths of each modality. Our approach enables the rapid sample preparation, cell injection, imaging, and multimodal integration of large-scale human neuronal datasets at single-cell resolution. By generating initial laser-scanning-microscopy based optical reconstruction of neuron morphologies followed by refining them using electron-microscopy derived morphological priors, we have assembled one of the largest human cortical morphology datasets to date: 8,398 neurons from 58 donors, with high cortical coverage. This platform is then applied to studying morphological impact of tumor infiltration. Pyramidal neurons in glioma-infiltrated tissues display clear volume shrinkage in somas and branches, tapering from the soma to nearby dendritic compartments. By integrating these morphological variations with spatial and bulk transcriptomic profiles, we find that glioblastoma tissues exhibit dysregulation of 15.29% of genes, including overexpression of TERT, whereas infiltrated tissues show 7.74% gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A and TP53. Our analysis implies that pyramidal neurons observed in these infiltrated tissues may involve an active defense instead of undergoing passive apoptosis. Our finding also indicates that LetsACT establishes a valuable resource for the large-scale, comprehensive morpho-genetic analysis of human tissues.",

I wanted to share a tool I've been working on to inspect Windows installers (.msi) files without needing to be on Windows or install command line tools -- essentially a web-based version of lessmsi that can run on any system (including mobile Safari on iOS).</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html\">https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html</a></p> <p>Source Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/</a> (see <em>docs/_static/msi_viewer.js</em> for the code using Pyodide)</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>The MSI Viewer and Extractor uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> as the library to read MSI files, and provides an interactive interface for examining MSI installers.</p> <p>It uses <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\">Pyodide</a> to run code that calls the <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> library directly in your browser, with some javascript to glue things together with the HTML UI elements. Since it is all running client-side, no files ever get uploaded to a remote server.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Originally it was intended as a quick toy project to see how hard it would be to get <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> running in a browser with <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\">Pyodide</a>, but I've found it rather convenient in my day job for quickly extracting contents of MSI installers. I'd categorize it as nearly production ready.</p> <p>It is probably most useful for:</p> <ul> <li>Security researchers and sysadmins who need to quickly peek inside an installer without running it setting up a Windows VM</li> <li>Developers who want a uniform cross-platform way of working with MSI files, particularly on macOS/Linux where tools like lessmsi and Orca aren't available</li> <li>Repackaging workflows that need to include a subset of files from existing installers</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ul> <li>vs Orca/lessmsi: While very capable, they are Windows-only and require a download and for Orca, running an MSI installer pulled from a Windows SDK. This is cross-platform and requires no installation.</li> <li>vs 7-zip: It understands the MSI installer structure and can be used to view data in streams, which 7-zip just dumps as files that aren't human readable. 7-zip for extracting files more often than not results in incorrect file names and lacks any semblance of the directory structure defined by tables in the MSI installer.</li> <li>vs msitools: It does not require any installation, and it also works on Windows, giving consistency across all operating systems.</li> <li>vs other online viewers: It doesn't upload any files to a remote server, and keeps files local to your device.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nightlark192\"> /u/Nightlark192 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px67mn/inspect_and_extract_files_from_msi_installers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px67mn/inspect_and_extract_files_from_msi_installers/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by CAG expansion in HTT, yet how somatic repeat instability and huntingtin aggregation relate to selective cell loss in the human brain remains unclear. We have developed a multimodal spatial transcriptomics approach that enables defining transcriptional programs with subcellular resolution, somatic CAG repeat lengths, and six other pathology marks including huntingtin aggregates in every cell of intact brain sections. Imaging 428,173 cells in HD cortex revealed selective vulnerability: L5/6 NP and L6b deep-layer excitatory neurons undergo more than 50% loss, closely linked to very large (more than 380+/-55) somatic expansions. Intranuclear aggregation was most prevalent at intermediate somatic repeat expansion (220-300 CAGs) and was accompanied by broader transcriptional changes. In contrast, chandelier and somatostatin+ inhibitory interneurons are lost despite only modest repeat expansion or aggregation. These data provide a comprehensive resource and establish a broadly applicable framework for connecting repeat expansion and protein pathology across diverse cell types.",

    "content": "Soluble A{beta}1-42 oligomers are potent neurotoxins that disrupt synaptic function, alter glial responses, and lead to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Riluzole, a glutamate modulator approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, reduces neuronal hyperexcitability, yet its in vivo effects on A{beta} oligomer-induced cognitive dysfunction and glial alterations remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether riluzole ameliorates A{beta}1-42 oligomer-induced memory impairment and associated cellular changes in the hippocampus. A{beta}1-42 oligomers were bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal CA1 region of freely moving male rats, followed by daily riluzole administration for seven days. Behavioral analyses revealed that riluzole significantly improved hippocampus-dependent memory, including contextual learning and spatial working memory, without affecting locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, or pain sensitivity. At the cellular level, riluzole reduced neuronal A{beta} accumulation and attenuated synaptic and dendritic pathology, while increasing A{beta} association with astrocytes and microglia in parallel with enhanced CD11b-related recognition and lysosomal processing. Riluzole also attenuated A{beta}-induced neuronal apoptosis, dendritic degeneration, and dendritic spine loss across multiple hippocampal subregions. In addition, riluzole limited complement-dependent synaptic elimination by microglia and preserved synaptic integrity. Although A{beta} oligomers induced robust recruitment of astrocytes and microglia, riluzole did not suppress glial activation; instead, it promoted morphological remodeling and shifted both astrocytes and microglia toward phenotypes associated with neuroprotection. Together, these findings support the idea that coordinated remodeling of glial responses contributes to the ability of riluzole to counteract A{beta} oligomer toxicity, promoting glia-mediated amyloid handling, synaptic stability, and cognitive recovery.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
    "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

    "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
    "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

    "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
    "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

    "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
    "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

I've tried to avoid hidden behavior. No magic, no guesses.</p> <h3>Target audience</h3> <p><code>yastrider</code> is meant to be used by developers who need a defensive, simple and dependency free way to clean and tidy input. Some use cases are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Backend developers</strong>: tidying userninput before database storage</li> <li><strong>DBAs</strong>: string tidying and normalization for indexing and comparison.</li> </ul> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Of course, there are some libraries that do something similar to what I'm doing here:</p> <ul> <li><code>unicodedata</code>: low level Unicode handling</li> <li><code>python-slugify</code>: creating slugs for urls and identifiers</li> <li><code>textprettify</code>: General string utilities</li> </ul> <p><code>yastrider</code> is a toolkit built on top of <code>unicodedata</code> , wrapping commonly used, error-prone, text tidying and normalization patterns into small, compostable functions with sensible defaults.</p> <h3>A quick example</h3> <p>```python from yastrider import normalize_text</p> <p>normalize_text(&quot;H\u00ebllo world&quot;)</p> <h2>&gt; 'Hello world'</h2> <p>```</p> <p>I started this project as a personal need (repeating the same <code>unicodedata</code> + regex patterns over and over), and turning into a learning exercise on writing clean, explicit and dependency-free libraries.</p> <p>Feedback, critiques and suggestions are welcome \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pCantropus\"> /u/pCantropus </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pwexmp/yastrider_a_small_toolkit_for_string_tidying_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pwexmp/yastrider_a_small_toolkit_for_string_tidying_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "EEG-based meditation decoding: tackling subject variability with spatial and temporal alignment",
    "content": "Objective. Meditation and mindfulness are increasingly recognized as important in improving mental well-being. However, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback systems supporting these practices typically fail to generalize to unseen subjects. This study investigates the application of both spatial and spectral alignment to EEG to improve the classification of meditation and rest states for new subjects without any model retraining. Approach. Two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques are employed to reduce differences between subjects in their EEG recordings. The first, Riemannian Space Data Alignment (RSDA), adjusts and brings together patterns of brain activity across electrodes (spatial domain). The second, Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN), aligns the distribution of brain rhythms across frequencies (spectral domain). Each method is evaluated separately, in combination, and in interaction with z-score normalization. Classification between meditation and rest is performed on the aligned time series using EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network architecture, with leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation to assess generalization across subjects. All experiments are based on a publicly available dataset of meditation EEG recordings from 53 subjects, including both novice and expert meditators. Main results. The combined RSDA+CMMN approach significantly improved LOSO classification accuracy (66.6%) compared to non-aligned (55.7%) and z-score normalized (59.6%) baselines, even though it did not improve overall harmonization. Spectral analysis identified consistent classification contributions from the Theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz), Alpha (8\u201314\u2009Hz), and Beta (14\u201330\u2009Hz) bands, while spatial analysis highlighted Frontopolar and Temporal regions as critical for distinguishing the mental states of meditation and rest. Significance. This work is the first to explore both spatial and spectral alignment in subject-independent meditation decoding for improved cross-subject generalization. Aligning EEG time series without retraining provides a practical solution for real-time neurofeedback, thereby reducing subject variability and paving the way toward calibration-free neurotechnology that supports mental well-being.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>About a month ago, I released PyImageCUDA, a GPU image processing library. I mentioned it would be the foundation for a parametric node editor. Well, here it is!</p> <p>PyImageCUDA Studio is a node-based image compositor with GPU acceleration and headless Python automation. It lets you design image processing pipelines visually using 40+ nodes (generators, effects, filters, transforms), see results in real-time via CUDA-OpenGL preview, and then automate batch generation through a simple Python API.</p> <p>Demos:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0ab3da-d961-4587-a67c-7d290a008017\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0ab3da-d961-4587-a67c-7d290a008017</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c6a81d-5741-40e0-ad55-86a171a8aaa4\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c6a81d-5741-40e0-ad55-86a171a8aaa4</a></p> <p>The workflow: design your template in the GUI, save as <code>.pics</code> project, then generate thousands of variations programmatically: ```python from pyimagecuda_studio import LoadProject, set_node_parameter, run</p> <p>with LoadProject(&quot;certificate.pics&quot;): for name in [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;]: set_node_parameter(&quot;Text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, f&quot;Certificate for {name}&quot;) run(f&quot;certs/{name}.png&quot;) ```</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is for developers who need to generate image variations at scale (thumbnails, certificates, banners, watermarks), motion designers creating frame sequences, anyone applying filters to videos or creating animations programmatically, or those tired of slow CPU-based batch processing.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike Pillow/OpenCV (CPU-based, script-only) or Photoshop Actions (GUI-only, no real API), this combines visual design with programmatic control. It's not trying to replace Blender's compositor (which is more complex and 3D-focused) or ImageMagick (CLI-only). Instead, it fills the gap between visual tools and automation libraries\u2014providing both a node editor for design AND a clean Python API for batch processing, all GPU-accelerated (10-350x faster than CPU alternatives on complex operations).</p> <hr /> <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> - Built on PyImageCUDA (custom CUDA kernels, not wrappers) - PySide6 for GUI - PyOpenGL for real-time preview - PyVips for image I/O</p> <p><strong>Install:</strong> <code>bash pip install pyimagecuda-studio </code></p> <p><strong>Run:</strong> ```bash pics</p> <h1>or</h1> <p>pyimagecuda-studio ```</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda-studio\">https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda-studio</a> - PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyimagecuda-studio/\">https://pypi.org/project/pyimagecuda-studio/</a> - Core library: <a href=\"https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda\">https://github.com/offerrall/pyimagecuda</a> - Performance benchmarks: <a href=\"https://offerrall.github.io/pyimagecuda/benchmarks/\">https://offerrall.github.io/pyimagecuda/benchmarks/</a></p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Python 3.10+, NVIDIA GPU (GTX 900+), Windows/Linux.

    "title": "Characterization of aperiodic and theta activity in preterm infants using EEG: Insights into cerebral maturation and inter-individual variability",
    "content": "Preterm birth disrupts critical processes of brain development, impacting the maturation of brain structural organisation and functional activity. In early development, theta oscillations are thought to play a key role in supporting the formation and development of functional networks, but their maturation appears vulnerable to prematurity. Traditional EEG spectral analyses have indicated marked development of theta power in early infancy, but these approaches mix oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity, limiting insights into the mechanisms underlying the neural changes. Using spectral parametrisation, we aimed to evaluate developmental changes in aperiodic activity and periodic theta power in infants born very preterm compared to full-terms, and to further explore whether clinical factors and brain microstructure could explain the inter-individual variability within preterms. High-density EEG was acquired during active/REM sleep at term-equivalent age (TEA) and 2 months corrected age (2mCA) in 41 very preterm infants and 13 full-term controls. Spectral parameterization was used to extract aperiodic components (offset, exponent) and periodic theta power globally and across spatial clusters (anterior, central, posterior). From TEA to 2mCA, aperiodic offset and exponent, as well as theta power, increased with no differences between preterm and full-term infants. Cluster-based analyses revealed regional differences at each age and in their maturation over two months. At TEA, aperiodic metrics and theta power were stronger in anterior compared with posterior areas, but this regional landscape shifted by 2mCA for aperiodic metrics, driven by pronounced increases in aperiodic offset and exponent in posterior areas from TEA to 2mCA. Within preterms, inter-individual variability in aperiodic and periodic metrics at TEA was partly explained by clinical risk factors and variations in brain microstructure, as assessed with diffusion MRI at the same age. Male sex was characterised by lower theta power; lower gestational age at birth was associated with lower exponent; being small for gestational age was related to higher theta power, and invasive ventilation was linked to lower offset and exponent. Additionally, higher theta power correlated with lower cortical fractional anisotropy, consistent with more advanced cortical maturation. Collectively, these findings indicate that EEG spectral parameterization combined with spatial analysis provides a sensitive framework for characterising the postnatal maturation of brain activity in infants, as well as early vulnerabilities associated with prematurity and perinatal adversity.",

    "title": "Differential Cerebral White Matter Tract Alterations in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Revealed by Ultra-High Field 7T Diffusion-Weighted Imaging",
    "content": "Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic worry and emotional dysregulation, yet its underlying white matter (WM) architecture remains inconsistent in previous neuroimaging studies. This study aimed to delineate microstructural WM alterations in GAD using ultra-high field (7T) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced correlational tractography, evaluating their associations with symptom severity and diagnostic-aided value. Methods: Eighty-eight participants (27 GAD, 61 healthy controls, HCs) underwent 7T DTI scanning with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain correlational tractography was applied to identify tracts exhibiting significant group-related differences in diffusion indices while controlling for demographic covariates. Associations with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) scores were examined, and machine learning-based models were used to assess the diagnostic-aided utility of identified WM features. Results: Two tract bundles showed significant fractional anisotropy (FA) alterations in GAD: decreased FA in the right prefrontal pathway (P-FDR = 0.039) and increased FA in the right cingulum (P-FDR < 0.001). The anterior portions of both tracts exhibited stronger effects of GAD. FA in the right cingulum positively correlated with HAM-A and PSWQ scores, indicating that greater microstructural coherence was associated with higher anxiety and worry severity (both P-FDR < 0.001). Inclusion of WM features could improve classification performance beyond neuropsychological measures alone. Conclusions: Ultra-high field 7T tractometry revealed a differential pattern of WM abnormalities in GAD, suggesting weakened prefrontal control and hyper-integrated cingulate connectivity as structural correlates of emotional dysregulation. These findings indicate the potential of 7T DTI markers for advancing mechanistic and diagnostic understanding of GAD.",

    "title": "Bivalent habenula modulation of human monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways",
    "content": "The habenula is implicated in signaling negative reward prediction errors (RPE), yet direct causal evidence demonstrating its influence on downstream human brain circuits is limited. Using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and dynamic causal modelling across two negative RPE-inducing experimental tasks, we characterize habenula-directed connectivity with monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways in healthy adults. Negative feedback drove strong habenula inhibition of ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus activity, while positive feedback had an excitatory effect. These core effects are replicated across reversal learning and perceptual decision uncertainty tasks, establishing a generalizable mechanism for behavioral adaptation. Task-specific modulatory effects emerged in pathways between the subcortical and cortical regions (ventral tegmental area[-&gt;]dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus[-&gt;]medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex[-&gt;]habenula), revealing context-dependent cortical elaboration of negative RPE-driven habenula signals. This provides the first evidence in humans for bivalent causal modulation of habenula function on monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways, demonstrating how the brain integrates negative and positive signals to guide adaptive behavior.",

Instead of mutable virtualenv directories, px builds exact dependency graphs into a global CAS and runs directly from them. Environments are reproducible, deterministic, and shared across projects.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> This is an <strong>alpha</strong>, CLI-first tool aimed at developers who care about reproducibility, determinism, and environment correctness. It is <em>not</em> yet a drop-in replacement for uv/venv and does <strong>not</strong> currently support IDE integration.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> Compared to tools like venv, Poetry, Pipenv, or uv:</p> <ul> <li>px environments are <strong>immutable artifacts</strong>, not mutable directories</li> <li>identical dependency graphs are <strong>deduplicated globally</strong></li> <li>native builds are produced in <strong>pinned build environments</strong></li> <li>execution can be <strong>CAS-native</strong> (no env directory required), with materialized fallbacks only when needed</li> </ul> <p>Repo &amp; docs: <a href=\"https://github.com/ck-zhang/px\">https://github.com/ck-zhang/px</a> Feedback welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ck-zhang\"> /u/ck-zhang </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pwatba/px_immutable_python_environments_alpha/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pwatba/px_immutable_python_environments_alpha/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "The combination of elevated neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage induces Pink1-dependent mitophagy in axons",
    "content": "Mitochondria are critical for synaptic function. At the synapse, mitochondria produce ATP and buffer calcium, both of which are required for synapse function. Defects in mitochondrial maintenance are linked to neurodegenerative disease, yet we know little about what regulates the need for mitophagy at the synapse. We assessed the impact of neuron type, activity, and mitochondrial damage on mitophagy rate in axons of larval zebrafish. Using electron and confocal microscopy, we show that mitophagy occurs in the axon terminal of postsynaptic sensory neurons and presynaptic motor neurons at similar rates. Increasing neuronal activity or mitochondria damage does not impact the amount of mitophagy in axons. Only by combining neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage does the rate of mitophagy increase in the axon and this increase requires Pink1. Together, our data support a model in which increased mitophagic demand in axons is rare and uniquely sensitive to Pink1 disruption.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to exhibit amyloid pathology years before the onset of cognitive impairment. While early detection and pathological modification are considered essential for suppressing or preventing disease progression, effective strategies remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether inducing a hibernation-like state via Q neuron-induced hypometabolism/hypothermia state (QIH) suppresses the progression of early amyloid pathology in AD model mice. To maximize the total duration of QIH, we established and implemented a repetitive QIH (rQIH) protocol. Using 82E1 antibody immunostaining, we found that rQIH significantly reduced early amyloid plaque burden, and the magnitude of this suppression was positively correlated with rQIH duration. rQIH also decreased the formation of dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. These findings demonstrate that a hibernation-like physiological state can attenuate early amyloid pathology, providing a potential foundation for future hibernation-based therapeutic strategies for AD.",

    "content": "The visual system is known to integrate sensory information across both space and time, but these dimensions are often studied separately. Here we provide novel behavioural evidence for an early integration over space and time, and propose a computational model of this integration that is biologically plausible. We designed a controlled task that forces human participants to integrate information over both space and time to perform well. Stimuli were temporally segmented rings of oriented elements and participants had to detect a missing element in the ring. We found that temporal integration was enhanced when successive visual events were temporally proximate, spatially aligned to form a continuous contour, but also, and more surprisingly, when they were brief. Notably, the spatial effects on integration are temporally asymmetric: integration is facilitated when more events are presented earlier in the sequence, and even more so when they form a collinear contour. These findings indicate that temporal integration is sensitive to both the spatial configuration and the number of visual events presented over time, supporting a continuous rather than discrete process at early visual stages. All of these results are well accounted for by a computational model in which temporal integration arises from the overlap of internal signals generated by individual visual events. These signals are shaped by a spatially and temporally tuned divisive normalisation mechanism and integrated via coincidence detection. Predictions from this model match human performance in seminal past work as well as novel stimulus displays, offering an account of how spatio temporal interactions determine what we perceive and when.",

    "content": "Restless legs syndrome afflicts nearly half of all patients with end-stage renal disease, imposing profound burdens through relentless insomnia and functional decline. Dopaminergic agents--the established first-line therapy--trigger augmentation, a paradoxical intensification of symptoms that leaves patients worse than when they began treatment. The resultant therapeutic impasse has left a vulnerable population without effective recourse. Here we demonstrate that pregabalin, an alpha2delta; calcium channel ligand with established renal safety, provides robust and sustained symptom relief in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dialysis patients with uremic restless legs syndrome. Clinical benefits emerged rapidly and intensified over three months, with pregabalin-treated patients showing more than twofold greater likelihood of categorical improvement in disease severity. In complementary animal electrophysiology experiments, pregabalin distinctively suppressed cortical hyperarousal--a hallmark of restless legs syndrome--by rebalancing low- and high-frequency oscillatory activity patterns, particularly in motor regions. This neural signature closely resembled that of gabapentin, another therapeutically effective alpha2delta ligand, suggesting convergent mechanisms. Beyond establishing pregabalin as an urgently needed alternative to dopaminergic therapy, our results demonstrate that cortical oscillatory profiling can reveal mechanistic convergence among candidate therapeutics, offering a rational preclinical screening strategy for neurological disorders before exposure of high-risk patient populations to experimental interventions. This framework may accelerate therapeutic discovery while reducing clinical trial risks in vulnerable populations.",

    "title": "A shared ensemble in the prelimbic cortex links impulsivity and anxiety-like behavior.",
    "content": "Mental health disorders often share overlapping behavioral and neural features, yet it remains unclear why these relationships emerge or whether they reflect common underlying neural processes. To explore this, we recorded prelimbic (PL) activity using endoscopic calcium imaging as rats completed a battery of tasks assessing impulsivity, distress tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, incentive salience (Pavlovian conditioned approach), and sensation-seeking in a novel environment (locomotor activity). By collecting neural and behavioral measures across all tasks within each animal, we were able to investigate whether PL activity tracked processes that were either unique to individual behaviors, shared across multiple behaviors, or both. We found that PL activity was significantly predictive of each of the behaviors except locomotor activity. Subsequent analyses revealed shared behavioral structure across tasks, with one latent dimension reflecting high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. Individual variability across this particular dimension was strongly predicted by a neural structure comprising shared PL activity across four of the behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship was driven by a subset of PL neurons that shared patterns of activity across multiple tasks, forming a shared neural ensemble. Importantly, animals with a greater tendency to share neural ensembles exhibited a stronger link between high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a small, shared ensemble of PL neurons tracked activity across multiple clinically-relevant behaviors to predict an approach/avoidance phenotype characterized by high impulsivity and low anxiety. This points toward a targetable neural population that may help explain why diverse psychiatric symptoms often co-occur within individuals.",

We usually throw that information away and rely on external docs, tribal knowledge, or comments.</p> <p>So I implemented TypeID for Python and an experimental layer on top of it that explores the idea of explainable identifiers.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>You can get a structured answer, for example:</p> <ul> <li>what kind of entity this ID represents (via prefix)</li> <li>when it was likely created (from the sortable component)</li> <li>whether it is time-sortable</li> <li>whether it\u2019s safe to expose publicly</li> <li>what guarantees it provides (uniqueness, randomness, monotonicity)</li> <li>what spec / format it follows</li> </ul> <p>Without database access, btw.</p> <p>It might be used for debugging logs where all you have is an ID.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <ol> <li>Install the library with yaml support:</li> </ol> <p><code>bash pip install typeid-python[yaml] </code></p> <ol> <li>Use TypeID as a user's id:</li> </ol> <p>```python from dataclasses import dataclass, field from typing import Literal from typeid import TypeID, typeid_factory</p> <p>UserID = TypeID[Literal[&quot;user&quot;]] gen_user_id = typeid_factory(&quot;user&quot;)</p> <p>@dataclass class UserDTO: user_id: UserID = field(default_factory=gen_user_id) full_name: str = &quot;A J&quot;

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><strong>vresto</strong> is a Python toolkit that simplifies working with individual satellite products (mainly) from the Copernicus Sentinel program, with a current focus on Sentinel2 (L1C and L2A products). It provides three interfaces:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Web Interface</strong> \u2013 An interactive map-based UI (<code>niceGUI</code>) to visually search and filter satellite products by location, date range, and cloud cover. <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto/blob/main/docs/assets/vresto_demo.gif\">Demo here</a></li> <li><strong>Python API</strong> \u2013 Clean, programmatic access for automation and batch processing</li> <li><strong>CLI</strong> \u2013 Command-line tools for quick searches and downloads</li> </ol> <p>Key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Search satellite products by name or geographic location</li> <li>Download individual spectral bands (RGB, infrared, etc.) for analysis and artifact detection</li> <li>Access metadata and quicklook previews</li> <li>Inspect and visualize Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A imagery (with support for more coming later)</li> <li>Handle S3 authentication securely</li> </ul> <h1>Why I built this</h1> <p>This came from a real need when exploring and cleaning large satellite datasets for ML model training: researchers and developers need a fast, intuitive way to find <strong>individual</strong> products, inspect their bands for quality issues, and download specific data\u2014without context-switching between multiple tools and programming languages.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>ML/AI researchers</strong> \u2013 Building datasets from satellite imagery and need to explore/clean individual products</li> <li><strong>Geospatial researchers &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Analyzing multispectral imagery for environmental monitoring, agriculture, or climate research</li> <li><strong>GIS developers &amp; engineers</strong> \u2013 Building Python applications that need streamlined satellite data discovery and access</li> <li><strong>Data analysts &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Working with remote sensing data for analysis and visualization</li> <li><strong>Hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts</strong> \u2013 Anyone curious about satellite data and earth observation</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The most popular alternatives to searching Satellite products with Python (and offering a CLI) are <a href=\"https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag\">eodag</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/CDSETool/CDSETool\">CDSETool</a>. The former seems to be a quite mature project with a complete suite that goes beyond the scope of &quot;single products&quot;, while the latter focuses more on product downloads. Neither offers an intuitive web interface like that of vresto. However, an integration with <code>eodag</code> could be interesting in the future to combine the best of both worlds.</p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <p><code>vresto</code> is built on top of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem catalog, providing an intuitive Python-first interface for the most common tasks: finding individual products, examining their metadata and spectral bands, and downloading what you need. Whether you prefer clicking on a map, writing a few lines of Python, or using the CLI, <code>vresto</code> keeps you focused on the data rather than the infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd17 <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto\">github.com/kalfasyan/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 <strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://kalfasyan.github.io/vresto\">kalfasyan.github.io/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udce6 <strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/vresto/\">pypi.org/project/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f <strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/\">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Free Copernicus account required (get one at dataspace.copernicus.eu).

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Breath as an internal context: Respiratory phase alignment between encoding and retrieval optimizes memory performance.",
    "content": "Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory rhythms are crucial for cognitive functions. Although recent findings suggest that respiratory activity may serve as an internal contextual framework during memory processes, the contribution of specific respiratory phases to encoding and retrieval remains unclear. Here, we investigated the breathing-dependent performance of 30 healthy volunteers during a visual delayed matching-to-sample recognition memory task while their nasal respiration was monitored. Reaction times (RTs) decreased when visual cues were both encoded and retrieved during the late phase of exhalation. In contrast, longer RTs were observed during late exhalation at retrieval when encoding occurred either (i) during a period that encompassed inspiratory onset (i.e., exhalation-to-inhalation transition or EI transition) or (ii) during the early phase of inhalation. These contrasting outcomes under identical retrieval conditions highlight the phase-dependent effects of respiration, specifically the alignment of respiratory timing between encoding and retrieval. Importantly, we found that the late phase of exhalation during both encoding and retrieval may represent a favorable temporal window for shaping memory performance. These findings suggest that respiratory phase alignment modulates memory processes by providing an interoceptive, phase-dependent context for cognition.",

    "title": "Capturing Rapid Behavioral Adaptation in an Updated Theory of the Hippocampal Cognitive Map and its Neural Implementation",
    "content": "Animals rapidly and flexibly adapt their behavior by forming an internal cognitive map. The cognitive map has been studied at multiple levels, including normative, representational, and mechanistic accounts, often focused on the role of the hippocampus. Here, we propose a framework extending the normative successor representation (SR) theory and its link to hippocampal representations and processes, incorporating recent insights into the neural basis of rapid adaptation in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. In our model, CA3 uses temporally symmetric behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP) to encode spatiotemporal proximity experienced during exploration, CA1 uses temporally asymmetric BTSP to encode a perceived salience-weighted SR, and downstream areas learn successor feature predictions that can guide behavior in accordance with a behaving animal's motivational state. Through simulations of a rodent exploring a maze, we show that the network rapidly learns this representation and further strengthens the map by generating spontaneous replay activity during subsequent offline phase. Behavioral simulations show how these processes give rise to motivational state-dependent choice, rapid behavioral adaptation to changes in the availability or reward, and one-trial avoidance learning.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

    "title": "Profiling miRNAs involved in Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Differentiation and Maturation",
    "content": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in cellular development and differentiation across species. Although the importance of miRNAs in oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLLC) differentiation has been extensively studied in rodent models, their roles in human OL development remain less understood. To address this gap, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter system designed to study human OLs and OL progenitor cells (OPCs). Using an optimized differentiation protocol, we used the reporter hESCs to generate and isolate well-characterized OLLCs at specific developmental stages and performed next-generation sequencing-based miRNA profiling to identify stage-specific miRNAs enriched during OL lineage specification and maturation. In addition to canonical miRNAs known to be enriched at various stages of OL development, our study identified several lesser-known miRNAs with distinct stage-specific enrichment patterns that may serve as useful molecular markers for classifying human CNS cell types in future studies. Target analysis of OPC- and OL-enriched miRNAs revealed key genes, including transcription factors ZNF488 and DLX1, cytoskeletal regulator CSNK2B, and potassium channel gene KCNJ1, along with key signaling pathways such as AKT, SMAD2/3, estrogen receptor, and insulin signaling, which regulate OPC and OL lineage function. These findings advance our understanding of the OLLC-specific miRNAs, and miRNA-mediated regulatory networks governing human OL differentiation and maturation and provide promising therapeutic targets for future studies aimed at restoring myelin integrity and improving outcomes in demyelinating diseases.",

    "title": "Modeling Individualized Adolescent Mental Health through a Multifactorial Causal Framework to Identify Potential Intervention Strategies",
    "content": "Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of psychopathology. During this time, physiological changes and environmental exposures jointly shape brain development and influence cognitive and personality maturation, collectively heightening vulnerability to mental disorders. However, the complexity of interactions between these factors has hindered a systems-level understanding of mental health and the causal roles of cognition and personality in psychopathology. In this study, we proposed a multifactorial causal framework integrating brain, pubertal, environmental, and behavioral factors to characterize heterogeneity in adolescent mental health trajectories at the individual level. We then investigated latent causal pathways linking cognition and personality to mental health outcomes and identified potential personalized intervention targets. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset (N = 4,501), we analyzed 165 behavioral pairs connecting cognition and personality traits to mental health symptoms. Using cross-sectional multivariate mediation and longitudinal interaction-inclusive analyses, we identified 68 behavioral pairs showing significant causal relationships, with brain and environmental exposures contributing to most pathways, while pubertal factors exhibited limited involvement. Individualized interpretive analyses further revealed 23 pairs suggesting potential interventions with response rates exceeding 50%. Among these, behavioral inhibition, negative urgency, and processing speed emerged as the most common intervention targets, whereas psychosis symptoms and attention problems were the most likely issues to improve. Overall, our study advances a comprehensive framework capturing the multifactorial and heterogeneous nature of adolescent mental health, delineates specific causal pathways from cognitive and personality traits to psychopathology, and provides a principled basis for potential individualized intervention strategies.",

    "title": "Active zone remodeling by Bruchpilot couples synaptic architecture to Kv1/Shaker excitability control",
    "content": "Presynaptic active zones are known to undergo state-dependent remodeling across sleep, circadian, and experience-dependent conditions, yet how such structural changes influence synaptic computation and excitability has remained unclear. Here, we address this gap by examining the functional consequences of physiological upscaling of the active zone scaffold Bruchpilot (BRP), within the range previously observed during natural state-dependent plasticity. We show that moderate BRP elevation expands the number of functional release sites while surprisingly reducing vesicle release probability, thereby establishing a presynaptic operating mode with selectively enhanced transmission at intermediate firing frequencies. This remodeled mode depends on Kv1/Shaker potassium channels, which normally constrain the increased structural capacity generated by BRP; accordingly, perturbation of Shaker abolishes BRP-dependent reductions in release probability and unmasks an enlarged synaptic output capacity. To test the functional relevance of this coupling, we examined sleepless mutants, in which Kv1/Shaker channels are destabilized and presynaptic remodeling is compromised. We show that direct, physiological-level BRP upscaling selectively restores the Shaker/Hyperkinetic channel complex from near-undetectable levels toward normal abundance without inducing global proteomic changes, and correspondingly rescues excitability balance, oxidative stress resistance, lifespan, and mid-term memory. Together, these findings identify a mechanistic coupling between active zone architecture and intrinsic excitability control and demonstrate how presynaptic structural plasticity shapes frequency-dependent transmission and functional robustness under stress.",

    "title": "Chronic stress abnormalize microglial-vascular interaction via AT1R signaling and microglia activation to drive depression-like behaviors",
    "content": "Depression entails a range of pathological processes in the brain, typically characterized by microglia activation, neural dysfunction, and vascular dysregulation. While it is well established that activated microglia inflict damage to neurons through direct and indirect microglia-neuron interactions, their interaction with vasculature and the associated regulation of vascular structure and function in depression remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), we find that in stressed mice, activated microglia present reduced motility and decreased contact area with vasculature, which is accompanied by pathological vascular structure and function, marked by reduced vessel density, narrowed vascular diameters, and sluggish blood flow velocity. We observe that vascular structure in the stressed mice is rapidly modified by the vascular-contacted microglia. These vascular-contacted microglia show upregulated angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression, which is not present in the vascular-uncontacted microglia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AT1R signaling together with microglia activation under chronic stress are critical mediators for the altered microglial-vascular contact situation, vascular dysregulation, as well as the depression-like behaviors. Together, our findings reveal that under CUS, the aberrant microglial-vascular interaction, including the dysregulated microglial vasoregulation arising from AT1R signaling and microglia activation, leads to depression, forging a new link between chronic stress and depression.",

    "title": "The impact of downsampling on data quality, univariate measurement and multivariate pattern analysis in event-related potential research",
    "content": "The choice of sampling rate is a critical preprocessing step in event-related potential (ERP) research, yet its impact on different analytic approaches remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically evaluated how downsampling affects data quality measured via Standardized Measurement Error (SME), conventional univariate ERP metrics (mean amplitude, peak amplitude, peak latency, and 50% area latency), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA; decoding). We analyzed seven commonly studied ERP components: P3, N400, N170, N2pc, mismatch negativity, error-related negativity, and lateralized readiness potential collected from neurotypical young adults. Results showed that both amplitude- and latency-based scores were significantly affected by sampling rate changes, particularly for 50% area latency that presented increased SME (reduced data quality) at lower sampling rates. Amplitude-based measures and their corresponding effect sizes were more influenced by sampling rate variations, whereas latency-based measures were comparatively stable across different temporal resolutions. In contrast, multivariate decoding performance remained highly robust, with decoding accuracy and effect sizes showing minimal variation even at the lowest sampling rate (e.g., 64 Hz). Overall, these findings suggest that caution should be exercised when employing lower sampling rates for data quality and conventional univariate ERP analyses. Nevertheless, lower sampling rates (e.g., 64 Hz) may still be appropriate for decoding analyses, particularly in studies where precise temporal resolution is not critical. For researchers analyzing ERP data with similar components, noise levels, and participant populations as in this study, following these recommendations should yield robust statistical power.",

    "title": "Activation of neurogenesis improves amyloid-\u03b2 pathology and cognitive function through AMP kinase signaling in Alzheimer's disease model mice",
    "content": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging and in neurological disorders, leading to cognitive impairment. We previously demonstrated that a treatment of inducing Plagl2, a zinc finger transcription factor gene, and antagonizing Dyrk1a, a gene associated with Down syndrome, referred to as iPaD, can functionally rejuvenate aged neural stem cells (NSCs), thereby enhancing neurogenesis and improving cognition in aged mice. Here, we found that NSC-specific iPaD treatment effectively activated neurogenesis, reduced amyloid-{beta} deposition, and improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed widespread significant changes in gene expression in the hippocampus following iPaD treatment. The upregulated genes included those associated with the activation of astrocytes and microglia involved in amyloid-{beta} clearance, while the downregulated genes included several that are upregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients, but whose roles in disease progression remain unclear. Among the latter genes, knockdown of Prkag2, a gene encoding protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2, in the hippocampus most effectively enhanced neurogenesis and reduced amyloid-{beta} accumulation. Notably, both iPaD treatment and Prkag2 knockdown activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, thereby upregulating genes involved in autophagy and cellular homeostasis. These results suggest that Prkag2 may represent a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Did you see the sound? A Bayesian Perspective on Crossmodal Perception in Low Vision",
    "content": "Multisensory integration is often assumed to increase when visual input is degraded, yet it remains unclear whether low vision enhances susceptibility to cross-modal illusions or whether such effects depend on local variations in visual reliability. We tested low vision and sighted control participants on the Double Flash Illusion across 24 visual-field locations while separately measuring flash-detection accuracy. Both groups showed the expected auditory-driven increase in perceived flash numerosity, but only sighted controls reliably experienced the classic \"double-flash\" percept. Illusion strength did not vary with eccentricity; instead, it was strongly predicted by local flash detection accuracy, indicating that sound-induced percepts depend on the availability of a reliable visual signal. Bayesian Causal Inference modeling revealed substantially weaker and more variable fits for low vision observers, with poorer fits associated with reduced visual sensitivity. Although model parameters did not differ significantly between groups, the similarity in estimated visual noise likely reflects model limitations rather than true equivalence in sensory precision. Together, these findings show that low vision does not globally amplify audiovisual interactions; rather, auditory enhancement depends on local visual reliability, and degraded vision leads to weaker alignment with Bayesian-optimal predictions.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Chronic electroconvulsive shock disrupts hippocampal physiology and impairs associative memory in mice",
    "content": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for depression but it has undesirable side effects on various aspects of cognition, including memory. Patients might display retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events and anterograde amnesia in tests of recall and recognition memory. These amnestic effects are likely to depend, at least in part, on changes in the hippocampus. ECT-induced volume increases in the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus subregion in particular, correlate with the cognitive deficits. However, the precise cellular and behavioral effects of ECT remain poorly understood. Here, we therefore subjected male and female mice to chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and examined effects on hippocampal physiology and memory. Perforant path inputs onto dentate gyrus neurons were examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings in hippocampal slices. In the intact slice, perforant path stimulation did not result in any synaptic or spiking differences in mice given sham vs ECS treatments. However, GABAA blockade increased depolarization and spiking in sham, but not ECS-treated, mice. Voltage clamp recordings further revealed weaker perforant path excitation of dentate gyrus neurons in ECS-treated mice. Extrapolating these findings to the intact animal, we then used Fos expression as a proxy for neural activity, and found that ECS blunted exploration-induced hippocampal activation, which was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus. Finally, recognition memory tasks revealed that ECS impaired memory for object-context associations but not memory for objects or locations. Collectively, these experiments reveal that a clinically relevant schedule of ECS disrupts synaptic and circuit functions of the hippocampus and causes anterograde amnesia in a test of episodic-like associative memory.",

    "title": "Effects of different slow paced breathing regimes on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oscillations",
    "content": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport is crucial for waste clearance and the maintenance of healthy brain function. Various factors, including respiration, have been proposed to drive CSF pulsation. Despite the close relationship between CSF movement and respiration, the impact of different slow respiratory frequencies on CSF oscillations remains unclear. Utilizing a fast neuroimaging technique, we investigated the effects of four different paced respiratory conditions on CSF oscillations. Our findings indicate that all paced respiratory conditions resulted in increased CSF oscillatory power and BOLD global signal amplitude, factors previously associated with increased CSF pulsations. Additionally, we observed that, compared to rest, paced sighing at the 0.02-0.03 Hz frequency range significantly increased the coupling between CSF oscillations and the negative derivative of the BOLD signal. Our study provides a novel perspective on how the frequency of breathing can influence CSF oscillations during wakefulness.",

    "title": "Activation of the medial entorhinal cortex drives memory-guided navigation behavior",
    "content": "The cognitive map in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is essential for spatial memory and exhibits experience-dependent changes. Yet, it remains unclear whether MEC activation is sufficient to drive memory-guided navigation, precluding a causal link between the MEC and spatial memory. To address this gap, we examined and optogenetically manipulated MEC activity as mice navigated a virtual track for a water reward based on memory. During learning, spatial activity in the pre-reward region showed the highest consistency along the track and closely paralleled improvements in reward-predictive behaviors. This elevated pre-reward consistency was widespread across MEC neurons, rather than confined to a particular cell type, indicating a network-level representation supporting reward prediction. Strikingly, optogenetic activation of MEC at non-reward locations biased reward-predictive behaviors toward stimulation sites, but only when stimulation patterns were spatially consistent. Consistent stimulation also induced anticipatory reward-seeking before stimulation onset and this behavior gradually developed with repeated stimulation, reflecting memory formation for stimulation locations. Moreover, in animals that failed to learn the track well, consistent pre-reward activation, alone or combined with landmark activation, significantly enhanced their reward prediction. Thus, spatially consistent MEC activation underlies memory-guided reward prediction, supporting a causal role for the MEC in spatial memory.",

    "title": "Organelle distribution and protein translation defects in radial glia cells with mutations in Eml1",
    "content": "Cerebral cortical development is a finely regulated process, depending on neuronal progenitors, giving rise to post-mitotic neurons that migrate to superficial regions in the developing brain. Disruptions can give rise to cortical malformations, associated with intellectual disability and intractable epilepsy. Mutations in EML1/Eml1, coding for a microtubule-associated protein, lead to subcortical heterotopia in humans and mice. In developing mutant mouse brains, ectopic apical radial glia (aRG) progenitors were found outside the proliferative ventricular zone. The role of Eml1 in aRG is not precisely determined. Using proteomics and imaging approaches, we compared brain tissue from control and mutant mice and identified microtubule and organelle dysregulation. Eml1 influences the trafficking of organelles to different compartments of aRG, where they may be involved in local functions. Mitochondrial and polysome distribution are altered in mutant conditions. Indeed, Eml1 interacts with translational machinery, and downregulation of translation is observed in Eml1 mutant aRG translatome. Paradoxically, an upregulation of translation-related mRNAs is also observed. These data uncover an unprecedented function of Eml1 and associate novel subcellular mechanisms with severe heterotopia formation.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

    "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

    "content": "Clinical trials suggest that a single dose of psilocybin is an effective treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). Choice impulsivity is a value-based decision-making bias that predicts drug-intake escalation and is commonly associated with SUDs. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regulates choice impulsivity and is enriched with 5-HT2A receptors that mediate effects of psilocybin. We hypothesized that psilocybin has long-term ([&ge;]48 hours) effects on choice impulsivity in association with dmPFC inhibitory interneurons with perineuronal nets (PNNs). Male Long Evans rats were trained in a delay discounting task (DDT) where rats chose between delayed large rewards (LR) and immediate small rewards (SR). 48 hours after psilocybin or vehicle injections, DDT was assessed, and rats brains processed for microscopy analysis of extracellular matrix (PNNs) together with inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and c-fos as a marker of neuronal activity. Psilocybin acutely increased head-twitch responses. Psilocybin decreased LR choices and increased the latency to LR choices 48 hours after administration. These effects were independent of delay and therefore not consistent with changes in impulsivity. Psilocybin also increased the density of PNN+PV+cFos triple-labeled neurons in the dmPFC. These results suggest that psilocybin decreases reward seeking through the increased activation of dmPFC PV interneurons with PNNs.",

    "title": "Dopamine drives a positive reward bias on human reinforcement learning",
    "content": "Formal theories of reinforcement learning (RL) prescribe a clearly defined function for dopamine: modulating learning via reward prediction errors (RPEs). Yet, empirical evidence in humans remains scarce, and recent advances introducing noisy RL cast doubt on a simple one-to-one mapping be-tween neurotransmitters and computational mechanisms. Here, we conducted a double-blind, pla-cebo-controlled, randomised pharmacological study using the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, while healthy volunteers performed a volatile two-armed bandit task. Behaviourally, L-DOPA decreased switching following below-average rewards. Algorithmic RL modelling of human behaviour supports a dual effect of L-DOPA on the rate and precision of learning. By leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as implementational models of RL, we explain this dual RL function through a single infer-ence-time modulation, whereby L-DOPA triggers a positive reward bias at the input of the recurrent layer that implements RL. Our findings highlight a unifying mechanism at the implementation level to explain seemingly disparate algorithmic effects.",

    "title": "Reconstruction of the human nigrostriatal pathway in vitro reveals target-dependent dopamine neuron maturation",
    "content": "The human nigrostriatal pathway, comprising dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) projecting to the dorsolateral striatum, is essential for motor control and selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease (PD). How this circuit assembles during development and how it degenerates under pathological conditions remains poorly understood in a human context and in vitro models capturing its long-range connectivity and spatial organization have been lacking. Here, we introduce the connectoid, a compartmentalized, human stem cell-based model of the nigrostriatal pathway that integrates vMB and striatal organoids within a custom-engineered microfluidic device, confining cell bodies while guiding axonal growth, mimicking the in vivo topography. Functional connectivity was confirmed by retrograde rabies tracing, and optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation, while 6-hydroxydopamine induced selective degeneration of dopamine neurons, recapitulating a key feature of PD. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics revealed that interaction with striatal targets enhances dopaminergic neuron maturation and activates transcriptional programs linked to synaptic signaling. Thus, connectoids uniquely allow spatial segregation of regionalized organoids while preserving long-range communication, providing a scalable and physiologically relevant platform for studying human circuit assembly, selective vulnerability, and therapeutic interventions in PD.",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "SynTEF1 restores the functional disease phenotype of SCA27B in an hiPSC-derived neuronal disease model",
    "content": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia 27B (SCA27B), caused by a deep-intronic GAA-TTC repeat expansion in FGF14, has recently been identified as one of the most frequent genetic ataxias. Yet its underlying disease mechanism remains largely unknown, and disease-modifying treatments targeting upstream disease mechanisms are lacking. Here we hypothesized that (i) SCA27B is caused by transcriptional repression of FGF14, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission strength; (ii) which can be restored by a synthetic elongation transcription factor (Syn-TEF1). We assessed FGF14 mRNA levels by qPCR, and neuronal function by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in network and autaptic cultures of SCA27B patient iPSC-derived NGN2-neurons. Change in all read-outs was then assessed also upon Syn-TEF1 treatment. FGF14 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both heterozygous and biallelic SCA27B patient-derived neurons. This was associated with decreased neuronal excitability and decreased peak current density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Moreover, SCA27B neurons showed reduced synaptic transmission with decreased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes. Treatment with SynTEF1 restored FGF14 mRNA levels, thereby restoring neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These insights into SCA27B pathophysiology and its amelioration by SynTEF1 open new translational avenues for the development of disease-modifying gene-targeted therapies for SCA27B.",

    "title": "A scaffold attachment factor PHM-2 regulates synaptic transmission through SLO-2 potassium channel in C. elegans",
    "content": "Scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins are evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding proteins that are involved in multiple processes of gene expression. These proteins are broadly expressed with particular high expression observed in the nervous system. However, their physiological roles in neurons are largely unclear. Here we show that PHM-2, the sole SAFB ortholog in C. elegans, regulates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions through an effect on SLO-2 potassium channel. We found that phm-2 knockout suppresses a sluggish phenotype of worms expressing a hyperactive SLO-2 channel, greatly reduces SLO-2-mediated neuronal whole-cell currents, and enhances neuromuscular synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that PHM-2 genetically interacts with another DNA/RNA binding protein, HRPU-2/hnRNP U, to control SLO-2 expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These results reveal a novel function of a SAFB protein in regulating neuronal activity, and may help understand the physiological roles of SAFB proteins in the nervous system of other species.",

    "title": "What I learned building \"comfortable\" LED strip lighting",
    "content": "<p>I built a small workspace lighting setup using LED strips and ended up learning more than I expected. On paper it was simple: stick a strip somewhere, add a diffuser, done. In practice, the stuff that mattered wasn\u2019t the spec sheet\u2014it was power delivery, optics, and human perception.<p>A few notes that surprised me:<p>Power planning > \u201cjust buy a bigger PSU.\u201d Long runs behave like distributed loads. Voltage drop shows up as uneven brightness, and on RGB/RGBW it can show up as color shift (\u201cwhite\u201d gets warmer at the far end). The fix isn\u2019t only wattage\u2014it\u2019s where you feed power, wire gauge, and connector losses.<p>Diffusion is not cosmetic. Without enough distance or diffusion, you get hotspots and glare. A cheap milky diffuser in an aluminum channel gets you most of the way there, but what helped the most was increasing LED-to-diffuser distance (depth of the channel) rather than chasing \u201cpremium\u201d diffusers.<p>Indirect beats direct for comfort. Bouncing light off a wall/desk surface looked dimmer on paper but felt more usable and less fatiguing. It also hid the fact that LEDs are point sources.<p>Signal integrity is a separate problem (for addressable). A lot of \u201cflicker\u201d is actually data/ground/reference issues, not power. Short data lines, solid ground, and sometimes level shifting helped more than swapping power supplies.<p>Questions for folks who\u2019ve done larger installs (10\u201350m) or more \u201cproduction\u201d setups:<p>Do you design power delivery first or physical layout first?<p>Any favorite diffuser/channel profiles that minimize hotspots without killing too much output?<p>For long addressable runs, what\u2019s your go-to strategy for signal conditioning (buffers, differential, etc.)?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46390875\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46390875</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "A Theory of Thalamocortical Loops in Evidence Accumulation and Decision-Making",
    "content": "A prominent property of the neocortex is that it forms reciprocal excitatory loops with the thalamus. Here, we propose a function for the loops between layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons in the cortex and matrix-type relay cells in the thalamus, which is based on known anatomy and biophysics. This pathway forms an amplifier circuit with a gain less than unity in the resting condition. However, descending cortical input to apical tufts of L5 neurons can raise the gain of these neurons, boosting the thalamocortical loop into either an integrating or an amplifying regime. Multiple thalamocortical loops compete via lateral inhibition in the thalamus, resulting in a winner-take-all global dynamic among the motor commands encoded by each loop. When L5 neurons are driven by sensory inputs, the integration regime closely resembles the drift-diffusion model of decision-making. We explore basic relationships among parameters of this model and compare broadly against neurophysiological data.",

    "title": "An auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans sensitive to fast temporal cues",
    "content": "Rapid threat processing is crucial for survival. In vision, neural models of emotion propose the existence of direct pathways, or \"low roads\", from visual thalamus to the amygdala, which may rely on magnocellular inputs and thereby enable rapid processing of threat signals. In audition, evidence from non-human animals points to the existence of a similar fast direct pathway, but its presence in humans remains unknown. Building on animal evidence that high-rate amplitude-modulated (highAM) sounds preferentially engage magnocellular processing, we used behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging measures to search for an auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans responsive to magnocellular-associated features. Specifically, we tested whether highAM threat cues elicit rapid affective responses, and whether highAM threat processing aligns with structural thalamo-amygdala connectivity. We recorded electroencephalography and pupillometry from participants while they detected voices during fear conditioning. Emotional voices presented at highAM rates, as opposed to lowAM, elicited threat-related responses during the earliest post-stimulus window. A further study combining functional and diffusion-weighted imaging revealed that selective amygdala responses to highAM threatening voices were functionally associated with individual fiber density of an auditory thalamo-amygdala pathway. These results provide convergent functional and anatomical evidence supporting a subcortical pathway for auditory threat processing, consistent with evolutionarily conserved emotional systems.",

    "title": "Conditional-longitudinal brain growth charts detect MRI changes with birth weight and psychopathology",
    "content": "Key Points: Question: How do differences in brain maturation trajectories, quantified by novel conditional-longitudinal models, relate to perinatal factors and mental health in adolescence? Findings: In this longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, conditional-longitudinal normative models revealed that trajectories of brain maturation in adolescence are associated with birth weight, and with longitudinal changes in mental health. Meaning: Conditional-longitudinal models detect inter-individual variability in brain maturation, which is related to both perinatal factors and concurrent changes in psychopathology. Importance: Brain maturation varies between individuals, particularly during dynamic developmental periods like adolescence. Directly assessing differences in longitudinal trajectories can reveal deviations from normative patterns. Objective: We present novel conditional-longitudinal normative models that characterize variability in brain maturation. We utilize these models to examine whether differences in longitudinal trajectories are associated with birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and longitudinal psychopathology scores derived from behavioral assessments. Design: Cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal normative models were developed for brain volumes derived from the first two neuroimaging timepoints from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Conditional-longitudinal models index an individual's expected brain volume at follow-up, conditioned on their baseline measurement. Models were fit with split-half cross-validation on demographically matched samples. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site, population-based, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: Participants were excluded based on imaging quality flags and missing data, leaving 10,830 at baseline and 7,262 at follow-up. Exposures: BW and GA were derived from parent-report questionnaires. General psychopathology scores were calculated using a bifactor model. Main Outcomes and Measures: We calculated cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal centiles, respectively quantifying individual deviations in size and change between timepoints. Sensitivity analyses included covariates for parental income and education as well as current weight and height. Results: The sample was 10,830 at baseline (48.2% F, age 9-10y) and 7,262 at follow-up (46.6% F, age 11-13y). Conditional-longitudinal centiles were sensitive to individual differences in brain change between timepoints. Lower BW was associated with lower conditional-longitudinal centiles, suggesting larger decreases in brain volumes over time (27 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.08). Lower conditional-longitudinal centiles were associated with greater increases in psychopathology scores, suggesting with increased psychopathology brain volumes show greater decrease (37 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.06). Notably, changes in psychopathology were not related to brain size at either timepoint, indexed by cross-sectional centiles. Conclusions and Relevance: Models that capture individual-level deviations from expected growth trajectories, rather than static positions on a growth curve, are particularly informative for assessing developmental change. Novel conditional-longitudinal models address this gap in lifespan brain imaging. Using this framework, we demonstrate robust associations between individual trajectory deviations, perinatal adversity, and longitudinally assessed mental health symptoms. Conditional-longitudinal models hold promise for applications across psychiatric neuroscience, from development to aging.",

    "content": "Visually guided behavior requires transforming sensory inputs into decisions based on behavioral goals. Inferotemporal cortex (IT) is traditionally seen as a perceptual stage that provides object representations for downstream decision circuits. Here, we show that neurons in anterior IT (area TEa) reflect core elements of decision formation. Using a face categorization task with stochastic visual features, we disentangled momentary evidence, accumulated evidence, and choice commitment in the same neural population. TEa neurons integrated task-relevant features over time, suppressed responses after commitment, and dynamically filtered relevant from irrelevant inputs. These are hallmarks of bounded evidence accumulation, typically attributed to frontoparietal regions. Unlike frontoparietal regions, TEa encoded the decision variable in a novel format -as a running average- enabling signal-to-noise ratio improvements without ramping. These findings challenge the view of IT as a passive perceptual buffer, positioning TEa as a decision-aware hub that transforms visual inputs to support flexible, goal-directed behavior.",

    "content": "Rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal excitability, called neural oscillations, pervade brain activity. If these oscillations have a functional role in behavior, they should also be expressed in a behavioral signature. However, identifying such a behavioral signature has remained controversial: evidence for behavioral oscillations is not yet firmly established, and aperiodic components can be misidentified as rhythmic. To test their existence while controlling for aperiodic dynamics, we applied a state-of-the-art autoregressive (AR) approach on two datasets: one published dataset, and a new dataset collected with a revised dense-sampling design. In both datasets, AR modeling recovered reliable behavioral oscillations in the theta band. Reanalyses of the published dataset also reproduced the reported theta shift with task demands, with more difficult tasks showing slower theta. In contrast, despite clear rhythmicity, the new dataset showed no consistent frequency shift across conditions. Overall, this study establishes rigorous and robust detection of behavioral oscillations. It also suggests that the frequency modulation of behavioral oscillations by task difficulty requires further study.",

    "title": "Optimal parameters for measuring multiband auditory brainstem responses to continuous speech",
    "content": "Accurate clinical hearing assessment depends on efficient, engaging measures designed to evaluate ecologically relevant stimuli. Often brief tones or narrowband noise stimuli are used, providing a useful but limited snapshot of hearing function. Including dynamic speech offers a means to capture how the hearing system encodes complex sounds critical for everyday communication. Here we describe the optimal parameters for using audiobook continuous speech with the multiband peaky speech paradigm to measure frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to standard audiological octave bands from 500-8000 Hz in each ear simultaneously. Using computational modeling and direct human ABR testing in adults with normal hearing, we demonstrate that continuous speech signals with a chirp phase profile and fundamental frequency (f0) lowered to the range of 90-110 Hz evoke the largest ABR wave V amplitudes. This amplitude boost occurs when any narrator's f0 is lowered to this optimal range, but the largest responses occur for narrators with original f0s below 170 Hz. We also confirmed that different narrator speech stimuli with these optimized parameters can evoke similarly sized ABRs, but some minor differences remain for testing time. Ultimately, optimizing phase-f0 parameters substantially sped up the median testing time to obtain robust audiobook-based multiband ABRs to within 14 minutes, thereby making this paradigm more feasible for future research and clinical translation.",

In MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS), we identify a conserved correlation between mitochondrial function and purine metabolism that is disrupted across human, organoid, and mouse models. Multiomics integration reveals Complex III as the focal point of mitochondrial collapse, leading to redox stress, DNA damage, and hyperactivation of the de novo purine biosynthesis via purinosome assembly. The breakdown of mitochondria-purinosome coupling compromises genome stability, impairs radial glia proliferation, and delays neuronal maturation. By linking a defined genetic dosage imbalance to metabolic network failure, our study positions the mitochondria-purinosome coordination as a fundamental control axis for neurodevelopment and a therapeutic entry point across metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "title": "The sense of agency in near and far space: where do we stand?",
    "content": "Modern technology frequently places the consequences of our actions at a distance (e.g., remote surgery, smart-home control, virtual reality). Does spatial distance between an action and its outcome weaken the sense of agency (SoA) - the feeling of control over one's actions and consequences? Two recent studies answered \"yes\", reporting stronger temporal binding (TB) in near than far space and interpreting this as greater implicit agency (Jenkins & Obhi, 2021; Mariano et al., 2024). A third study - our own work with a similar paradigm - found no distance effect (Kong et al., 2024). Here we (i) provide a rigorous side-by-side methodological comparison of the three studies, (ii) argue why a direct test to establish a distance modulation of TB (the Near - Far difference of the Active - Passive delta) should be performed in order to reach meaningful conclusions, and (iii) report new re-analyses of our data and direct tests on the two target studies. Overall, current evidence does not support a distance effect on SoA. Our reassessment provides alternative explanations that converge with available evidence suggesting that distance may influence temporal interval perception, but that effect is independent of action intention and therefore of agency.",

    "title": "Kv1.3 inhibition alleviates neuropathology via neuroinflammatory and resilience pathways in a mouse model of A\u03b2 pathology",
    "content": "Inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a therapeutic strategy to curb microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration, although the cellular and signaling mechanisms of disease-modification by Kv1.3 blockers are unclear. In this study, we delineate protective mechanisms of Kv1.3 blockade in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology using comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics profiling of brain, corresponding with neuropathological effects of two translationally relevant Kv1.3 blockers, namely small molecule PAP-1 and peptide ShK-223. Following 3 months of treatment, both molecules reduced Ab plaque burden. Single nuclear RNA seq (snRNA seq) of brain nuclei showed that PAP-1 disproportionately impacted oligodendrocytes and microglia and increased crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes with endothelial cells. In contrast, ShK-223 had pronounced effects on glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Both blockers increased expression of myelination genes in oligodendrocytes and synaptic genes in neurons. Neuroprotective effects of PAP-1 were further confirmed by bulk brain transcriptomics and proteomics whereby PAP-1 increased levels of synaptic, cognitive resilience and mitochondrial proteins, while decreasing glial and immune pathways including STAT1/3 phosphorylation. Using proximity labeling and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT1/3 in microglia. Using microglial cell lines and primary microglia, we discovered a preferential functional coupling between Kv1.3 and type 2 but not type 1 IFN signaling. Brain-level disease modification by Kv1.3 blockade was reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via reduced levels of neurofilament-light (NEFL) and resilience protein RPH3A, both of which are increased in human AD CSF. Together, this study demonstrates functional links between Kv1.3 channels and type 2 IFN signaling and reveals distinct cellular effects of Kv1.3 blockers in AD pathology that correspond with reduced neuropathology and neuroinflammation, augmentation of resilience and neuro-vascular pathways, along with biomarkers of therapeutic effect.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Semi-Markov Smooth Models of Latent Neural States",
    "content": "Hidden (semi-) Markov Models (HsMMs) are increasingly being used to segment neurophysiological signals into sequences of latent cognitive processes. The idea: different processes will leave distinct traces in trial-level recordings of (multivariate) neuro-physiological signals. Markov models, equipped with an emission model of these traces and a latent process model describing the progression through the different latent processes involved in a task, can then be used to infer the most likely process for any time-point and trial. However, the currently used HsMMs remain limited in two important ways. First, they cannot account for subject-level heterogeneity in the latent and emission process. Instead, a single group-level model is assumed to explain the entire data. Second, they cannot account for the potentially nonlinear effects of experimental covariates on the latent and emission process. To address these problems, we present a modeling framework in which the HsMM parameters of the emission and latent process are replaced with mixed additive models, including smooth functions of experimental covariates and random effects. We derive all necessary quantities for empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian inference for all parameters and provide a Python implementation of all estimation algorithms. To demonstrate the advantages offered by this framework, we apply such a multi-level model to an existing lexical decision dataset. We show that, even in such a simple task, not all subjects rely on the same processes equally and that at least two semi-Markov states, previously believed to reflect distinct processes, might actually relate to the same cognitive process.",

    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Portable quantum-sensor magnetomyography decodes fine hand movements",
    "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact quantum sensors that can measure the magnetic fields generated by muscle activity (magnetomyography, MMG) without skin contact. This contact-free alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) has remained mostly confined to magnetically shielded rooms and simple tasks, limiting translation. Here, we show that a portable OPM-MMG system operated inside a compact magnetic shield can robustly decode fine finger movements and recover EMG-like muscle activation patterns. Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design. Our results show that OPM-MMG in a portable shielded environment preserves task-relevant neuromuscular information and approaches EMG-level structure without skin contact or a magnetically shielded room. Our findings open a path toward hygienic, rapid-setup assessment and human-machine interfacing in clinics and rehabilitation settings.",

    "content": "Brainstem arousal systems, especially the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond transiently to behaviorally relevant events, which is reflected in pupil dilations. The strength of these pupil-linked arousal responses during encoding of stimulus material predicts the success of its later retrieval. The pupil also dilates in response to task-irrelevant sounds. Here, we evaluated whether the effect of task-irrelevant white noise sounds on pupil-linked arousal can also be used to manipulate memory formation. Task-irrelevant white-noise sounds played before, during or after the presentation of memoranda (images or spoken words) evoked robust pupil dilations. Trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude of pupil responses during word encoding also predicted memory success. Yet, the task-irrelevant sounds did not increase memory success. These sounds may not trigger the same central arousal processes as endogenous variations of arousal that are relevant for memory formation, such as those occurring in states of increased emotionality.",

    "content": "Anesthesia is a common clinical procedure, yet its hallmark EEG motifs--spindles oscillating in the broad alpha-range between 4 and 16 Hz--are not enough interpretable from the neuronal circuit perspective and for predictive medicine. To fill this gap, we investigate here the neuronal mechanisms and mathematical principles of brain spindles by recording and modeling large-scale thalamo-cortical neuronal ensembles in mice under anesthesia. We report irregular weakly synchronized firing of thalamic and cortical neurons associated with spindle patterns, indicating an emergent network rather than cellular dynamics. The consecutive loss of balance between the firing of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons and the increased firing fluctuations, together play in favor of larger spindle amplitude. In addition, the continuous range of spindle frequencies observed reflects a tight equilibrium of interactions between the thalamus and cortex. To create a possible numerical twin of this complex dynamics that could be used during clinical anesthesia, we built a computational model that comprises a reciprocally connected excitatory and inhibitory representation of cortical and thalamic networks driven by random fluctuations. The model parsimoniously explains the changes in spindle dynamics when increasing the anesthesia dose. This model thus links in vivo brain sub-network dynamics with EEG for the readout of anesthetized brain states.",

    "title": "Empathy Accelerates Subjective Time Perception, Independent of Physiology but Not of Visual Attention",
    "content": "Recent work suggests that empathic engagement can influence cognitive and perceptual processes, yet its impact on time perception remains unclear. Whereas internal clock models would predict that empathy-induced physiological arousal lengthen perceived duration, other frameworks offer opposite predictions. Specifically, findings that empathy reduces perceived distance, combined with construal level, and motivational dimensional theory, together predict that empathy accelerate the subjective passage of time. Moreover, although eye-movements are crucial in empathy, it remains unclear how visual attention modulates time perception during empathic experiences. Thus, we employed an empathy-for-pain and duration estimation task, while measuring participants heart rate, skin conductance, and eye-movements, to investigate how empathy and physiological arousal influence time perception. Our findings show that empathy leads to a faster perceived passage of time. Despite increases in physiological arousal during empathy, arousal was not associated with changes in time perception. Instead, greater visual attention to the eyes predicted stronger temporal contraction. Furthermore, trait empathy and autism quotient were related to this effect, whereas alexithymia was not. These results provide the first empirical evidence that empathy alters time perception, elucidate the contribution of physiological and visual mechanisms to this phenomenon and extend current theories of time perception and empathy.",

    "content": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) relay visual information to the brain, and their functional properties are crucial for visually guided behavior. However, functional maturation of RGCs across development remains elusive. Here, we investigated the developmental maturation of a genetically defined RGC subtype expressing Satb2 in zebrafish, which allowed single-layer-resolved analysis of the tectal neuropil. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized visual response properties of Satb2-positive RGC axon terminals at two developmental stages. At the early stage, responses segregated into seven functional clusters with diverse tuning profiles. By later stage, these responses reorganized into five clusters, indicating developmental restructuring of functional identities. Longitudinal imaging of individual RGC axons revealed that while some response types remain stable across development, others exhibit pronounced plasticity. In particular, certain RGC cluster acquired additional tuning features and converged into motion-sensitive cluster, coinciding with a marked expansion of motion-responsive cluster and reflecting progressive functional specialization. Visual deprivation experiments revealed that core visual tuning is genetically determined, whereas visual experience is crucial for fine-tuning of the particular functional subtype. Together, our findings provide a single-cell-resolved view of retinal circuit maturation and reveal how stable and flexible responses are integrated during the development of vertebrate vision.",

    "title": "Stimulus sensitivity in noisy neural systems",
    "content": "Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information requires a precise definition of neuronal sensitivity to stimuli. While tuning curves and firing rates offer intuitive insights, theoretical frameworks based on signal-to-noise ratio and decoding efficiency identify Fisher information as the canonical measure of sensitivity, due to its relation with decoding performance. However, this relation holds only under restrictive conditions--when many neurons encode the same stimulus feature or when neural noise is weak. In realistic settings, such as when complex or high-dimensional stimuli are represented by a small ensemble of neurons, Fisher information becomes ill-defined or misleading. To overcome these limitations, we investigate two complementary information-theoretic quantities--the stimulus-specific information (ISSI) and the local information (Iloc)--and propose them as robust alternatives for quantifying sensitivity. We show that ISSI and Iloc converge with Fisher information when signal to noise is large, yet remain meaningful and interpretable beyond that regime. Importantly, these measures capture distinct aspects of sensitivity: ISSI quantifies how observing a response reduces stimulus uncertainty, whereas Iloc reflects how small stimulus perturbations reshape the systems posterior beliefs. Together, they offer a unifying perspective linking information-theoretic and statistical notions of sensitivity, bridging theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of neural coding.",

To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding.

    "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
    "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "content": "The removal of brain waste is thought to be regulated by the circadian clock and sleep-wake cycle. A meningeal scavenger cell population, called mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs), uptake macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are poised to clear soluble brain waste. Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake. Consistently, muLECs are required for normal recovery after the heightened metabolic demand of a seizure, suggesting that muLEC clearance contributes to both normal and disrupted brain homeostasis.",

    "content": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in working memory (WM) and executive control. Dysregulation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 signaling pathway has been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology due to its impact on neuronal connectivity and dopamine regulation. Using p35 knockout (p35KO) mice, a validated model exhibiting ADHD-like phenotypes, we investigated sex-specific WM performance, neuronal activation patterns, and responses to acute treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or fluoxetine (FLX), administered alone or in combination. Under basal conditions, p35KO mice of both sexes exhibited significant WM impairment in the Y-maze test compared with wild type (WT) counterparts, whereas recognition memory remained intact. Analysis of neuronal activation (c-Fos-IR) 90 minutes after testing revealed region- and sex-dependent alterations. p35KO males showed significantly reduced c-Fos-IR expression in prefrontal cortical regions, while both sexes exhibited increased c-Fos-IR in hippocampal regions. Acute MPH or FLX treatment significantly improved WM in p35KO males, but this benefit was lost with the combined treatment (MPH+FLX). In contrast, p35KO females showed no WM improvement with any treatment. Notably, WT females exhibited a pronounced decline in WM after exposure to MPH, FLX, or their combination, indicating sex-specific pharmacological sensitivity in healthy animals. These findings highlight the critical role of Cdk5/p35 signaling in maintaining the functional balance between prefrontal and hippocampal networks. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological responses in this ADHD model are highly sensitive to both sex and neurobiological background, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in preclinical and translational ADHD research.",

    "content": "Neuromodulators play a key role in determining how an organism processes and responds to sensory cues. Often, different neuromodulators act on the same set of neural circuits to produce diverging behavioral outcomes. In this study, we examined how dopamine and octopamine alter odor-driven neural activity in a peripheral olfactory circuit (the antennal lobe) and thereby alter behavioral responses in an opposing manner. Our results indicate that dopamine suppressed GABAergic local neuron activity during odor stimulation. Releasing the antennal lobe network from inhibition increased the principal neural activity for all odorants and led to nonspecific increases in a behavioral appetitive response. Octopamine, on the other hand, did not alter the GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe but still reduced the odor-evoked principal neural activity and the behavioral responses elicited by all odorants. Thus, both dopamine and octopamine used distinct mechanisms (altering recurrent inhibition vs intrinsic excitability) to mediate opponent changes in odor-evoked neural activity and behavioral outcomes.",

    "title": "Comparative Study of BBB-Targeting AAV Capsids on Central Nervous System Delivery Efficiency",
    "content": "The efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is often limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study systematically evaluated the tissue distribution of three BBB-crossing AAV capsid variants (PHP.eB, CNSRCV300, and BI-hTFR1) following intravenous injection in mice, using either a constitutive promoter (CAG) or a neuron-specific promoter (hSyn) to drive EGFP reporter expression. Compared with AAV9, both PHP.eB and CNSRCV300 demonstrated significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain transduction efficiency. While the use of the hSyn promoter led to reduced transgene expression in the brain compared with the CAG promoter, and substantially decreased visible reporter expression in peripheral organs, viral deposition in the liver could still be detected via immunohistochemistry. Overall, CNSRCV300 exhibited the most favorable balance between brain-targeting efficiency and biosafety, highlighting its potential as a promising delivery vector. In summary, both the capsid and promoter jointly influence AAV-mediated expression in vivo, and although cell type-specific promoters can reduce off-target expression, residual viral deposition in non-target tissues remains a potential safety concern.",

    "title": "Decision revisions modulated by synaptic inhibition in the olfactory bulb facilitate learning",
    "content": "Behavioral responses are preceded by decisions based on perceived sensory evidence. In real life, sensory inputs are often noisy and change incessantly, raising the question of when and how accurate decisions are made. Cognitive flexibility allows us to revise the choices in case of perceptual conflicts, leading to response revisions. This involves switching between available choices or rapidly stopping misconstrued responses. Here, we quantified these erroneous behavioral actions and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. Mice were trained on an olfactory decision-making task wherein they had to distinguish between a rewarded and an unrewarded stimulus by responding with a lick or withholding it. While the animals respond by licking for both rewarded and unrewarded odor stimuli at the initial stages of learning, the responses almost disappear for the unrewarded ones in the learned stage. However, animals tend to initiate lick responses and stop within a few milliseconds for a few unrewarded trials, even when accuracy levels are high. We describe this phenomenon as decision revisions (DR), and observed it in 5-25% of trials among high-performance blocks. These revisions were mostly observed within a few hundred milliseconds of stimulation. We observed a significantly higher number of revision trials for binary odor mixture discriminations compared to monomolecular ones. Further, by enhancing inhibitory synaptic signaling in the olfactory bulb through photoactivation of ChR2-expressing GAD65-positive GABAergic interneurons, we observed faster odor discrimination and fewer revision trials. Thus, our findings confirm decision revisions that are stimulus complexity-dependent and the pre-cortical control over such a complex cognitive activity.",

    "content": "The integration of mobile robots into human environments requires that they behave in trustworthy ways. Trust develops through interaction, and erratic movements can easily break it. Previous research examined motion predictability and smoothness separately, but their combined effect remains unclear. We investigated how predictability (consistent versus random) and smoothness (gradual versus abrupt) influence human trust and emotion during collision avoidance in virtual reality. Twenty-six participants encountered a robot across repeated trials. We measured subjective valence, arousal, and trust, along with skin conductance responses. Predictability dominated the results. Consistent robot behavior led to increased trust and positive feelings over time. Conversely, unpredictable behavior kept trust low. Smoothness acted mainly as a moderator for arousal; smooth paths reduced the stress caused by unpredictable moves. We also found that prolonged proximity in gradual movements raised physiological arousal, even if users reported feeling calm. These findings suggest predictability drives social acceptance more than smoothness. In order to promote trust, robot designers should prioritize consistent, learnable behaviors.",

    "title": "Synergistic Effect of Valproate and Constraint Induced Movement Therapy on Functional Recovery Following Ischemic Stroke in Rats: Neuroplasticity and Corticosterone Associated Mechanisms",
    "content": "Most rehabilitation paradigms primarily rely on physical stimuli, but biological enhancers may play a complementary role in optimizing adaptive outcomes. The HDACi (Histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug valproate has shown neuroprotective properties following cerebral ischemia, but how it interacts with rehabilitative training is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the synergistic effect of Valproate (VPA) and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on functional recovery following stroke. We induced cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. VPA (300 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was administered within 3 hours after reperfusion and continued for 7 days, followed by CIMT for another week (6 hours/day). The study revealed a significant increase in total infarction volume in the stroke rats compared to controls on day 7 post-stroke. The behavioral assessments revealed that combined treatment with VPA and CIMT restored the neurological and motor behavior deficits. VPA treatment reduced plasma corticosterone levels and modulated heart rate variability indices in stroke rats, suggesting involvement of neuroendocrine stress responses in post stroke recovery. The electrophysiological findings reveal improved functional connectivity between the penumbral (left) motor cortex and the uninjured motor cortex following combinational treatment. The present study also examined the effects of chronic CIMT and VPA monotherapies and delayed onset CIMT (one week after stroke) on functional recovery following stroke; however, these approaches showed limited efficacy. Thus, the study concludes that VPA, along with rehabilitative training, may represent a novel strategy to improve stroke induced persistent functional deficits.",

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "content": "Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) into amyloid fibrils underlies the pathology of synucleinopathies. Rare familial mutations can modulate a-Syn aggregation and may give rise to distinct fibril conformations linked to disease heterogeneity. The E83Q mutation, identified in a Dementia with Lewy Body disease (DLB) patient with atypical Lewy body distribution, has been shown to accelerate a-Syn aggregation and enhance neuronal seeding, yet its structural basis remains unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure at 3.4 Angstrom resolution of recombinant full-length human a-Syn fibrils harboring the E83Q mutation. The fibrils adopt a double-protofilament architecture with a conserved Greek-key-like core spanning residues 36-99, stabilized by intra- and inter-filament salt bridges. Despite this conserved fold, the E83Q mutation induces a distinct local rearrangement within the hydrophobic region: substitution of Glu83 with Gln reorients residue 83 inward, abolishing solvent exposure and altering interactions with the N-terminal region.

    "title": "Deep learning to overcome human error and bias in electrode position extraction in tDCS-fMRI studies",
    "content": "Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with fMRI enables investigation of stimulation effects, while structural MRI verifies electrode positioning, critical for focal montages where minor misplacements reduce target current dose. Currently, no fully automated methods exist for precise electrode extraction from MRI. We developed an Attention U-Net-based deep learning approach to automate electrode detection in focal tDCS-fMRI studies, using structural pointwise-encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) MRI scans from a multicenter trial (N = 392 images; 1,568 electrodes, https://www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Performance was compared to manual and semi-automated methods for a 3x1 montage (three cathodes around a central anode). The network achieved robust segmentation (Dice Score = 0.76, Hausdorff distance = 36.76 mm), identifying all electrodes in 95% of cases (323/340). These metrics compared network-segmented electrodes to highly accurate, manually segmented electrodes, which are also called \"ground truth\". Linear mixed-effects models on 52 ground truth images showed deep learning outperformed manual and semi-automated methods, aligning best with ground truth. Fully/semi-automated methods comparison of 290 images showed highest agreement (ICC = 0.990, bias = 1.3 mm), while manual extraction exhibited larger biases (-5.77 to -7.06 mm) and systematic errors. The automated approach overcomes manual limitations by improving precision, eliminating human variability and bias, and enabling scalability for large studies. It sets a new standard for electrode verification in focal tDCS, particularly for studies requiring precise localization. The model is open-source, with future refinements discussed",

    "content": "Synaptic architecture underlies neuronal computation, with autophagy serving as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, function and local metabolism. Yet, autophagy dynamics and regulation within intact neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a pH sensitive fluorescence lifetime-based imaging method which allows to monitor autophagy dynamics at the synaptic level with a second-scale temporal resolution in the living mouse brain. This approach allowed us to uncover compartmentalized autophagic activity across soma, dendrites, and axons of layer 2/3 cortical neurons. Notably, we observe experience-dependent modulation of autophagy dynamics with pronounced mobility of autophagic vesicles in apical distal dendrites compared to basal proximal dendritic branches. We identified cell-type specific basal autophagy levels in excitatory, inhibitory, and astrocytic cells in the mouse cortex. Finally, combining this approach with disease associated genetic perturbation uncovers novel in vivo autophagy related phenotypes. Altogether, this approach highlights the spatial and functional complexity of autophagy in the intact mammalian brain and establishes a framework for investigating its role in synaptic regulation during development, plasticity, and aging.",

    "title": "\"Remote and partial clocks expand the circadian neuronal network, driving widespread molecular rhythmicity in Drosophila\"",
    "content": "Circadian clocks orchestrate daily physiology and behavioral rhythms, yet the extent to which cells lacking canonical clock components exhibit robust temporal regulation remains unclear. Here we addressed this question using a two-step strategy. First, we systematically mapped core clock gene expression at single-cell resolution across the Drosophila brain and body. Second, leveraging these data and performing targeted experiments, we uncovered cells that lack most or all canonical clock components yet display strong mRNA rhythms. We found that lamina wide-field neurons show high-amplitude tim mRNA cycling even in constant darkness conditions (DD) despite minimal expression of other clock genes, suggesting a partial or noncanonical oscillator. In addition, C2 and C3 optic lobe neurons, which do not express core clock components, exhibit hundreds of circadian and daily cycling transcripts. Notably, circadian rhythms in C3 neurons coincide with oscillations of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), whereas C2 neurons cycle independently of ARGs, indicating distinct non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. These findings reveal a spectrum of circadian regulation, from autonomous to remote, input-driven rhythms and expand the circadian landscape to include strategies for generating and distributing temporal information across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.",

    "content": "Accurate decisions in natural environments require integrating sensory information across modalities. To determine where and when multisensory signals are integrated within the cortical hierarchy, we trained mice in a visuotactile evidence-accumulation task and used widefield and two-photon calcium imaging together with optogenetic perturbations to map cortical circuits. Mice showed enhanced performance in multisensory trials that matched an additive combination of the total unisensory evidence. Cortical imaging also revealed superadditive multisensory responses in parietal and frontal regions, but visual and tactile evidence was accumulated in distinct regions, with the rostrolateral visual area (RL) being more selective for visual and the frontal medial motor cortex (MM) for tactile inputs. This modality-specific segregation persisted beyond stimulus presentation with convergence into a modality-independent choice emerging only late in the trial in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). Two-photon imaging confirmed that ALM neurons predominantly encoded modality-independent choices with few neurons responding to specific sensory stimuli. Optogenetic inactivation of RL and frontal cortex during the stimulus or choice period further validated their respective roles in sensory evidence accumulation and choice formation. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization in which modality-specific evidence is maintained until late in the decision process, with frontal cortex turning multisensory signals into unified choices.",

However, the pupil is also sensitive to luminance changes, making it difficult to study pupillary signals under natural conditions. Here we used pupillary hippus, a luminance-insensitive measure of high-frequency pupil dynamics while human participants planned naturalistic reaches in virtual reality. We found that hippus is significantly increased during planning compared to both rest and movement execution epoch. This finding shows pupillary dynamics change during motion planning reflecting preparatory processes. Most importantly, we demonstrate the potential of a new pupillometric method to study motion planning in natural conditions.",

    "title": "Endothelial Arf6 sustains capillary electrical signaling and cerebral blood flow through PIP2 regeneration and activation of Kir2.1 channels.",
    "content": "Brain capillaries sense neural activity and direct blood flow to active regions--a process termed neurovascular coupling that underlies activity-dependent increases in local perfusion (functional hyperemia). A key contributor to functional hyperemic responses is the capillary endothelial cell (cEC) inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1) channel, which is activated by neuronal activity-derived extracellular K+ and initiates vasodilatory electrical signals that propagate through the vascular network. Kir2.1 channel function requires continual production of its lipid cofactor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and is compromised in mouse models of cerebral small vessel (cSVD). Although decreased PIP2 availability is a common feature of cSVD, mechanisms underlying PIP2 synthesis remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that Arf6, a small GTPase expressed in cECs that stimulates PIP2 production, is critical for this process. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that inhibiting Arf6 activity progressively decreased cEC Kir2.1 channel activity. This deficit corresponded to loss of capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling in isolated vessels and diminished functional hyperemia in vivo. Exogenously provided PIP2 restored Kir2.1 currents and functional hyperemia after Arf6 inhibition or genetic knockdown. Collectively, our data indicate that cEC Arf6 sustains Kir2.1 activity by maintaining PIP2 levels and demonstrate that diminished PIP2 synthesis is sufficient to impair functional hyperemia. Furthermore, we identify Arf6 as a mechanistic link between PIP2 production and endothelial electrical signaling, highlighting Arf6 as a potential therapeutic target for restoring functional hyperemia.",

    "title": "Central T3 deprivation disturbs cortical cilia formation, oligodendrocyte lineage and neuronal cell-cell-communication in a MCT8/OATP1C1 deficient Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome mouse model",
    "content": "Background: The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare, X-linked human genetic disorder caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), essential for thyroid hormone (TH) transport across the blood-brain-barrier. The resulting central TH deprivation disrupts brain maturation and function, leading to intellectual disability and movement disorders. Cortical development, highly dependent on TH, is particularly affected and contributes significantly to AHDS pathologies. Methods: To elucidate disrupted cortical processes, we conducted single nucleus RNA sequencing in a mouse model engineered to mimic the central TH deficiency characteristic of human AHDS. This murine AHDS model features the concomitant deletion of both MCT8 and OATP1C1, a T4 transporter largely absent in human brain capillaries that in mice plays a role in TH transport. The phenotype of dKO mice bears striking resemblance to the pathologies observed in human AHDS patients. Results: Single nuclei were isolated from the cortex and attached striatum of 21-day old WT and MCT8/OATP1C1 dKO mice and sequenced using the 10x Genomics workflow. Cell proportion analyses on the resulting 48 clusters suggested elevated numbers of GABAergic striatal D1 and D2 neurons in the dKO mice. Diminished levels of mature oligodendrocytes coincided with a bifurcation within the oligodendrocyte lineage trajectory, leading to distinct subpopulations of WT and dKO oligodendrocytes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) patterns align poorly with Slc16a2 and Slco1c1 mRNA levels in the respective clusters, but closely with prior published cortical bulk RNAseq data of mice with systemic hypothyroidism or MCT8/OATP1C1 deficiency. These parallels confirm the reliability of our data and provide new insights by pinpointing TH-responsive DEGs to specific cellular clusters. Moreover, inferred cell-cell communication using NeuronChat suggested a disbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic signaling. We further uncovered perturbed primary cilia formation in several GABAergic and glutamatergic clusters of the dKO cortex. Discussion: Molecular signatures and perturbations uncovered by our snRNAseq study reveal new molecular characteristics of the AHDS. The imbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic cell-cell-communication, perturbed primary cilia formation, and bifurcation of the oligodendrocyte lineage align with pathologies observed in AHDS patients and highlight the role of TH signaling in maintaining neuronal network homeostasis in the cortex.",

    "content": "Perception unfolds over time, but whether continuous sounds are sampled with uniform sensitivity is unknown. We combine human psychophysics, EEG and rodent neurophysiology to show that local auditory change detection is strongly gated by stimulus boundaries. In humans, brief perturbations inserted at different temporal positions within 0.5-1-s tones revealed an inverted U-shaped sensitivity profile: detection was attenuated near sound onset and offset and maximal mid-epoch, with EEG change responses showing a closely matching dependence on change timing. Electrocorticography in awake rats exhibited homologous temporal weighting, and analogous profiles for amplitude changes and visual motion demonstrated cross-feature and cross-modal generality. To uncover circuit mechanisms, we recorded single units along the inferior colliculus-medial geniculate body-auditory cortex pathway together with laminar local field potentials in A1. Onset-locked suppression of change responses emerged in midbrain and was progressively amplified in thalamus and cortex, whereas the full start-end profile was expressed in granular-layer alpha-gamma power. A simple biophysically grounded model in which onset responses saturate and cortical populations integrate over finite temporal windows recapitulates this pattern, explaining how stimulus boundaries disrupt prospective and retrospective integration and thereby degrade change detection near the beginning and end of sounds.",

However, accessing distributed neural circuits in mammalian brain regions remains a significant challenge. While fiber photometry is a versatile optical approach, existing methods often suffer from invasiveness and scalability. Here we present an affordable multi-fiber array (MFA)-based photometry system to monitor neural signals across multiple regions. Our system comprises a custom-designed MFA utilizing 50-m diameter optical fibers and off-the-shelf optical components. To demonstrate the system's versatility, we monitored GABAergic population activity using jGCaMP8s across multiple brain regions in head-fixed, awake mice. By combining with pupillometry, we identified state-dependent, region-specific GABAergic dynamics. Our MFA-based photometry system opens new avenues for investigating state-dependent neural dynamics at the mesoscopic level.

    "title": "Introducing a translationally relevant mouse model of radiosurgery-induced unilateral hearing loss",
    "content": "Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely used to treat vestibular schwannomas but may cause irreversible hearing loss due to cochlear toxicity. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and no effective otoprotective therapies exist. We aimed to establish a mouse model that replicates the clinical pattern of radiation-induced hearing loss. Methods: C57BL/6J mice (n=31) received 8Gy (n=3), 16Gy (n=5), 24Gy (n=8), or 32Gy (n=15) using the Leksell Gamma Knife ICON system. Targeting was based on the built-in cone-beam CT, co-registered with MRI and CT-based mouse atlases, to guide unilateral cochlea targeting. A single isocenter was placed lateral to the right cochlea, with the 80% isodose line traversing its medial edge. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks post-SRS. A 32Gy subgroup (n=7) was evaluated at 16 weeks. Histological analysis of cochleae was performed at 4 weeks in all groups and at 16 weeks in the long-term 32Gy group. Results: SRS was well tolerated, and the contralateral cochlea received a very low radiation dose. No ABR shifts were observed at 8 or 16Gy, with only minimal histological changes. At 32Gy, ABR threshold shifts at 22.6 and 32kHz were evident by week1 and worsened by week4. Similar but milder effects occurred at 24Gy. In the 32Gy long-term subgroup, hearing loss progressed across all frequencies, most severely at high frequencies, alongside a sustained wave I amplitude decline. At 32 Gy, outer hair cells were reduced by 14% and 44% at 32 and 45.2 kHz, respectively, at 4 weeks, and by 38% and 80% at 16 weeks. Ribbon synapses were mildly reduced at 4 weeks and more markedly at 16 weeks in corresponding high-frequency regions. Spiral ganglion neuron density was mildly reduced at the basal and middle turns. All reported changes were statistically significant when compared to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: This new model reproduces key features of SRS-induced cochlear toxicity, including unilateral, dose-dependent, and progressive hearing loss. It thus provides a valuable platform for investigating mechanisms and testing otoprotective strategies.",

    "title": "Rapid fluorescence lifetime sensor development of LifeCamp enables transient and baseline absolute calcium measurements",
    "content": "Genetically encoded calcium sensors (GECIs) have been instrumental for studying neuronal activity and intracellular signaling. GECIs are typically fluorescence-intensity sensors that change brightness upon calcium binding. Iterative improvements in GECIs have yielded indicators that report action potential-evoked calcium entry with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, enabling measurement of network activity across thousands of neurons. However, fluorescence intensity-based measurements generally cannot report baseline or absolute calcium levels and may confound neuromodulatory regulation of calcium handling with changes in action potential firing. Fluorescence lifetime sensors are insensitive to many artifacts that plague intensity-based measures and report absolute substrate levels, including those at rest. However, relatively few lifetime sensors for neuronal signals exist, and developing new sensors is typically difficult and low-yield. Here, we introduce a new rapid lifetime sensor development (RALISED) platform, which we use to build a new GCaMP8m-based high-speed lifetime calcium sensor, termed LifeCamp. We show that LifeCamp enables comparison of baseline calcium signals in cell culture, brain slices, and mice. In addition, we show that LifeCamp enables the detection of fast action potential-evoked calcium transients in single neurons from brain slices and in behaving mice. Using LifeCamp, we discovered calcium baseline changes associated with neuronal activity in brain slices and behaving mice, as well as slow average calcium changes in neuronal populations of freely moving mice. Altogether, this study highlights the utility of the RALISED method to rapidly develop new lifetime sensors and the application of the LifeCamp calcium lifetime sensor to study fast and slow calcium signaling.",

    "title": "Timing matters: exon skipping therapy is most effective when initiated early in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
    "content": "Exon skipping is a leading therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive muscle wasting disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene that typically disrupt the translation reading frame. This approach aims to modulate DMD pre-mRNA splicing to re-frame the transcript and generate an internally deleted but partially functional quasi-dystrophin protein. Four exon skipping drugs have received FDA accelerated approval, although their clinical efficacy is very limited. To investigate how treatment timing influences exon skipping outcomes, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were injected with peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PPMO) exon skipping conjugates beginning at either the adult (12-week) or aged (75-week) stages, and tibialis anterior muscles harvested for biochemical and transcriptomic analyses. Mean Dmd exon 23 skipping was 79% in adults and 44% in aged PPMO-treated mdx mice, whereas dystrophin protein restoration was 35% and 8%, respectively. Histopathological improvements were only evident in the adult-treated mice. PPMO-treatment in adult mdx mice induced a broad transcriptomic shift towards a wild-type signature, whereas treatment in aged mice resulted in negligible gene expression changes, indicating that late intervention is ineffective at reversing disease-associated pathologies despite low-level dystrophin restoration. Dystrophin transcript imbalance was corrected only in adult-treated mdx mice. Increased expression of the dystrophin-repressing microRNA miR-31-5p, which was more strongly upregulated in aged mdx muscle, provides a potential mechanistic explanation. In conclusion, PPMO-mediated exon skipping is substantially more effective when initiated in adult rather than aged dystrophic muscle, supporting early therapeutic intervention in DMD-affected individuals.",

Using chronic social defeat stress, behavioural phenotyping, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped stress-induced transcriptional changes across habenular cell types and lateral habenula (LHb) subregions. Our findings reveal that each behavioural phenotype is marked by its own transcriptional profile. These subregion-specific patterns across the LHb suggest that different cellular circuits contribute uniquely to depressive-like states.",

I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store. </p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong> </p> <p>TidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders. </p> <p><em>The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.</em> </p> <p>This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules. </p> <p>The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.</p> <p>Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool. </p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases. </p> <p>Check out the app at: <a href=\"https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit\">TidyBit GitHub Repository</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swaroop_34\"> /u/swaroop_34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvb83i/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It's now available on PyPI (v0.1.0 - early beta).</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does:</strong></p> <p>typed-pytest is a type-safe mocking library for pytest. When you use MagicMock(MyClass) in pytest, your IDE loses all autocomplete - you can't see the original class methods, and mock assertions like assert_called_once_with() have no type hints.</p> <p>typed-pytest fixes this by providing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Full IDE autocomplete for both original class methods and mock assertion methods</strong></li> <li><strong>Lint-time typo detection - misspelled method names are caught by mypy/pyright before tests run</strong></li> <li><strong>Type-checked mock properties - return_value, side_effect, call_count are properly typed</strong></li> <li><strong>Stub generator CLI - generates project-specific type stubs for your classes</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>from typed_pytest_stubs import typed_mock, UserService mock = typed_mock(UserService) mock.get_usr # \u274c Caught by type checker: &quot;get_usr&quot; is not a known member mock.get_user.assert_called_once_with(1) # \u2705 Autocomplete + type-checked! </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>Python developers who use pytest with mocks and want better IDE support and type safety. Especially useful for those practicing TDD or working with AI coding assistants where fast feedback on syntax errors is important.</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p> <p>The standard unittest.mock.MagicMock provides no type information - your IDE treats everything as Any. Some developers use cast() to recover the original type, but then you lose access to mock-specific methods like assert_called_with().</p> <p>typed-pytest gives you both: original class signatures AND mock method type hints, all with full IDE autocomplete.</p> <p>Check out the project at: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest\">https://github.com/tmdgusya/typed-pytest</a></p> <p><strong>Still early beta - feedback, contributions, and \u2b50 are all appreciated!</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kr_roach\"> /u/kr_roach </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pvbs25/i_built_a_library_that_brings_autocomplete_back/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "title": "Dysregulated Microglial Synaptic Engulfment in Diffuse Midline Glioma",
    "content": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a near-universally lethal form of pediatric high-grade glioma, driven by neuronal activity-regulated paracrine signaling and synaptic integration of malignant cells into neural circuits. In turn, DMG increases neuronal excitability, augmenting neuron-to-glioma signaling. In the healthy brain, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity. However, the role of microglia in promoting tumor-associated hyperexcitable neural networks in glioma remains unknown. Here, we investigate the activity-regulated engulfment of neuronal synapses by microglia in both healthy and glioma-bearing mice, and further explore how glioma cells alter microglia-mediated circuit refinement, contributing to pathogenic neuronal hyperexcitability. Microglia-mediated circuit refinement in the glioma microenvironment was characterized through synaptic engulfment analysis of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses by microglia in healthy mice and patient-derived DMG xenograft models, paired with optogenetic stimulation in the neocortex. We found that glutamatergic neuronal activity in the healthy brain increased excitatory synaptic engulfment by microglia in a previously unappreciated negative feedback mechanism that may guard against hyperexcitability. In contrast, this activity-regulated increase in excitatory synaptic engulfment was abrogated in DMG-infiltrated brains. Instead, inhibitory synaptic engulfment was significantly increased in DMG in response to glutamatergic neuronal activity. Together, these dysregulated synaptic engulfment mechanisms may create imbalance in the excitatory to inhibitory (E:I) synapse ratio predicted to increase neuronal excitability. Complementary single-nuclei sequencing studies revealed concordant tumor-specific, activity-regulated changes in microglia-neuron signaling showing reduced expression of excitatory synaptic refinement gene programs in microglia, potentially mediating the aberrant synaptic engulfment observed in DMG. These findings reveal novel cancer-neuron-immune interactions in DMG and provide an opportunity to potentially modulate tumor-associated neuronal hyperexcitability by targeting aberrant microglial synaptic engulfment.",

    "title": "Longitudinal Resting-State fMRI of Awake Mice During Habituation: Stress, Head Motion, and Functional Connectivity",
    "content": "Awake mouse fMRI is a powerful tool for both neuroscience and translational research. To minimize head motion during scanning, habituation under physical restraint is commonly used. However, it remains unclear how stress levels and head motion evolve during habituation, particularly within the MRI environment. To address this, we repeatedly measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in three groups of mice - controls, mice habituated outside the MRI magnet, and mice habituated within the fMRI environment - and acquired longitudinal resting-state fMRI data daily during an eight-day habituation period and again 15 days post-habituation at 15.2 T. We found that CORT levels initially increased by approximately twofold and gradually decreased during habituation outside the magnet, whereas in mice habituated within the fMRI environment, CORT levels increased two- to fourfold and remained elevated throughout the habituation period. One week after habituation, CORT levels returned to baseline in both groups. Throughout all resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, head motion and functional connectivity remained stable, likely due to the well-designed restraint cradle that permitted paw movement. These results suggest that additional habituation days do not further reduce stress, provided that head motion remains within acceptable limits.",

    "title": "Environmental Conflict Modulates Pavlovian Bias",
    "content": "Pavlovian avoidance enables rapid defensive responding but can undermine goal directed behaviour when it overrides instrumental control, a tendency amplified in anxiety. Whether such biases can be flexibly and rapidly modulated by environmental structure remains unknown. Here we show that global conflict in the environment can suppress Pavlovian avoidance and enhance instrumental choice, particularly in individuals high in trait anxiety. One hundred and sixteen participants completed a sequential approach avoidance task in which three options differed in reward-punishment conflict, and blocks varied the frequency of high conflict encounters. In low conflict environments, participants exhibited pronounced and misplaced avoidance of objectively safe, no conflict options indicating that choices are not determined by local contingencies alone but are tuned to broader environmental context. Interestingly, increasing environmental conflict reduced this maladaptive avoidance: approach to safe options increased, and reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling revealed higher reward sensitivity and drift rates alongside reduced lapse and Pavlovian bias parameters. These effects were strongest in high anxious individuals, whose behaviour shifted markedly toward that of low anxious peers. Crucially, benefits depended on the frequency of conflict encounters and were not elicited by cue outcome reversals or increased punishment probability alone. Furthermore, a modified Go/NoGo task replicated global conflict dependent improvements on Pavlovian incongruent trials. Together, these results demonstrate that global environmental conflict can rapidly recalibrate the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental systems, attenuating maladaptive avoidance and disproportionately aiding anxious individuals. We propose that conflict driven arousal dynamics, plausibly mediated by LC-NE mechanisms, promote this adaptive reconfiguration of defensive and goal directed control.",

    "title": "Image-Based Profiling of Induced Trophoblast Stem Cells Identifies Signatures Associated with Sex, Schizophrenia Genomic Risk and Placental Stress",
    "content": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder where both genetic and environmental risks converge during pregnancy. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of placental biology in influencing risk of developing SCZ. However, the pathways by which genetic risk factors for SCZ interact with environmental influences to alter placental development are poorly understood. Through image-based profiling using Cell Painting, we leveraged trophoblast cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from male and female SCZ and neurotypical donors with varying placental genomic risk scores (PlacGRS) to explore the developmental dynamics of placental cells under normal growth and hypoxic stress. We employed both classical (e.g., CellProfiler) and deep learning feature extraction combined with downstream supervised machine learning to analyze high-dimensional data obtained from this hiPSC-derived model system, highlighting that these approaches overcome the inherent line-to-line variability in phenotypic analysis. Our findings reveal a salient nucleus-localized SCZ risk signature across cell lines, along with clear sexual dimorphism. This research underscores the capability of hiPSC-derived placenta models to elucidate complex interactions between genetic risk and environmental factors implicated in the neurodevelopment of SCZ, paving the way for future studies aimed at developing targeted therapeutic and prevention strategies.",

    "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that was once hyperendemic in the island of Guam (Mariana Islands, US) and a few other Pacific locales. Despite extensive investigations into its origins, the etiology of ALS/PDC remains unclear. ALS/PDC is, at the neuropathology level, characterized by tau-dominant multiple proteinopathy in brain and spinal cord. It was recently reported that Guam ALS/PDC brain extracts exhibit tau seeding activity in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor cells. To build upon those findings and explore the nature of tau seeds in ALS/PDC in more detail, we used an alanine mutational scanning (Ala scan) approach to determine the seeding profile of tau in nervous tissues of Guam ALS/PDC cases. First, we confirmed the detection of tau seeding activity in ALS/PDC brain samples in tau biosensor cells. Notably, we could also detect potent tau seeding activity in spinal cord. Subsequent Ala scan assays demonstrated that ALS/PDC tau displays an aggregate incorporation pattern that resembles that of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-type tau. This result is consistent with recent electron cryo-microscopy studies of tau, which revealed that ALS/PDC tau filaments are predominantly of the CTE-type. The structural characteristics and seeding behavior of ALS/PDC tau, as well as the regional distribution of tau pathology at post-mortem, suggest that ALS/PDC is a CTE-like tauopathy.",

    "title": "The organization of visual pathways in the Drosophila brain",
    "content": "Visual systems across species transform photoreceptor inputs into diverse perceptual representations through hierarchical networks that extract features via parallel pathways. In Drosophila, the optic lobes are layered, retinotopic visual processing centers that contain two-thirds of the brain's neurons and support diverse visually guided behaviors. Although this architecture has long suggested hierarchical and parallel organization, a system-wide account of how behaviorally relevant visual features are routed and integrated across a complete visual system--in any animal--has remained elusive. The new male fly connectome now provides the synapse-level wiring needed to trace visual information from photoreceptors through the optic lobes and across the central brain. Applying a network-based analysis of information flow, we reveal a multi-layered architecture organized into distinct, functionally interpretable pathways. Using this framework to propagate signals through these pathways predicts receptive-field structure and feature selectivity consistent with physiological data, enabling large-scale functional annotation of thousands of neuron types. We find that distinct visual input channels are broadly distributed throughout the brain, yet converge in focal regions of feature specificity and acute spatial vision. Together, these analyses provide a neuron-level, connectome-based view of how a brain organizes and transforms visual input.",

    "title": "Human and AI voice identities evoke shared neural signatures during speaker recognition across changes in speech content and prosody",
    "content": "Both biologically-produced human voices and algorithmically-generated AI speech manifest speaker identity. Critically, prosodic variations modulate the acoustic dimensions (e.g., fundamental frequency) that also shape individual speaker identity representations. So far it remains unclear whether listeners process speaker identities in human and AI voices through neurologically equivalent mechanisms, nor how prosodic cues might influence these cognitive processes. We examined event-related potentials during old/new speaker discrimination after name-based identity learning, and further analyzed correctly recognized old speakers comparing trials where prosody matched vs. mismatched between learning and testing. For old/new discrimination, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed three significant late windows (662-1498 ms) with Pz as the primary contributor for AI voices, yet none for human voices. Univariate analyses revealed that human voices showed earlier widespread discrimination (N250: 200-280 ms), while both voice types converged on Pz as the strongest contributor based on effect size rankings for late old/new effects (400-800 ms). These old/new effects emerged across completely different speech content between learning and testing, addressing a gap in prior literature. For speaker-specific prosodic expectation effects in the 500-900 ms window, unexpected prosody elicited late positivity for human voices compared to the prosody used during learning, whereas AI voices elicited late negativity. The late positivity resembles P600 components observed for communicative style expectancy violations, while the late negativity likely reflects effortful reprocessing of prosodic violations within atypical synthetic signals, analogous to accented speech processing. Our study advances understanding of voice identity in cognitive neuroscience and offers implications for AI voices in human-computer interaction.",

    "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20847v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20714v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20679v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election unfolded within an information environment of unprecedented volatility, challenging citizens to navigate a torrent of rapidly evolving, often contradictory information while determining what to believe. This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.",

    "title": "Learning Factors in AI-Augmented Education: A Comparative Study of Middle and High School Students",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.21246v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21105v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) represent a novel but underexplored modality for emotion recognition. This paper presents a systematic evidence synthesis and exploratory investigation of VOC-based affective computing using low-cost sensors. Study 1, a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed 16 studies from 610 records across breath, sweat, skin, and urine biosources. Evidence indicates that stress and affective states are reflected in VOC signatures (aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, sulfur compounds), though with considerable heterogeneity. Current research relies predominantly on laboratory-grade GC-MS or PTR-MS, while wearable sensors provide pattern-level outputs without compound-specific identification - a critical gap for practical systems. Study 2 (n=25) investigated whether low-cost TVOC sensors (BME688, ENS160) combined with physiological monitoring (HR, HRV, GSR) can detect laboratory-induced stress. Exploratory analysis revealed that high cardiovascular reactors exhibited elevated TVOC during arithmetic stress (d=1.38), though requiring replication in larger samples. Substantial interindividual variability emerged (CV>80%), with coupling patterns moderated by baseline emission levels and temporal lags of 30-80 seconds. Random Forest-based multimodal classification achieved 77.3% accuracy (5-fold CV). SHAP analysis indicated VOC sensors contributed 24.9% of model performance. Leave-one-subject-out validation yielded 65.3% accuracy, highlighting the need for individual calibration. This work provides three contributions: (1) comprehensive mapping of VOC biomarker evidence and technological gaps, (2) initial demonstration that low-cost sensors can capture stress-related VOC patterns in multimodal fusion, and (3) identification of key implementation challenges. Findings require replication in larger samples (n>=50).",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21041v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With generative artificial intelligence driving the growth of dialogic data in education, automated coding is a promising direction for learning analytics to improve efficiency. This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.",

With a literature review of related works covering various data types and applications, we identify features of medical visualization and visual analysis research and formulate our model thereafter. Compared to previous design study process models, our new model emphasizes: distinguishing between different stakeholders and target users before initiating specific designs, distinguishing design stages according to analytic logic or cognitive habits, and classifying task types as inferential or descriptive, and further hypothesis-based or hypothesis-free based on whether they involve multiple subgroups. In addition, our model refines previous models according to the characteristics of medical problems and provides referable guidance for each step. These improvements make the visualization design targeted, generalizable, and operational, which can adapt to the complexity and diversity of medical problems. We apply this model to guide the design of a visual analysis method and reanalyze three medical visualization-related works. These examples suggest that the new process model can provide a systematic theoretical framework and practical guidance for interdisciplinary medical visualization research. We give recommendations that future researchers can refer to, report on reflections on the model, and delineate it from existing models.",

However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems.

Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.",

Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\\%$ average).

    "content": "arXiv:2507.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.",

    "content": "arXiv:2412.07327v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Computational neuroscience relies on large-scale dynamical-systems models of neurons, with a vast amount of offline, pre-simulation, tuned parameters, with models often tied to their brain simulators. These fixed parameters lead to stiff models, that show unnatural behaviour when introduced to new environments, or when combined into larger networks. In contrast to offline tuning, in biology, cells continuously adapt via homeostatic plasticity to stay in desired dynamical regimes. In this work, we aim to introduce such online tuning of cellular parameters into brain simulation. We show that the sensitivity equation of a biorealistic neural models has the same shape as a general neuron model, and can be simulated within existing brain simulators. Via co-simulation with the sensitivity equation, we enable both offline, and online tuning of activity of arbitrary biophysically realistic brain models. Furthermore, we show that this opens the possibility to study the biological mechanisms underlying homeostatic plasticity, via both meta-learning plasticity mechanism as well as treating online tuning as a black-box plasticity mechanism.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20929v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.",

    "content": "The human body displays slow, spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity, autonomic physiology, and small incidental movements. It is unknown whether these co-fluctuations reflect a stable endogenous brain-body dynamic, or whether this dynamics varies with cognitive state. We addressed this question using a dynamical systems approach to analyze simultaneously recorded neural activity (EEG), autonomic physiology, and behavior while participants listened to spoken narratives or were at rest. We found that cognitive state did not substantially alter the endogenous dynamic. Acoustic and linguistic features predicted neural activity, which in turn affected physiological responses. Only low-level sound fluctuations exerted direct effects on autonomic signals. Peripheral physiology and behavior exerted stronger influences on EEG than the reverse. These findings suggest that slow co-fluctuations are the result of a stable brain-body dynamic with strong bottom-up feedback, and that the narrative entrains this dynamic by engaging cognition.",

    "title": "Corticolimbic structure-function coupling is sensitive to childhood adversity and buffers adversity-related symptoms during development",
    "content": "Childhood adversity is a potent predictor of mental health problems across the lifespan, and a rich cross-species literature implicates stress-sensitive corticolimbic circuits in adversity-related psychopathology. Structure-function coupling (SFC) is a promising multimodal marker that is sensitive to developmental plasticity. While emerging evidence suggests cortical SFC is sensitive to adversity exposure during early childhood, it is unknown how SFC in stress-sensitive corticolimbic circuits links adversity exposure with mental health across development. We examined associations between adversity exposure, transdiagnostic symptomatology, and both amygdala-cortical and hippocampal-cortical SFC across development in a large sample of youth (N = 607, 39% F). Results revealed that adversity exposure moderated age-related change in amygdala-vmPFC SFC (p = .007), such that youth exposed to higher, but not lower, levels of adversity showed an age-related increase in amygdala-vmPFC SFC. Further, amygdala-vmPFC SFC buffered the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .012), such that those youth with higher adversity exposure who had stronger amygdala-vmPFC SFC also displayed lower internalizing symptoms. Separately, higher adversity exposure was associated with lower hippocampal-limbic network SFC (p = .037), which moderated the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .010). These findings highlight that structural and functional neurodevelopment of amygdala-vmPFC and hippocampal-limbic network connections may adapt in distinct ways to support mental health following adversity, with implications for risk and resilience against internalizing psychopathology.",

    "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis.

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Using in vivo fiber photometry in adult mice expressing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, combined with EEG/EMG recordings, we investigated the temporal organization of multiple neuromodulators during sleep in barrel cortex, with norepinephrine (NE) as a reference signal. All five neuromodulators examined, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and NE, exhibited synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations during NREM sleep. Optogenetic suppression of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons abolished NE oscillations and selectively reduced acetylcholine fluctuations in barrel cortex, whereas targeted inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons attenuated REM-associated acetylcholine elevations without disrupting NREM-related oscillations or NE dynamics. The synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations spanning multiple neuromodulators reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for organizing sleep architecture.",

    "content": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are small cells in the central nervous system that proliferate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life, allowing for myelin plasticity and repair. G protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors can regulate OPC fate, but the role of individual G protein families is unclear. Here, we use chemogenetics to directly investigate the role of Gq and Gi proteins in OPC fate. We find that expressing the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) hM3Dq or hM4Di in OPCs without activating them with designer agonists induces constitutive G protein signalling, which alters bioelectrical membrane properties such as voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors in OPCs. Further, we find that hM3Dq or hM4Di expression alone modulates OPC fate, increasing or decreasing differentiation, respectively, suggesting that directly targeting G protein signalling can be used to bidirectionally regulate differentiation. Importantly, our data raise a note of caution regarding the use of DREADDs in both excitable and non-excitable small cells.",

    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "title": "Mesa 3.4.0: Agent-based modeling; now with universal time tracking and improved reproducibility!",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! Mesa 3.4.0 is here with major improvements to time tracking, batch run reproducibility, and a strengthened deprecation policy. We've also migrated to our new mesa organization on GitHub and now require Python 3.12+. This release includes numerous visualization enhancements, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0\"><strong>https://github.com/mesa/mesa/releases/tag/v3.4.0</strong></a></li> </ul> <h1>What's Agent-Based Modeling?</h1> <p>Ever wondered how bird flocks organize themselves? Or how traffic jams form? Agent-based modeling (ABM) lets you simulate these complex systems by defining simple rules for individual &quot;agents&quot; (birds, cars, people, etc.) and then watching how they interact. Instead of writing equations to describe the whole system, you model each agent's behavior and let patterns emerge naturally through their interactions. It's particularly powerful for studying systems where individual decisions and interactions drive collective behavior.</p> <h1>What's Mesa?</h1> <p>Mesa is Python's leading framework for agent-based modeling, providing a comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. It combines Python's scientific stack (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib) with specialized tools for handling spatial relationships, agent scheduling, and data collection. Whether you're studying epidemic spread, market dynamics, or ecological systems, Mesa provides the building blocks to create sophisticated simulations while keeping your code clean and maintainable.</p> <h1>What's new in Mesa 3.4.0?</h1> <h1>Universal simulation time with model.time</h1> <p>Mesa now provides a single source of truth for simulation time through the <code>model.time</code> attribute. Previously, time was fragmented across different components - simple models used <code>model.steps</code> as a proxy, while discrete event simulations stored time in <code>simulator.time</code>. Now all models have a consistent <code>model.time</code> attribute that automatically increments with each step and works seamlessly with discrete event simulators.</p> <p>It also allows us to simplify our data collection and experimentation control in future releases, and better integrate it with our full discrete-event simulation.</p> <h1>Improved batch run reproducibility</h1> <p>The <code>batch_run</code> function now offers explicit control over random seeds across replications through the new <code>rng</code> parameter. Previously, using <code>iterations</code> with a fixed seed caused all iterations to use identical seeds, producing duplicate results instead of independent replications. The new approach gives you complete control over reproducibility by accepting either a single seed value or an iterable of seed values.</p> <h1>Other improvements</h1> <p>This release includes significant visualization enhancements (support for <code>AgentPortrayalStyle</code> in Altair components, improved property layer styling), a strengthened deprecation policy with formal guarantees, removal of the experimental cell space module in favor of the stable <code>mesa.discrete_space</code> module, and numerous bug fixes.</p> <p>We welcome 10 new contributors to the Mesa project in this release! Thank you to everyone who contributed bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature enhancements.</p> <h1>Mesa 4</h1> <p>We're already planning the future with Mesa 4.0, and focusing on two key areas: <strong>Fundamentals</strong> (unified time and event scheduling, coherent spatial modeling, clean-sheet experimentation and data collection, stable visualization) and <strong>Extendability</strong> (powerful agent behavior frameworks, ML/RL/AI integration, and an extensible module system). We aim to make Mesa not just a toolkit but a comprehensive platform where researchers can model complex systems as naturally as they think about them. Join the discussion on <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/discussions/2972\">GitHub</a> to help shape Mesa's future direction.</p> <h1>Talk with us!</h1> <p>We always love to hear what you think:</p> <ul> <li>Join our Matrix chat: <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#project-mesa:matrix.org\"><strong>https://matrix.to/#/#project-mesa:matrix.org</strong></a></li> <li>Checkout our Discussions: <a href=\"https://github.com/mesa/mesa/discussions\"><strong>https://github.com/mesa/mesa/discussions</strong></a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puriem/mesa_340_agentbased_modeling_now_with_universal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puriem/mesa_340_agentbased_modeling_now_with_universal/\">[comments]</a></span>",

As an input it accepts SMILES notation. Chemical syntax validity is enforced during training and inference using SELFIES encoding. I also made an optional GUI to interact with the model using NiceGUI.</p> <p>Currently, it might seem like a glorified substructure search, however it is able to generate molecules which may not actually exist (yet?) while respecting chemical syntax and including the input structure in the generated structure. I have listed some possible use-cases and further improvements in the github README.</p> <h1>Target audience</h1> <ul> <li>People who find it intriguing to generate random, cool, possibly unsynthesisable molecules.</li> <li>Chemists</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I have not found many projects which uses a GRU and have a GUI to interact with the model. Transformers, LSTM are likely better for such uses-cases but may require more data and computational resources, and many projects exist which have demonstrated their capabilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thecrypticcode\"> /u/thecrypticcode </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1puap2b/built_a_molecule_generator_using_pytorch/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Predicting spiking activity from scalp EEG",
    "content": "Objective. Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we aimed to estimate spiking activity in the visual cortex using non-invasive scalp EEG. Approach. We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials. We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Main results. Although the relationship between these spectrotemporal features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, they were reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Significance. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG provides information on underlying spiking activity beyond what is available when only the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.",

    "title": "Adaptive neuromodulation dialogues: navigating current challenges and emerging innovations in neuromodulation system development",
    "content": "Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies. This article represents a synthesis of scientific, engineering, and clinical viewpoints to inform key stakeholders in the neuromodulation and brain-computer interface spaces.",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

    "title": "Numerical Variability of functional MRI Graph Measures",
    "content": "Network neuroscience provides a powerful framework for studying the mechanisms underlying brain-related diseases. As analyses become increasingly computational, ensuring their numerical reliability has become a critical challenge. Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes. NPVR values varied across brain regions, thresholding choices, and confound regression strategies. These findings highlight numerical variability as an important factor in functional network studies, particularly when examining subtle effects or working with small sample sizes.",

    "title": "Cellular- and systems-level profiling of amyloid-beta effects on circadian timing",
    "content": "Disruption of the circadian timing system has been reported in the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD) and is a well-characterized component of mid- and late-stage AD. Given the distributed nature of the circadian timing system, with a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks throughout the brain, understanding how AD affects this system has been challenging. To investigate how AD may disrupt circadian physiology, we focused on the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to familial early-onset AD. Using the 5xFAD mouse model and ex vivo single-cell profiling, we examined how amyloid-beta influences clock timing in both SCN neurons and hippocampal neuronal populations. Circadian profiling of 5xFAD mice (4- and 8-months-old) showed only modest changes in key clock timing properties, including a shortening of the SCN rhythm. Interestingly, the mice showed enhanced rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light cycle, suggesting that elevated amyloid-beta levels increase the sensitivity of the SCN clock to light. Further, using both in vitro SCN slice explant and dispersed SCN culture models, the exogenous administration of oligomerized amyloid-beta had no significant effect on inherent clock timing capacity. In contrast, the timing properties of cultured hippocampal neurons showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to amyloid-beta. This included an elevated mesor and an increased rhythm amplitude. These findings reveal a divergence in amyloid-beta sensitivity between the central SCN clock and peripheral oscillators. This raises the possibility that circadian disruptions in AD may stem from both the destabilization and decoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central timing properties of the SCN.",

    "title": "Deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning",
    "content": "Understanding how cognition shapes behavior across contexts remains a fundamental challenge for many disciplines. In particular, for the optimism heuristic--i.e., the tendency to overweight positive (relative to negative) information--knowledge remains fragmented, with models developed in specific domains in isolation. Here, we present a unifying computational framework by deriving the deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach discretizes reward distributions through a finite set of neurons, consistent with recent empirical findings on distributional coding in the brain. We validate our framework by reproducing established results across three iconic domains spanning individual exploration versus exploitation, social coordination, and risky choice. Beyond validation, we uncover novel interactions among optimism, reward discretization, and temporal discounting. Specifically, we identify conditions under which choice hysteresis and path-dependent strategies emerge, suggesting that perseveration results from neural reward discretization rather than constituting an independent heuristic. We further reveal \"individual dilemmas\": circumstances where agents gravitate toward suboptimal yet stable strategies, offering a mechanistic explanation for incoherent choice patterns. Our framework bridges neuroscience, psychology, and collective behavior, enabling empirically testable hypotheses about how cognitive biases propagate from individual cognition to social outcomes in complex environments.",

    "title": "Canonical Wnt signaling controls the fate and plasticity of NG2 glia in the healthy and ischemic adult mouse cortex",
    "content": "NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), exhibit unexpected plasticity in the adult brain after injury, yet the molecular cues guiding their fate remain poorly defined. Wnt signaling contributes to tissue responses following ischemic stroke, but its precise role in post-injury glial remodeling is not fully understood. Here, we define how Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling shapes NG2 glial behavior after focal cerebral ischemia. Using genetic mouse models enabling cell-specific Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological recording, we disclosed a central role for Wnt signaling in post-injury fate specification. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the oligodendroglial lineage, including a subset with an astrocyte-like transcriptional profile. Wnt signaling strongly influenced the balance between OPC proliferation and differentiation: pathway hyperactivation impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and expanded astrocyte-like NG2-derived cells, likely through concomitant activation of the Notch pathway. Remarkably, Wnt hyperactivation also induced the appearance of cholinergic neuron-like cells derived from NG2-expressing cells exclusively in the somatosensory cortex; these cells generated action potentials and exhibited sodium conductance characteristic of functional neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that NG2 glia undergo distinct fate transitions after stroke and that their lineage plasticity is highly sensitive to Wnt pathway dynamics. Targeted fine-tuning of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may enable directed redirection of NG2 glia toward specific reparative outcomes, including neuronal reprogramming, in the injured adult brain.",

    "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Willed Attention Control",
    "content": "Cueing paradigms are commonly used to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention control. In these paradigms, each trial starts with an external cue, which instructs the subject to pay covert attention to a spatial location in anticipation of an impending stimulus (instructed attention). Recent work has introduced a new type of cue which prompts the subject to spontaneously decide which spatial location to attend (willed attention). We studied the neural mechanisms of willed attention control by analyzing fMRI and EEG data recorded at two institutions (UF and UC Davis) using the same willed attention paradigm. The findings include: (1) both instructional cues and the choice cue activated the DAN, (2) the choice cue additionally activated a frontoparietal decision network consisting of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) the decision about where to attend can be decoded in frontoparietal decision network in choice trials but not in instructional trials, and (4) EEG alpha oscillation patterns immediately preceding the choice cue, but not the instructional cues, predicted the postcue direction of attention and the frontoparietal decision network activity. Based on these findings we proposed a model of willed attention control revealing how the direction of visual spatial attention was decided upon in the absence of external instructions.",

    "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of experimental pain on rat grimace scale scores",
    "content": "The rat grimace scale (RGS) purports to assess behavioural responses related to pain by assessing four facial expressions. To understand how experimental pain affects RGS scores, we conducted a systematic review of studies which reported outcomes using this scale (CRD42022292189). Systematic searches were conducted on 3 databases in January 2022. RGS studies that assessed the effects of disease models relating to pain were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using a modified version of the CAMARADES reporting checklist and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A standardised mean difference effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Fifty-four studies were included, in which 15 disease model classes and 16 classes of pharmacological interventions were identified. RGS scores were increased in disease models hypothesised to be associated with persistent pain (SMD = -4.44 [95%CI -6.25 to -2.63]) and this response was attenuated by analgesic drugs (SMD = 1.97 [95%CI 1.25 to 2.69]). Post-surgical models (39% of experiments) and opioids (30% of experiments) were the most commonly reported. We could not ascertain the sources of heterogeneity due to insufficient data. Most studies were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting quality. The relationship between RGS scores and mechanically evoked limb withdrawal was inconsistent. These findings indicate emerging evidence to support the use of RGS in persistent pain research, but additional research is needed to strengthen these findings. Future studies could benefit from using sex-balanced animal populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. To enhance the impact and reproducibility of their findings, studies should prioritise improvements in reporting quality.",

    "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "A high-content imaging workflow to screen for molecules that reduce cellular uptake of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils",
    "content": "A classical pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the formation of protein-rich aggregates and inclusions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.",

    "title": "10.5 Tesla High-Resolution Macaque Brain MRI for Connectivity Studies",
    "content": "Mapping brain connectivity in primates remains a major challenge due to difficulties in resolving microscopic white matter architecture, while maintaining whole-brain coverage. Increasing imaging spatial resolution is key for disambiguating fiber configurations within smaller anatomical volumes. Here, we present developments that allow high-resolution diffusion MRI of the macaque brain, both in vivo and ex vivo, using one of the world's highest-field human MRI scanners operating at 10.5 Tesla. Our approach achieves data of highest reported resolutions for this field strength and scanner type, (750 m)3 in vivo and (400 m)3 ex vivo, with diffusion weighting up to b = 6000 s/mm2. We detail methodological advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and whole-brain tractography that overcome critical challenges associated with ultra-high-field imaging. This work establishes a new benchmark for high-resolution neuroimaging at 10.5T, paving the way for comparable human studies and enabling analyses of brain connectivity across species and tissue states at unprecedented detail. The dataset, along with all processing pipelines, containerised workflows, and reusable web services, is openly shared to support reproducibility and future integration with microscopy for studying white matter microstructure and connections at the mesoscale.",

    "title": "Associations between amygdala connectivity and experienced discrimination in children",
    "content": "Discrimination is a chronic stressor linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding associations between early discrimination and the brain in childhood may help identify mechanisms through which discrimination impacts future health. Data from 4512 children (ages 9-11) and a subsample of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC; N = 1567) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) was used to create linear mixed-effects models that evaluated associations between Perceived Discrimination (PD) and amygdala resting-state fMRI connectivity (AC) to the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and thalamus. PD was measured using the youth self-reported PD Scale. Results indicated that greater PD significantly predicted greater AC to the right thalamus in our full sample. In secondary analyses, environmental and behavioral factors were evaluated as potential moderators for associations significant at least at a trend level in both our full sample and BIPOC subsample. In our BIPOC subsample, traumatic events experienced (TE) moderated the relationship between PD and AC to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; SN), such that greater TE predicted stronger positive associations between PD and this connection. Results suggest PD impacts neural connections in early life, highlighting the need to consider the impact of discrimination on risk for psychopathology.",

    "title": "PATZ1 remodels the nucleosome landscape to promote chromatin accessibility in injured neurons",
    "content": "Adult central nervous system neurons fail to regenerate after injury, in part due to epigenetic constraints that maintain a growth-restrictive chromatin state. We previously showed that the transcription factor PATZ1 reprograms chromatin accessibility in injured corticospinal neurons to promote axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we use nucleosome-resolution profiling to reveal that PATZ1 induces widespread nucleosome eviction at regeneration-associated gene loci. PATZ1 treatment dramatically reduces both nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness, indicating active chromatin remodeling rather than passive destabilization. This remodeling occurs preferentially at distal regulatory elements, where PATZ1 drives a greater than 3-fold expansion of H3K27ac-marked active enhancers. Nucleosome eviction at these sites precedes enhancer activation, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that targeted nucleosome eviction at enhancers underlies PATZ1-mediated chromatin reorganization, providing mechanistic insight into how epigenetic barriers to CNS regeneration can be overcome.",

Here we hypothesized that the previously observed disease-modifying effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade occur through clearance of senescent microglia. Using CyTOF, we found that a single systemic anti-PD-L1 injection leads to rapid elimination of senescent microglia in 5xFAD and aged wild-type mice, independently of Fc effector function, while increasing homeostatic microglia. These findings suggest that immune rejuvenation via PD-L1 blockade promotes disease modification in AD through senescent-microglial elimination.",

    "title": "Open-access template and database approaches for pseudo-CT generation in brain PET/MRI attenuation correction",
    "content": "Positron emission tomography (PET) provides high-sensitivity molecular information in neuroimaging. However, its quantitative accuracy critically depends on attenuation correction (AC). Unlike PET/CT, hybrid PET/MRI systems cannot directly measure photon attenuation, necessitating alternative AC strategies. While several MRI-based AC tools exist, they often raise concerns regarding data privacy, long-term accessibility and reproducibility. We present an open-access framework for PET AC using pseudo-CT (pCT) methods. A database of 60 paired MRI-CT scans was curated and normalized to stereotactic MNI space. Three established pCT approaches (Boston, MaxProb, UCL) were adapted to enable their use with the normalized database. Method performance was assessed by comparison with a CT-based AC reference in an independent validation sample of 28 subjects, using the Jaccard index and [11C]DASB PET-derived serotonin transporter quantification as evaluation metrics. Boston and MaxProb demonstrated consistent performance across database subsets, while the UCL achieved the closest agreement with CT-derived AC and yielded the lowest quantification error (mean relative error <0.5%). This work demonstrates the feasibility of different pCT approaches using a database in MNI space thereby introducing an openly available reference database to support fast, reproducible and continued integration of MRI-based AC into PET reconstruction pipelines.",

    "content": "The human brain organizes fragmented information into internal maps that support inference of latent relational structure. Vulnerabilities in this mapping process have been hypothesized to contribute to psychosis-spectrum disorders. Whether internal maps arise as readily from visual input as from linguistic description remains unknown. Here, participants learned food items associated with two abstract attributes, presented as images or language, organized along two abstract dimensions within a two-dimensional conceptual space. Participants then completed similarity judgments and reward-learning tasks that required inference of the underlying relational structure. We show that cognitive disorganization, a hallmark of psychosis-spectrum traits, selectively impairs spatial sensitivity and reward generalization when relational structure must be inferred from visual input, but not when matched structure is provided by linguistic descriptions. These findings support the shallow cognitive map hypothesis and suggest that cognitive disorganization selectively disrupts the transformation of perceptual input into stable relational representations.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Leveraging transcranial ultrasound stimulation to enhance self-regulation in emotion and sleep",
    "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

    "title": "Gender perception of pareidolia faces in emergency department patients: the influence of physician gender",
    "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "<p>Full Paper (Zenodo):<p><a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/18027729\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zenodo.org/records/18027729</a><p>Help Needed:<p>I am looking for feedback on the experimental setup.<p>The main engineering challenge is maintaining GHZ coherence long enough to isolate the effect from environmental noise.<p>If you have<p>Hi HN. Standard General Relativity posits that time dilation is caused solely by mass-energy. But what happens when information entropy reaches a critical density?<p>I have released Version 2.0 of my paper, proposing the Information-Induced Time Dilation (ITD) hypothesis.<p>The Hypothesis:<p>I propose that local information entropy (\\Delta S_{info}) acts as a \"computational load\" on the spacetime metric.

    "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
    "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "Chronic brain sensing devices, such as the Medtronic Percept\u2122 or Neuropace RNS system, record local field potentials (LFPs) that may be vulnerable to interference and noise due to hardware limitations, environmental factors, movement, stimulation, cardiac signals, and analytical procedures. Although onboard hardware filters can attenuate some unwanted signals, additional processing is often required. Here we demonstrate that cardiac artifacts significantly alter the power spectral density (PSD) of neural activity within the theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201312 Hz), and beta (12\u201330 Hz) bands. We introduce a time-domain template subtraction method specifically designed to remove QRS complex cardiac artifacts. Separately, we describe techniques for transforming time domain data to the frequency domain and mitigating transient artifacts by estimating background neural activity\u2014either through window rejection based on PSD characteristics or via principal component analysis. Finally, we present an approach to isolate oscillatory neural activity by subtracting the aperiodic 1/f component from the power spectrum by fitting the fitting oscillations and one over F logarithmic function. While filter selection must be tailored to the specific device and participant environment to avoid over-filtering, these interference and noise mitigation strategies are crucial for ensuring the integrity of LFP recordings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.16616v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network, be it at small scale made of cells, mostly neurons, or at larger scale made of neuronal assemblies. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest attempt to walk in the footsteps of classical thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator in physics, or the cogito in philosophy.",

    "title": "Real-time functional connectivity-based neurofeedback of the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during threat-exposure attenuates anxiety",
    "content": "Background: Adaptive regulation of negative emotion is vital for mental health and dysregulations in this domain contribute to the major mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. On the neural level, efficient emotion regulation has been linked to functional communication between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the amygdala. Gaining voluntary control over this pathway may present an effective strategy for potentiating emotion regulation. Objective: Against this background, we developed a novel connectivity-based real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) training that enables individuals to gain volitional control over the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during exposure to threatening stimuli. Methods: The study employed a pre-registered, randomized, sham-controlled design with the experimental group (n = 22) receiving real-time NF information on connectivity between the right DLPFC and the amygdala during threat exposure and the sham control group (n = 23) receiving connectivity NF from a circuit not related to emotion regulation. The ability to maintain regulatory control in the absence of feedback was assessed after four NF runs. Primary outcomes included functional connectivity of the target pathway, as well as anxiety scores. Results: The results demonstrate that successful acquisition of self-regulation of the rDLPFC-amygdala top-down regulatory circuit in the experimental NF group facilitated attenuation of anxiety. Conclusion: In summary, our findings suggest that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows to volitionally enhance rDLPFC-amygdala connectivity, and in turn reduces negative emotional states, rendering the training a promising neurotechnology intervention for mental disorders.",

    "title": "Juvenile reinstatement of TCF4 in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome model mice reveals a critical window for genetic intervention",
    "content": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 which encodes transcription factor 4. As PTHS therapeutics advance toward clinical trials, identifying the optimal timing for treatment is crucial. Our previous research demonstrated that restoring TCF4 during embryonic or neonatal stages, corresponding to prenatal or neonatal periods in humans, improved phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model (Kim et al., 2022). However, PTHS diagnosis generally occurs much later, when infants fail to reach developmental milestones and undergo genetic testing. This raises an essential question: can genetic therapeutics initiated at more clinically relevant time points retain effectiveness? Here, we examined whether reinstating TCF4 in juvenile PTHS model mice could reverse behavioral phenotypes, simulating a gene therapy. Our findings indicate that this delayed intervention largely fails to correct most phenotypes, except for a measure of cognitive function. These results reveal phenotype-specific plasticity and underscore a narrow, early critical window for effective treatment in PTHS. Our study also identifies the hippocampus as a potential target for PTHS therapeutics and suggests that while some cognitive functions may still retain therapeutic plasticity, reversing most core PTHS symptoms may require intervention during the very early postnatal, or potentially prenatal periods, in humans.",

    "title": "In vivo human embryonic spinal cord atlas validates stem cell-derived human dorsal interneurons and reveals ASD spinal signatures",
    "content": "Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in the loss of motor and sensory function. We are working towards restoring sensation by developing directed differentiation protocols to generate dorsal spinal interneurons (dIs; dI1-dI6) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we present an improved method that produces human dIs via a neuromesodermal progenitor state, the physiological intermediate for spinal cord development. We show that retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 11 direct dI identity, while GDF11 and extended time in culture promotes posterior spinal identities. Together, these protocols generate the full complement of dorsal subtypes along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord. To benchmark in vitro-derived dIs, we constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas of the human embryonic spinal cord and used it to show that hESC-derived dIs closely match their endogenous counterparts. The atlas also reveals that the dI4/dI5 populations dramatically expand in comparison with the other spinal lineages. Moreover, they have mechanosensory circuit signatures linked to autism spectrum disorder, implicating spinal circuits in autistic phenotypes.",

    "title": "Basal Ganglia Dopamine Availability and Immune Activation Interact and Relate to Anhedonia Severity among Youth with Depression",
    "content": "Anhedonia emerges in adolescence, has putative substrates in neural reward and dopamine systems, and is a hallmark of poor course in depression. Psychoneuroimmunology models suggest altered immune and reward systems may jointly underlie its development. When dopamine availability (rather than function) is considered, immune activation may be understood as a moderator amplifying how lower dopamine levels translate into motivational deficits. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 55 youth with current depression (Mage=21.4 years; Female=75%). Plasma was assayed for relative quantification of 92 immune proteins, followed by dimensionality reduction via principal component (PC) analysis, forming five PC scores. Dopamine availability was indexed by basal ganglia tissue iron, quantified by MRI R2', a measure detectable in youth. Anhedonia was assessed using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), thought to capture overall anhedonia, and Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS), which provides overall, anticipatory, and consummatory anhedonia scores. PC1 scores-whose loadings indicated broadly distributed immune protein elevations consistent with general immune activation-moderated the relationship between basal ganglia dopamine availability and anhedonia: At higher PC1 levels, lower dopamine availability was linked to greater overall anhedonia (as measured by SHAPS) and anticipatory anhedonia, but not to consummatory anhedonia. Lower PC2 scores were associated with greater PVSS overall and consummatory anhedonia. Analyses examining individual basal ganglia regions suggest potential differences in dopaminergic-immune interactions across these regions, with effects most consistently observed in the putamen. Findings highlight nuanced neuroimmune pathways underlying anhedonia components in youth and support inflammation-based models of depression emphasizing dopaminergic-immune interplay.",

    "title": "Early adversity potentiates prefrontal - amygdala communication through CRH+ glutamatergic neurons",
    "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) has enduring impacts on emotion circuit function. Following early maltreatment, neglect, or instability in the home, individuals often exhibit lifelong impairments in their evaluation and response to threats. These behavioral changes typically emerge during adolescence and can disrupt this period of enhanced exploration that drives experience-dependent maturation in emotional brain systems. However, the mechanisms linking ELA to increased threat responses remain unclear. We identified a stress-sensitive medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-basolateral amygdala pathway that co-expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and glutamate. We find that ELA strengthens this pathway and increases threat avoidance behavior during adolescence. Inhibiting this pathway rescues ELA-induced elevations in adolescent avoidance, selectively in males. Reducing mPFC CRH expression earlier in development in typically-reared mice mimics ELA phenotypes in males. Together, our findings indicate that CRH signaling regulates developmental circuit plasticity, biasing emotional circuit function and potentially contributing to psychiatric vulnerability.",

    "title": "Hippocampal Cdk5 is regulated by distinct stress paradigms in male and female mice",
    "content": "Anxiety and mood disorders have been rising since the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by social isolation and stress. Women are disproportionately affected by stress-related disorders, yet the interaction between social isolation and stress remains understudied in females. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical kinase that exhibits sex-specific regulation following various stressors but is studied almost exclusively in males. To complement these findings, we examined sex differences in mouse hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA and protein following short and long restraint stress with or without concomitant social isolation stress. While short restraint stress was sufficient to promote anxiety-like in both male and female mice, it did not alter Cdk5. Rather, hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA increased only after a longer restraint stress duration followed by social isolation, and only in male mice. Hippocampal Cdk5 protein also shifted from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment only in male hippocampus. Surprisingly, repeated restraint stress promoted exploratory behavior in both group-housed and socially isolated male and female mice. Social isolation alone increased Cdk5 protein in females only. Finally, under all conditions, female mice were less immobile and more exploratory than male mice. Together, these results provide new insight into the sex-specific regulation of hippocampal Cdk5 by the combination of psychological and environmental stressors.",

    "title": "Spatially resolved translational dysregulation in Grin2a+/- mouse model of schizophrenia",
    "content": "Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations of GRIN2A, encoding the GluN2A subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), confer a high risk for schizophrenia (SCZ), yet how they affect diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we combined subcellular-resolution spatial omics technologies, STARmap and RIBOmap, to jointly resolve single-cell transcriptomes and translatomes for 3,447 genes in the brains of Grin2a+/- mice and their wild-type littermates across 538,188 cells. Translational dysregulation was markedly more prominent than transcriptional changes in neurons. Across neuronal subtypes, a set of genes including Camk2a, Arc, Egr1, Egr3, Chmp2b, and Pja2 exhibited translational reduction in a Grin2a gene dose-dependent fashion, suggesting a connection between NMDAR hypofunction and reduced protein synthesis of downstream synaptic plasticity effectors. In interneurons (particularly parvalbumin interneurons), a strong reduction of Gad2 translation implies loss of inhibitory function in cortical microcircuits, which has long been hypothesized for SCZ pathophysiology. Non-neuronal cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular cells also exhibited region-specific translational changes in neurotransmitter transport, lipid synthesis, myelination, and stress response pathways, some of which co-varied with regional neuron state. Together, our study reveals brain-wide translation dysregulation as a critical mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology.",

    "title": "Figure--ground relationship of voices in musical structure modulates reciprocal frontotemporal connectivity",
    "content": "When listening to polyphonic music, we often perceive a melody as the figure against the ground of accompanying sounds. However, with repeated exposure, this figure--ground relationship may naturally shift, allowing the melody to recede into the ground. In a previous study, we found the consistent pattern of frontotemporal connectivity for the ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' (TTLS) melody in the headings of two variations (II and IV) in Mozart's 12 Variations, K. 265, indicating that the TTLS melody, but not the different lower voices, was the figure. However, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern may change in the same phrases repeating in the two variations. In the current study, we examined how frontotemporal connectivity changes in the repeated phrases. In the results, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern between the two variations changed in the final phrase after repeated passages. This suggests that the shift in the figure--ground relationship persists, with the TTLS melody becoming less prominent while the lower voices become relatively more prominent. Additionally, frontotemporal connectivity was strongly correlated with temporofrontal connectivity in the opposite direction. Finally, our data indicate that TTLS melody-based and sensory-based processes in response to a switched figure--ground relationship, are incorporated into the bidirectional connections between frontotemporal and temporofrontal connectivity. Our study highlights the brain's ability to reconfigure figure--ground relationships in the processing of musical voices.",

    "content": "Behavioral studies show that humans process concrete words more similarly across languages than abstract words. This suggests that in bilingual brains, semantic representations may be more similar across languages for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, but existing neuroimaging evidence is inconclusive. Here, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from fluent Chinese-English bilinguals who read several hours of naturalistic narratives in both languages. We used encoding models to estimate voxelwise tuning towards concrete and abstract concepts in each language separately. We then quantified the similarity of cortical semantic representations across languages. First, we find that the cortical organization of concreteness tuning is consistent across languages. Second, semantic representations are similar across languages for both concrete-tuned voxels and abstract-tuned voxels. Third, we find that for abstract concepts, cross-language similarity of semantic representations may be driven by emotionality. Overall, these findings reveal how concreteness affects semantic representations in bilingual brains.",

Here we reliably record and model neural responses to natural conversational speech while participants are walking, demonstrating the feasibility of combining EEG with whole-body movement monitoring. Participants (N = 61) performed focused listening and natural conversation while walking indoors and outdoors. Motion sensors, EEG, and audio recordings captured behavioural, neural, and motor dynamics. Walking speed varied with environment and task: faster outdoors and slower during speaking. Temporal alignment between gait and speech revealed coordinated rhythmic interactions, stronger during speaking than listening. Auditory temporal response functions were preserved across listening tasks. Gait TRFs displayed lateralized and temporal dynamics consistent across tasks. These results provide insight into the coordinated interplay of speech, brain activity, and movement. This highlights the potential of multimodal approaches in ecologically valid settings.",

MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of 247.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15\u2009bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.44\u2009bpm on the BETA dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency.

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

    "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "content": "Cortical population activity often evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, shaped by external activity, task-demands and the underlying neuronal network structure. The structure of population activity has been studied across many brain areas and species. However, the influence of retinotopic organization in the structure of population activity of the primate visual cortex in vivo remains understudied. Here, we show that retinotopy in primary visual cortex (V1) determines the topological structure in neural population activity in the macaque. We analysed large-scale extracellular recordings from two macaques implanted with 896-channel Utah arrays in V1 performing a receptive field mapping task, with high-contrast moving bars. Isometric Mapping (isomap) applied to the neural population activity revealed a loop-like manifold. Persistent homology on 10-dimensional embeddings confirmed a single dominant one-dimensional loop. To test whether retinotopy alone can account for this structure, we constructed a minimal neural response model and simulated activity with the same stimuli as the macaque neural data. The model reproduced the loop-like topology observed in the brain. Taken together, the experimental and simulated data show that retinotopic maps naturally induce loop-like neural manifolds in response to moving stimuli, directly linking travelling waves and rotational dynamics. Our results provide a basis for further analysis on how neuronal populations encode and process visual information at the population level.",

    "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "title": "Suppressive Interactions between Nearby Stimuli in Visual Cortex Reflect Crowding",
    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "title": "Attention Decoding at the Cocktail Party: Preserved in Hearing Aid Users, Reduced in Cochlear Implant Users",
    "content": "Users of hearing aids (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs) experience significant difficulty understanding a target speaker in multi-talker environments or when other background noise is present. Segregation of a particular voice from background noise occurs partly through enhanced cortical tracking of amplitude fluctuations in the target signal. Measuring a person's cortical tracking allows decoding their focus of attention and may be used for neurofeedback in hearing devices, potentially aiding their users with speech-in-noise comprehension. Most studies on cortical tracking have employed typical hearing (TH) individuals, whereas studies in people with hearing impairment whose cortical tracking may differ are still scarce. The objective of this study was to compare cortical speech tracking of HA (n=29) and CI users (n=24) to that of age-matched TH individuals (n=29). We recorded EEG data while the participants attended one of two competing talkers (one with a female and one with a male voice), in a free-field acoustic environment. Importantly, HA users as well as CI users used their personal, clinically-fitted devices. Cortical speech tracking was assessed through linear backward and forward models that related the EEG data to the speech envelope. For the CI users, electrical artifacts stemming from the implant were addressed through a bespoke method for artifact rejection. We found that the HA group exhibited cortical tracking and attentional modulation that were largely comparable to those of the TH group. CI users also showed successful cortical tracking. However, they displayed a profound deficit in attentional modulation, seen in the significantly poorer neural segregation of the attended vs. the ignored speech streams. These results shed light on a neurobiological mechanism for speech-in-noise comprehension and have implications for neurofeedback in hearing devices.",

Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.",

Therefore, numerous studies were conducted to examine communication patterns in esports teams. While non-verbal communication has been extensively investigated, research on assessing voice-based verbal communication patterns remains relatively understudied. In this study, we propose a framework that automatically assesses verbal communication patterns by constructing networks with utterances transcribed from voice recordings. Through a data collection study, we obtained 84 game sessions from five League of Legends teams and subsequently investigated how verbal communication patterns varied across different conditions. As a result, we revealed that esports players exhibited broader and more balanced participation in collaborative situations, increased utterances over time with the largest rise in decision making, and team-level differences that were contingent on effective professional training. Building upon these findings, this study provides a generalizable tool for analyzing effective team communication.",

During this workshop, participants will experience a structured three-phase methodology: creating a human-led narrative foundation, identifying strategic gaps, and collaborating on AI enhancements. The workshop combines theoretical foundations with intensive hands-on practice, enabling participants to create compelling HCI visual narratives that demonstrate effective human-AI partnership. Through sequential art techniques, storyboarding exercises, and guided AI integration, attendees learn to communicate complex interactive concepts, accessibility solutions, and user experience flows while preserving narrative coherence and creative vision. Building on our successful workshops at ACM C&amp;C 2025, this session specifically addresses the needs of the Chinese HCI community for culturally informed and pedagogically sound approaches to AI integration in creative education.",

    "title": "Developers' Experience with Generative AI -- First Insights from an Empirical Mixed-Methods Field Study",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.19926v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the rise of AI-powered coding assistants, firms and programmers are exploring how to optimize their interaction with them. Research has so far mainly focused on evaluating output quality and productivity gains, leaving aside the developers' experience during the interaction. In this study, we take a multimodal, developer-centered approach to gain insights into how professional developers experience the interaction with Generative AI (GenAI) in their natural work environment in a firm. The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study. During the uncontrolled period of the study, both higher cognitive load and productivity were perceived when interacting with AI during everyday working tasks. This study motivates the use of comparable study designs, in e.g. workshop or hackathon settings, to evaluate GenAI tools holistically and realistically with a focus on the developers' experience.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.19898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Community participation is an important aspect of an individuals physical and mental well-being. This participation is often limited for persons with disabilities, especially those with ambulatory impairments due to the inability to optimally navigate the community. Accessibility is a multi-faceted problem and varies from person to person. Moreover, it depends on various personal and environmental factors. Despite significant research conducted to understand challenges faced by wheelchair users, developing an accessibility model for wheelchair users by identifying various characteristic features has not been thoroughly studied. In this research, we propose a three-dimensional model of accessibility and validate it through in-depth qualitative analysis involving semi-structured interviews and participatory action research. The outcomes of our studies validated many of our hypotheses about community access for wheelchair users and identified a need for more accessible path planning tools and resources. Overall, this research strengthened our three-dimensional User-Wheelchair-Environment model of accessibility.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.19885v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualization plays a relevant role for discovering patterns in big sets of data. In fact, the most common way to help a human with a pattern interpretation is through a graphic. In 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training the student interaction is more varied and complex than in traditional e-learning environments. Therefore, the visualization and interpretation of students' behaviors becomes a challenge. This motivated us to design the visualization of a collective student model built from student logs taken from 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training. This paper presents the design decisions that enable a suitable visualization of this model to instructors as well as a web tool that implements this visualization and is intended: to help instructors to improve their own teaching; and to enhance the tutoring strategy of an Intelligent Tutoring System. Then, this paper illustrates, with three detailed examples, how this tool can be used to those educational purposes. Next, the paper presents an experiment for validating the utility of the tool. In this experiment we show how the tool can help to modify the tutoring strategy of a 3D virtual laboratory. In this way, it is shown that the proposed visualization of the model can serve to improve the performance of students in 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.19832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI's humanlike qualities are driving its rapid adoption in professional domains. However, this anthropomorphic appeal raises concerns from HCI and responsible AI scholars about potential hazards and harms, such as overtrust in system outputs. To investigate how technology workers navigate these humanlike qualities and anticipate emergent harms, we conducted focus groups with 30 professionals across six job functions (ML engineering, product policy, UX research and design, product management, technology writing, and communications). Our findings reveal an unsettled knowledge environment surrounding humanlike generative AI, where workers' varying perspectives illuminate a range of potential risks for individuals, knowledge work fields, and society. We argue that workers require comprehensive support, including clearer conceptions of ``humanlikeness'' to effectively mitigate these risks. To aid in mitigation strategies, we provide a conceptual map articulating the identified hazards and their connection to conflated notions of ``humanlikeness.''",

However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are firstly grouped into clusters. Then an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.",

Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.10261v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20481v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20319v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).\n  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.\n  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.\n  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20044v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents.",

Here, we developed neuroreceptor-based semisynthetic sensors that record synaptic Zn(II) dynamics by covalent chemistry in the living mouse brain. Using a chemical knock-in strategy, we introduced activity-based Zn(II)-probes with distinct affinities into endogenous alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid or gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. These in-brain-constructed Zn(II) sensors enabled, to our knowledge, for the first time, quantitative, region-specific mapping of Zn(II) released into synaptic clefts. Imaging-based analyses revealed differences inZn(II) concentrations at excitatory and inhibitory synapses across hippocampal regions during kainate-induced seizures, providing new insights into the physiological and pathological functions of synaptic Zn(II).",

    "title": "Dopaminergic Neurons in the Brain Orchestrates Cardiac and Behavioral Threat Responses",
    "content": "Heartbeat and behavior are often modulated in a tightly coupled fashion, which is believed advantageous for survival. For instance, when threatened animals show freezing or escaping, the brain drives cardiac deceleration or acceleration, respectively. In turn, the heart sends ascending feedback to the brain, but whether and how the descending regulation of and the ascending feedback from the heart might drive the heart-behavior coupling remains unknown. Here we show in Drosophila that mechanical threat induces not only locomotion but cardiac deceleration. We further identified two pairs of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, called DA-WED neurons, that are responsible for threat-induced cardiac deceleration. Silencing DA-WED neurons suppresses threat-induced cardiac deceleration, while activation of DA-WED neurons can replace threat to induce cardiac deceleration. Our calcium imaging analysis shows that threat activates DA-WED neurons. Interestingly, silencing DA-WED neurons to block threat-induced cardiac deceleration reduces locomotion. Conversely, direct manipulation of cardiomyocytes to artificially induce cardiac deceleration promotes locomotion. Together, our data reveals a neuronal mechanism in which mechanical threat regulates the heartbeat through dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and suggests how these neurons possibly prompt feedback from the heart to modulate behavior.",

    "title": "Attention biases the appearance of rapidly alternating stimuli",
    "content": "Attentional selection not only increases behavioural performance and neural information for attended stimuli but, in some instances, induces changes in stimulus appearance. While reported appearance changes have mostly concerned the effects of attending to a particular spatial location, here we report a shift in appearance that occurs when attention is directed to one component of a rapidly alternating stimulus. Our stimuli included two frames of different colours, which alternated at 3.75Hz or 7.5Hz. Participants reported the perceived dominance of one frame's colour in the target stimulus, by comparison with a reference stimulus. We found that when one stimulus frame was more salient than the other, capturing exogenous attention, there was an illusory perception that the frame was physically present for a greater proportion of time. When the frames were matched in salience, endogenously directing attention to one frame produced a smaller shift in appearance. Our results add to the body of literature demonstrating that attention can change appearance, in this case altering the appearance of attended versus unattended stimuli that are presented at the same spatial location. Furthermore, our results support the notion that in 'temporal transparency', where rapidly alternating stimuli are perceived as two translucent surfaces, attentional selection of one surface can account for the apparent paradox that feature conjunctions are perceived at stimulus alternation rates higher than predicted by the temporal limits of feature binding for other stimuli.",

    "title": "Restoration of Higher-Order Cortical Processing in Rat V2 by Retinal Sheet Transplants in Degenerated Rats",
    "content": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, and effective treatment options are limited once photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are lost. In advanced stages, vision restoration requires strategies that replace or bypass degenerated retinal circuitry. Retinal sheet transplantation using fetal neural retinal tissue has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating long-term survival, integration with the host retina, and partial restoration of light-driven responses. We previously showed that such transplants can restore fundamental visual response properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rapidly degenerating rats. However, it remains unclear whether restored retinal input can support higher-order cortical computations that depend on the integration of classical and extra-classical receptive field mechanisms. In this study, we extend this investigation by evaluating whether fetal retinal sheet transplants can restore extra-classical surround modulation in neurons of higher visual areas (V2). Fetal retinal sheets (E18-E19) derived from donor rats were transplanted into one eye of Rho-S334ter line-3 rats at ages P41-P78, when rod degeneration is nearly complete and cones are largely nonfunctional. Animals were assessed 2.2-9.3 months post-surgery using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings from V2, optokinetic testing, OCT imaging, and histology. Control groups included normal-vision rats, age-matched degenerated rats (AMC), and sham-operated line-3 rats. Transplants survived long term, developed laminated and rosetted photoreceptor structures, and integrated with the host retina. Optokinetic testing revealed significant improvement in spatial acuity in transplanted eyes compared with degenerated controls beginning at three months post-surgery. Transplanted rats exhibited a markedly higher proportion of visually responsive V2 neurons than degenerated animals (21.0% vs. 8.2%). They also showed significantly shorter response latencies and larger visually evoked response amplitudes, indicating improved transmission of retinal signals to the cortex. To quantify surround suppression, neurons were tested with sinusoidal gratings confined to the classical receptive field and gratings extended to full-field size. Transplanted rats displayed robust surround suppression properties similar to normal controls, including significantly reduced firing rates and narrower tuning under full-field conditions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on net responses to CRF and FF stimulus sizes reliably distinguished control and transplanted neurons from degenerated ones but could not separate control from transplant, further indicating similar response properties in these two groups. These findings provide the first demonstration that retinal sheet transplants restore not only basic visual responses but also higher-order cortical mechanisms involving extra-classical surround suppression. This recovery of surround suppression in V2 suggests that transplanted retinal tissue can re-establish functionally meaningful circuits capable of supporting complex visual processing. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of retinal sheet transplantation for advanced retinal degenerative disease and provide the first evidence of surround suppression in the rat V2.",

    "title": "Systematic microcircuit reconfigurations underlie early experience-induced visual cortical plasticity",
    "content": "Experience-dependent reorganization of neuronal connections during a postnatal critical period (CP) is essential for the functional maturation of developing primary visual cortex (V1). However, the systematic reconfigurations across microcircuit synapses underlying this plasticity were poorly defined. Paired recording from excitatory pyramidal cells and other three major interneurons (INs) within layers 2/3 and 4 microcircuits in the developing mouse V1 monocular region, we find that monocular deprivation (MD) for one-day during the CP transiently reconfigures local excitatory synapses on inhibitory INs that specifically express parvalbumin (PV) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), whereas prolonged MD primarily strengthens inhibitory transmission from somatostatin (SST)-expressing INs to PV-INs and VIP-INs in both layers. A physiologically based microcircuit model suggests these coordinated synaptic changes in specific inhibitory neurons mediate differential MD-induced plasticity in visual responses across layer 2/3 neurons in vivo. Together, our findings define a systematic microcircuit basis for cortical critical-period plasticity.",
