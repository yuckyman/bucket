    "title": "Resting-state Functional Connections with the Hippocampus and with the Caudate Nucleus Predict Working Memory Performance in Multiple Sclerosis",
    "content": "Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). A related process, working memory (WM), supports long-term EM and is often also impaired. Functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and caudate nucleus supports EM performance. However, this connectivity's specific influences on WM performance in MS is relatively unknown. Resting-state FC (RSFC) possesses clinical utility, including predicting cognitive impairments before they are captured by assessment. The present study tested whether RSFC with the hippocampus and caudate could predict WM performance in people with MS and in healthy individuals (HC). In a secondary analysis of 78 participants (42 MS, 36 HC), RSFC between the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and other regions was quantified. These connections' predictive influence on WM performance was then examined using a global WM performance measure for a subset with available neuropsychological data (26 MS, 15 HC). Across the entire sample (N=78), MS participants displayed stronger coupling between the right hippocampus and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to HC participants. Within MS participants, stronger coupling between the left hippocampus (LHipp) and left ventral anterior cingulate (LvACC), and between the left caudate (LCaud) and right insula, were observed. Stronger decoupling between the LHipp and left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG) also emerged. Stronger LHipp-LvACC connectivity predicted worse WM performance, whereas stronger LHipp-LSMG connectivity and LCaud-RInsula connectivity each predicted better performance. The hippocampal connections were also inversely correlated. Findings identify a caudate circuit and potential hippocampal network whose aberrant, intrinsic activity could serve as neural markers for WM dysfunction in MS.",

    "title": "Architecture of Near-Death Experience Spaces",
    "content": "Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) challenge conventional research methods, as they are often described as exceeding the limits of verbal expression. While most studies rely on narrative accounts, little attention has been given to graphic representations as a complementary mode of investigation. This study employs a hybrid approach combining a semi-structured digital questionnaire with a graphic reconstruction task. Participants first segmented their Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and NDE into distinct experiential sequences by assigning chronological numbers to each phase. This sequencing enabled the identification and isolation of the core NDE component across participants. The graphic reconstructions represent each perceived space, Self-Location (S-L), the perceived spatial position where one experiences oneself to be located and Self-Motion (S-M), the perceived spatial trajectories and directionalities of oneself within these visuo-spatial configurations. This dual-method design was intended to capture experiential features of OBEs and NDEs that may not be conveyed through verbal reports alone. Notably, OBEs have rarely been examined regarding their independence from or conjunction with NDEs, nor their placement within the overall temporal sequence. The graphic reconstructions revealed consistent visual-field invariants: conical forms, elliptic arcs with variable Visual-Field Extents (VFE), and ellipsoidal configurations, each correlated with specific chromatic and luminance perceptual qualities of the Visual Field (VF).",

    "title": "Postural sway in multiple sclerosis patients: interaction of vision, surface, and fatigue effects",
    "content": "IntroductionPostural control impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in postural instability and increased fall risk. Sensory inputs are crucial to maintain balance adequately. Additionally, fatigue is one of the common and most disabling symptoms of MS, possibly contributing to postural deficits. Previous studies have examined the effects of fatigue and altered sensory conditions on postural control in patients with MS. The present study aimed to extend this knowledge by jointly assessing these factors within the same experimental framework, providing additional insight into how fatigue modulates sensory contributions to balance.MethodsA total of 21 patients with MS (age\u202f=\u202f41.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1\u202fyears; EDSS\u202f=\u202f1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; disease duration\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.9\u202fyears) completed balance assessments on firm and compliant surfaces with both eyes open and eyes closed, before and after a 6-min walk test used to induce fatigue. Postural sway was quantified using sway velocity and root mean square (RMS).ResultsThere was a significant effect of surface on sway velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.60), with a greater sway on the compliant surface compared to the firm surface. Fatigue significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.023, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23) but did not affect sway velocity (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The absence of visual input (eyes closed) also significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.46). There was a significant interaction between surface and vision for sway RMS (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.54), with a larger effect of surface instability in the eyes-closed condition.DiscussionPatients with MS face increased challenges in maintaining postural control under conditions of fatigue, surface instability, and lack of visual input. Sway RMS may be more sensitive to these effects than sway velocity.",

    "content": "BackgroundInner speech\u2014the covert articulation of words in one\u2019s mind\u2014is a fundamental phenomenon in human cognition with growing interest across BCI. This pilot study evaluates and compares deep learning models for inner-speech classification using non-invasive EEG derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset (4 participants, 8 words). The study assesses a compact CNN (EEGNet) and a spectro-temporal Transformer using leave-one-subject-out validation, reporting accuracy. Macro-F1, precision, and recall.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate and compare deep learning models for inner speech classification using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data, derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset. The goal is to assess the performance and generalizability of two architectures: the compact convolutional EEGNet and a novel spectro-temporal Transformer.MethodsData were obtained from four healthy participants who performed structured inner speech tasks involving eight target words. EEG signals were preprocessed and segmented into epochs for each imagined word. EEGNet and Transformer models were trained using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy. Performance metrics included accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, precision, and recall. An ablation study examined the contribution of Transformer components, including wavelet decomposition and self-attention mechanisms.ResultsThe spectro-temporal Transformer achieved the highest classification accuracy (82.4%) and macro-F1 score (0.70), outperforming both the standard and improved EEGNet models. Discriminative power was also substantially improved by using wavelet-based time-frequency features and attention mechanisms. Results showed that confusion patterns of social word categories outperformed those of number concepts, corresponding to different mental processing strategies.ConclusionDeep learning models, in particular attention-based Transformers, demonstrate great promise in decoding internal speech from EEG. These findings lay the groundwork for non-invasive, real-time BCIs for communication rehabilitation in severely disabled patients. Future work will take into account vocabulary expansion, wider participant variety, and real-time validation in clinical settings.",

    "content": "ObjectiveColor and spatial location are key cues influencing visual selection in binocular color rivalry, jointly modulating attentional resource allocation and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. However, how these cues\u2014individually and in combination\u2014regulate ocular behavior and PFC activation remains insufficiently understood and lacks systematic empirical investigation.MethodsThis study integrates eye tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and reaction time measurements to systematically investigate the cortical and oculomotor response characteristics under a binocular rivalry paradigm, focusing on color rivalry (Color stimuli), spatial location (Location stimuli), and their combined (Color & Location stimuli).ResultsThe results revealed that Color stimuli elicited rapid saccades, significant pupil dilation, and a decrease in prefrontal HbO concentration. Location stimuli induced stable saccadic patterns and a typical biphasic HbR response in BA46. The combined Color & Location stimuli triggered significant changes in oculomotor behavior during the later processing stage, accompanied by a marked increase in HbO activation in BA10, suggesting its dominant role in multisensory integration and cognitive resource reallocation. Further coupling analyses showed a significant positive correlation between prefrontal HbO concentration and reaction time (r = 0.555, p < 0.01), and a significant negative correlation between HbO concentration and saccade amplitude (r = \u20130.376, p < 0.05), consistent with the theoretical predictions of the \u201cneural efficiency\u2013cognitive load trade-off\u201d model. Task-dependent coupling relationship were also observed among oculomotor parameters and between eye movement and cerebral hemodynamic signals.ConclusionColor stimuli induce rapid saccadic behavior and impose higher prefrontal load, Location stimuli engage a more efficient dorsal pathway, while Color & Location stimuli intensify resource rivalry and induce a processing bottleneck, manifested as prolonged reaction times co-occurring with heightened cortical activation.",

    "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe CONCUSS clinical trial examined the neural changes associated with office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with movement (OBVAM) in concussion-related convergence insufficiency (CONC-CI).MethodsThe following assessments were collected at baseline and post-OBVAM therapy: activity evoked from a functional MRI vergence oculomotor task, near point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence (PFV), vergence facility (VF), and visual symptoms from a sensorimotor vision exam. Fifty-four CONC-CI participants, diagnosed with persisting concussion symptoms between one- and six-months post-injury, were analyzed in group-level results.ResultsFunctional activity in the vergence oculomotor network, specifically the frontal eye fields, supplemental eye fields, parietal eye fields, cerebellar vermis (CV), and visual cortex, increased post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments. Significant increases in post-OBVAM compared to baseline assessments were observed in the visual cortex (bilateral V3 and right area PH) and the CV, via a paired t-test with family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The pooled baseline and post-OBVAM measures revealed that the bilateral functional activities of V3 and CV were significantly correlated with the NPC, PFV, and VF clinical signs, and the right hemisphere area PH within the visual cortex was significantly correlated with VF (Bonferroni-corrected; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To determine whether the CONC-CI post-OBVAM functional brain activity differed from that of the binocularly normal control (BNC) data, an unpaired t-test was performed comparing 46 age-matched BNC datasets with 54 CONC-CI datasets. Significant differences in functional activity between BNC and CONC-CI at post-OBVAM datasets were not observed (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).DiscussionResults support that OBVAM improves functional brain activity in CONC-CI correlated with NPC, PFV, and VF.",

    "content": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is a major cause of thunderclap headache and a preventable source of delayed ischaemic stroke. Despite expanding recognition, diagnosis is often delayed because early neuroimaging may be normal and vasoconstriction peaks in weeks two to three, and management remains experience-based rather than trial-anchored. In this mini-review we summarize advances in clinicoradiological definition and pathophysiology of tone dysregulation, outline risk-stratified diagnostic pathways built on serial CTA/MRA with confirmatory DSA when needed, high-resolution vessel-wall MRI to exclude inflammatory arteriopathy, perfusion MRI/CT and arterial spin labeling, and bedside transcranial Doppler, and appraise translational opportunities spanning time-anchored surveillance, perfusion-preserving care bundles and pragmatic endpoints. We also discuss enduring challenges\u2014including nosological overlap with primary CNS vasculitis, non-standardized imaging schedules, heterogeneous blood-pressure targets and a paucity of randomized data\u2014that temper implementation. By integrating time-aware vascular and perfusion readouts (e.g., planned week-2\u20133 repeat angiography, ASL hypoperfusion mapping, sustained Doppler velocities) with trigger withdrawal, cautious blood-pressure management and symptomatic vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium in selected contexts, emerging strategies aim to preserve cerebral perfusion, anticipate delayed infarction and standardize follow-up across settings. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of RCVS care and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for prospective evaluation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
    "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

    "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

    "title": "Selective reduction of KCNA4 in vulnerable glutamatergic-serotonin neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus in Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "INTRODUCTIONWe previously demonstrated that htau mice recapitulate many neuropsychiatric features of early Alzheimers disease (AD), and that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains distinct subregions. Herein, we investigate vulnerability of the centromedial DRN to pathologically-phosphorylated tau (pTau), a region composed predominantly of dually serotonergic/glutamatergic (5HT/glut) neurons.\n\nMETHODSWe use computational, molecular, biophysical, and behavioral techniques to assess the centromedial DRN across preclinical and post-mortem settings.\n\nRESULTSThe centromedial DRN contains 5HT/glut neurons that differentially express ion-channel genes in the htau mouse. 5HT/glut neurons exhibit increased excitability, which we demonstrate may dually promote pTau accumulation and the severity of depressive-like behaviors in htau mice. At Braak 2, KCNA4 is reduced in 5HT/glut neurons in AD, which are especially vulnerable to pTau compared to 5HT-nonglut neurons.\n\nDISCUSSIONTau-mediated dysfunction of the DRN may be driven by changes in ion channel activity that concomitantly promote the spread of pTau in Braak progression.",

    "title": "PGC-1\u03b1 and PPARs cooperatively mediate photoreceptor neuroprotection in rd1 mouse inherited retinal degeneration",
    "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases characterized by a primary rod photoreceptor dysfunction and progressive rod and cone cell death. Due to their very high energy demand, the degeneration of photoreceptors may be linked to insufficient energy supply or metabolic imbalance. Critical transcription factors that regulate metabolism such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their co-activator PGC-1 have been found to play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases, but their potential roles in RP have yet not been disclosed. In this study, we used organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from the rd1 mouse model for RP to investigate the effects of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists, as well as PGC-1 activation and inhibition. Photoreceptor death in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina was quantified using the TUNEL assay, while in situ activity assays were used to monitor effects of PPARs and PGC-1 on poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and calpain activity. In addition, we performed immunostainings to evaluate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) generation and activation of calpain-1 and calpain-2. We found that PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists had limited effects, while activation of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, and PGC-1 significantly reduced photoreceptor death and PARP activity in rd1 retina. Conversely, inhibition of PGC-1 had a strong detrimental effect on photoreceptor viability. Activation of the histone deacetylase sirtuin-1, an upstream agonist of PGC-1, had no effect unless it was combined with simultaneous inhibition of PARP. Furthermore, PPAR{gamma} and PGC-1 effectively suppressed overall calpain activity and overactivation of calpain-2, alleviating photoreceptor degeneration caused by Ca2+ imbalance. In summary, our data supports the concept of a PARP-sirtuin-1-PGC-1-PPAR-PARP feedback control that connects defective energy metabolism to photoreceptor degeneration. Specifically, our findings suggest that PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, and PGC-1 cooperate to preserve photoreceptor viability, highlighting PPAR signaling as a promising target for future therapeutic interventions.",

    "content": "While the neurobiological distinction between temporally predictable (cued) and unpredictable (contextual) threats has been well-characterized in direct learning using the NPU paradigm, it is poorly understood how these processes unfold during observational learning, a key mechanism of human threat-learning. In this study, we developed a novel observational paradigm based on the NPU paradigm (Experiment 1, n=20, male and female) and combined it with fMRI (Experiment 2, n=23, male and female) to investigate how the brain encodes predictable and unpredictable threat cues observed in others. Participants learned predictable (P), unpredictable (U), and no-threat (N) cues by observation and encountered the same threat cues during an expression phase. Threat expectations indicated that participants successfully learned threat contingencies, showing heightened threat expectations for predictable cues and unpredictable contexts. This converged with neural responses in the anterior insula during the expression phase. Reflecting the dynamic process of learning, the amygdala responded to predictable threat cues with a linear decrease across trials. Interestingly, we found that learning to predict threats from others pain was accompanied by enhanced neural response within the amygdala, insula and hippocampus, as compared to unpredictable conditions. Our findings suggest that humans learn to resolve temporal uncertainty relying solely on observation. The ability to learn shapes the neural response to an observed threat.",

    "title": "Astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound promotes extracellular matrix and maturation in human brain organoids",
    "content": "Heartbeat sound is one of the first rhythmic stimuli encountered by the developing human brain, yet its biological role has remained unexplored. Here we show that heartbeat sound promotes structural and functional maturation of human cortical organoids with a physiological astrocyte-to-neuron ratio. Continuous stimulation with heartbeat expanded the extracellular space (ECS), visualized by super-resolution 3D STED and 2-photon shadow imaging, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, detected by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Heartbeat sound promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation, synaptogenesis, and organoid maturation, as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing, synaptic marker immunohistochemistry, and high-density multielectrode electrophysiology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated astrocyte-specific expression of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels. Using Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed that low-frequency sound stimulation, including heartbeat, activates PIEZO-mediated Ca2+ responses, which in turn upregulate astrocytic ECM synthesis. Experiments with biomimetic hydrogels demonstrated that physiological matrix stiffness attenuates PIEZO activation, suggesting a mechanoprotective mechanism. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental mechanism for inducing ECM synthesis and neural differentiation through astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound, suggesting that interoception of the internal acoustic environment is an underappreciated driver of human brain development.",

    "content": "Despite decades of research on goal-directed behavior in primates, our understanding of frontal cortical circuits in natural social contexts remains very limited. Classic studies with macaques revealed rich motor representations in both ventral premotor (PMv) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), but the limitations imposed by constrained tasks offered a limited window to investigate the complexity of natural behaviors and social interactions. Freely-moving wireless electrophysiological recordings allowed us to investigate the involvement of these areas during different spontaneous behaviors, including social affiliative interactions, and revealed a robust encoding of the social context of motor actions in both PMv and vlPFC. This provides novel evidence that the frontal lobe integrates social information in naturalistic settings, bridging motor control and social cognition, highlighting the need for ecological neuroscience approaches.",

    "title": "Musicianship and active musical engagement predict facilitation of auditory-motor plasticity: evidence from auditory-motor paired associative stimulation",
    "content": "Abstract: Background and Aim: Auditory motor paired associative stimulation (PAS) probes experience dependent plasticity in auditory motor circuits. We tested whether musical experience and musical sophistication modulate PAS induced facilitation when instrument tones are paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. Method: Sixteen musicians and thirteen non-musicians completed two sessions. Session 1 estimated an individualized inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by testing seven tone TMS delays (25 to 300 ms). Session 2 applied PAS at the optimal ISI. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from right first dorsal interosseus at baseline and post-intervention. Group comparisons and a stepwise multiple regression with Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold MSI) subscales evaluated predictors of the PAS effect. Results: A stepwise multiple regression model selected Group and Active Engagement (Gold MSI Factor 1) as independent predictors (F (2,26) = 4.59, p = 0.020, adjusted R2 = 0.204), without interaction: musicians exhibited smaller facilitation than non-musicians, and higher Active Engagement predicted greater facilitation across groups. Discussion: The lack of facilitation in musicians contrasts with somatosensory PAS reports of enhanced plasticity in experts. A modality specific ceiling effect may contribute, whereby long term training optimizes auditory motor transmission, reducing headroom for facilitation. The association with Active Engagement suggests motivational/reward mechanisms potentially dopaminergic gate responsiveness to auditory motor PAS. Conclusion: Under this protocol, auditory motor PAS with instrument tones facilitated corticospinal excitability in non-musicians but not in musicians. Individual differences in Active Engagement predicted facilitation, indicating that both group membership and active musical engagement shape susceptibility to auditory motor associative plasticity.",

    "title": "Elevated activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes feeding during pregnancy in mice",
    "content": "The pregnancy period is accompanied by increased feeding behavior to accommodate the elevated energy demands associated with fetal growth and development. However, the underlying neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms mediating increased feeding during pregnancy are largely unknown. Here, we utilize a combination of fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and mouse behavioral assays to characterize altered feeding behavior during pregnancy in mice. We uncover that pregnancy increases the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system during both homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior in mice. VTA dopamine neurons are ultimately required for promoting increased hedonic feeding during pregnancy as inhibition of these cells selectively reduces acute high fat diet intake in pregnant mice. Further, pregnant mice exhibit increased sensitivity to food deprivation, an effect which requires activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Together, these findings provide a circuit basis mediating altered hedonic feeding behavior and sensitivity to negative energy balance during pregnancy in mice.",

    "title": "The serotonin 1B receptor modulates striatal activity differentially based on behavioral context",
    "content": "The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for goal-directed behavior and has been implicated in both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The DMS circuitry is complex as it integrates multiple inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses the majority of the 14 receptor subtypes for serotonin. In particular, slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo during goal-directed behavior in mice. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function model, we examined the calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS during operant tasks of responding and waiting. We found that knockout of 5-HT1BRs resulted in a significant reduction of excitatory calcium responses and an increase in the proportion of cells with inhibitory calcium responses following receipt of a reward. This suggests that serotonin may recruit MSN activity in response to reward via actions at 5-HT1BRs. On the other hand, in a behavioral paradigm designed to test impulsivity, we found that serotonin may inhibit DMS calcium activity through 5-HT1BRs. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression had a larger proportion of cells showing increased calcium responses during the waiting period of the trial, compared to controls. These results point to the importance of in vivo studies to understand the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context-dependent.",

    "title": "Exploring the functions of JAKMIP1 in neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and its relevance to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome",
    "content": "Growing evidence supports neuroinflammation as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related phenotypes. To better understand molecular factors that modify neuronal cytokine responses in ASD, we investigated potential roles for JAKMIP1, a gene linked to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup15q; a form of syndromic ASD), in regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling. We observe that JAKMIP1 deficiency impairs IL-6/STAT3 signaling and IL-6-induced neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells; and discover that JAKMIP1 may regulate STAT3 expression via its C-terminus, which exhibits nucleoplasmic localization. Additionally, we find that IL-6/STAT3 signaling is altered in Dup15q hiPSCs-derived cortical neurons, which display heightened responsiveness to IL-6; though it is unclear whether and how JAKMIP1 contributes to this. Overall, our findings identify JAKMIP1 as a modulator of neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and support that ASD-linked genetic variants can alter the inflammatory landscape of ASD.",

    "title": "Burst suppression: a default brain state associated with loss of network complexity",
    "content": "Burst suppression (BS) is a highly stereotyped EEG pattern observed across a wide range of clinical contexts, from general anesthesia and postanoxic coma to neonatal encephalopathy. Despite its consistent appearance, BS comprises two distinct forms with markedly different implications. BS with identical bursts (IBS) is almost exclusively seen in patients with severe, irreversible encephalopathy and is consistently associated with poor neurological outcome. In contrast, heterogeneous BS (HBS) can appear in reversible conditions such as anesthesia. The mechanisms that give rise to these divergent forms remain elusive. Existing theories impose disease-specific processes on otherwise healthy networks, but such models fail to explain why BS emerges across diverse etiologies and disregard the clinically critical distinction between IBS and HBS. We combined clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to identify shared mechanisms underlying BS. We analyzed EEG recordings from patients with a severe postanoxic encephalopathy and from patients undergoing general anesthesia. These clinical observations were compared with activity recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks and rodent cortical cultures, and simulations of biophysically grounded neuronal network models. Purely excitatory, low-complexity networks, both in vitro and in silico, spontaneously generated activity virtually indistinguishable from pathological IBS. Introducing inhibitory neurons, modular network structure, or diverse external inputs progressively increased signal complexity and produced HBS-like or continuous activity resembling physiological EEG. Our findings suggest that BS, and particularly IBS, reflects a default dynamic state of simplified excitatory networks that emerges when biological complexity is lost. Different clinical conditions may compromise distinct mechanisms--inhibition, connectivity, or afferent input--yet converge on the same underlying activity pattern. While IBS reflects near-complete loss of complexity, HBS indicates partial preservation. This unified framework explains how diverse etiologies converge on BS and highlights identical forms as signatures of severely reduced network complexity.",

Using a deep-data precision fMRI approach, we identify and richly characterize a network of frontal brain areas that support abstract formal reasoning. This 'abstract reasoning' network robustly dissociates from the domain-general Multiple Demand network--the current leading candidate substrate of fluid intelligence--as well as from three other networks supporting high-level cognition: the language network, the intuitive physical reasoning network, and the social reasoning network. Finally, the areas of this network respond robustly during both deductive and inductive reasoning, during classic matrix reasoning problems, and when solving multiplication and division problems. This network may therefore support the most abstract forms of reasoning, possibly constituting a human-specific adaptation.",

    "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
    "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

    "title": "Altered periodic and aperiodic activities in patients with disorders of consciousness",
    "content": "IntroductionDisorders of consciousness (DoC), including unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), are primarily diagnosed behaviorally. Recent evidence indicates that loss of consciousness manifests as irregularities in neural oscillatory activity across delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. However, conventional spectral analysis often conflates periodic oscillations with aperiodic 1/f components, potentially obscuring consciousness-related dynamics.MethodsTo elucidate the mechanistic basis of spectral alterations in consciousness impairment, we compared oscillatory and aperiodic activity patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients with different consciousness levels. We further examined the spatiotemporal variability of these neural signatures and rigorously evaluated their discriminative power for state classification using support vector machine (SVM) analysis.ResultsWhile periodic and aperiodic activities are independent, our results indicate that both components exhibit significant differences between groups at both local and global scales. Critically, higher spatial and temporal variability of aperiodic features (spectral exponent) were correlated with preserved consciousness. When distinguishing UWS from MCS, the combination of periodic and aperiodic features significantly improved classification performance compared to using either metric alone.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that both periodic oscillations and aperiodic activity provide valuable information about consciousness levels. Critically, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the aperiodic component serve as a key marker of brain state. This underscores the necessity of accounting for aperiodic activity in mechanistic studies and clinical assessments of DoC.",

    "title": "Patient-specific and interpretable deep brain stimulation optimisation using MRI and clinical review data",
    "content": "BackgroundOptimisation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings is a key aspect in achieving clinical efficacy in movement disorders, such as the Parkinson\u2019s disease. Modern techniques attempt to solve the problem through data-intensive statistical and machine learning approaches, adding significant overhead to the existing clinical workflows. Here, we present a geometry-based optimisation approach for DBS electrode contact and current selection, grounded in routinely collected MRI data, well-established tools (Lead-DBS) and optionally, clinical review records.MethodsThe pipeline, packaged in a cross-platform tool, uses lead reconstruction data and simulation of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) to estimate the contacts in optimal position relative to the target structure, and suggests optimal stimulation current. The tool then allows further interactive user optimisation of the current settings. Existing electrode contact evaluations can be optionally included in the calculation process for further fine-tuning and adverse effect avoidance.ResultsBased on a sample of 174 implanted electrode reconstructions from 87 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, we demonstrate that our algorithm\u2019s DBS parameter settings are more effective in covering the target structure (Wilcoxon p\u202f<\u202f5e-13, Hedges\u2019 g\u202f>\u202f0.94) and minimising electric field leakage to neighbouring regions (p\u202f<\u202f2e-10, g\u202f>\u202f0.46) compared to expert parameter settings. Retrospective analysis of a limited subset (n\u202f=\u202f50) predicts comparable improved motor outcomes with expert settings (g\u202f=\u202f0.05\u20130.08, p\u202f=\u202f0.09\u20131), suggesting potential for similar clinical efficacy, pending prospective validation.ConclusionThe proposed automated method for optimisation of the DBS electrode contact and current selection shows promising results and is readily applicable to existing clinical workflows. We demonstrate that the algorithmically selected contacts perform better than manual selections according to electric field calculations, without the iterative optimisation procedure.",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.17938v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS.

    "title": "Vibe Coding: Toward an AI-Native Paradigm for Semantic and Intent-Driven Programming",
    "content": "arXiv:2510.17842v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired \"vibe\" (tone, style, or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment, reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and outline future directions and open research questions.",

We propose a practical framework for implementing Minecraft Education Edition in Bangladesh's 130,000 schools where 55 percent lack reliable internet, rural areas experience 12-16 hour daily power availability, only 8 percent of rural schools have computer access, and student-teacher ratios reach 52:1. Our approach tackles these constraints head-on with three deployment tiers: cloud-based multiplayer for urban schools with stable infrastructure (15 percent), local area network solutions with solar power for semi-urban contexts (30 percent), and offline turn-based modes using refurbished hardware for rural settings (55 percent). We provide eight pre-built curriculum-aligned worlds with complete Bangla localization covering topics from Lalbagh Fort reconstruction to monsoon flood simulation. The interface accommodates first-time users through progressive complexity, culturally familiar metaphors using local farming and architecture, and accessibility features including keyboard-only controls and 200 percent text scaling. Teacher training spans 48 hours across digital literacy, pedagogical integration, and content creation. We detail evaluation protocols with specific benchmarks: 15 percent learning gains, 70 percent transfer task mastery, System Usability Scale scores above 70, and sub-two-dollar cost per student-hour. This framework has not been empirically validated; it synthesizes game-based learning theory, HCI principles, and contextual analysis to provide implementable specifications for pilot testing in resource-constrained settings.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.18311v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In applications where efficiency is critical, developers may examine their compiled binaries, seeking to understand how the compiler transformed their source code and what performance implications that transformation may have. This analysis is challenging due to the vast number of disassembled binary instructions and the many-to-many mappings between them and the source code. These problems are exacerbated as source code size increases, giving the compiler more freedom to map and disperse binary instructions across the disassembly space. Interfaces for disassembly typically display instructions as an unstructured listing or sacrifice the order of execution. We design a new visual interface for disassembly code that combines execution order with control flow structure, enabling analysts to both trace through code and identify familiar aspects of the computation. Central to our approach is a novel layout of instructions grouped into basic blocks that displays a looping structure in an intuitive way. We add to this disassembly representation a unique block-based mini-map that leverages our layout and shows context across thousands of disassembly instructions. Finally, we embed our disassembly visualization in a web-based tool, DisViz, which adds dynamic linking with source code across the entire application. DizViz was developed in collaboration with program analysis experts following design study methodology and was validated through evaluation sessions with ten participants from four institutions. Participants successfully completed the evaluation tasks, hypothesized about compiler optimizations, and noted the utility of our new disassembly view. Our evaluation suggests that our new integrated view helps application developers in understanding and navigating disassembly code.",

Decades of educational technology research show that tools promising personalization and access often deepen inequities due to uneven resources, training, and institutional support. Against this backdrop, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 teachers from a large U.S. school district that was an early adopter of genAI. Our findings reveal the motivations driving adoption, the factors underlying resistance, and the boundaries teachers negotiate to align genAI use with their values. We further contribute by unpacking the sociotechnical dynamics -- including district policies, professional norms, and relational commitments -- that shape how teachers navigate the promises and risks of these tools.",

This technique supports focused analysis without losing spatial context and allows users to switch layers using a dedicated button. Visibility-Preserving Lenses adapt their size and transparency dynamically, enabling detailed inspection of dense spatial regions and temporal attributes. These techniques facilitate urban data exploration and improve prediction. Understanding complex phenomena related to crime, mobility, and residents' behavior is crucial for informed urban planning. Yet navigating such data often causes cognitive overload and visual clutter due to overlapping layers.

Conventional assessment methodologies predominantly depend on clinical interviews and standardised self-report questionnaires. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methodologies is frequently impeded by factors such as subjectivity, recall bias, and accessibility issues. Furthermore, concerns regarding bias and privacy may result in misreporting in data collected through self-reporting in mental health research. The present study examined the design opportunities and challenges inherent in the development of a mental health assessment tool based on natural language interaction with large language models (LLMs). An interactive prototype system was developed using conversational AI for non-invasive mental health assessment, and was evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 11 mental health professionals (six counsellors and five psychiatrists). The analysis identified key design considerations for future development, highlighting how AI-driven adaptive questioning could potentially enhance the reliability of self-reported data while identifying critical challenges, including privacy protection, algorithmic bias, and cross-cultural applicability. This study provides an empirical foundation for mental health technology innovation by demonstrating the potential and limitations of natural language interaction in mental health assessment.",

We then assessed how strongly they believed LLMs to possess various mental capacities, such as the ability have intentions or remember things. We found that participants who watched the companion video reported believing that LLMs more fully possessed these capacities than did participants in other groups. In a follow-up study (N = 604), we replicated these findings and found nuanced effects on how these videos impact people's reliance on LLM-generated responses when seeking out factual information.

    "content": "arXiv:2506.01508v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Our brain learns to update its mental model of the environment by abstracting sensory experiences for adaptation and survival. Learning to categorize sounds is one essential abstracting process for high-level human cognition, such as speech perception, but it is also challenging due to the variable nature of auditory signals and their dynamic contexts. To overcome these learning challenges and enhance learner performance, it is essential to identify the impact of learning-related factors in developing better training protocols. Here, we conducted an extensive meta-analysis of auditory category learning studies, including a total of 111 experiments and 4,521 participants, and examined to what extent three hidden factors (i.e., variability, intensity, and engagement) derived from 12 experimental variables contributed to learning success (i.e., effect sizes). Variables related to intensity and training variability outweigh others in predicting learning effect size. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of the neuroimaging studies revealed training-induced systematic changes in the frontotemporal-parietal networks. Increased brain activities in speech and motor-related auditory-frontotemporal regions and decreased activities in cuneus and precuneus areas are associated with increased learning effect sizes. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the driving forces behind speech and auditory category learning success, along with its neural changes, but also guide researchers and practitioners in designing more effective training protocols that consider the three key aspects of learning to facilitate learner success.",

We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise. Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths. Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.",

The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers.

Information saturates with approximately 64-128 electrodes and scales logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

As a result, self-supervised pretraining has yet to show clear signs of benefits from scale on neural data. Here, we present a novel approach to self-supervised pretraining, POYO-SSL that exploits the heterogeneity of neural data to improve pre-training and achieve benefits of scale. Specifically, in POYO-SSL we pretrain only on predictable (statistically regular) neurons-identified on the pretraining split via simple higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis)-then we fine-tune on the unpredictable population for downstream tasks. On the Allen Brain Observatory dataset, this strategy yields approximately 12-13% relative gains over from-scratch training and exhibits smooth, monotonic scaling with model size. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art baselines plateau or destabilize as model size increases. By making predictability an explicit metric for crafting the data diet, POYO-SSL turns heterogeneity from a liability into an asset, providing a robust, biologically grounded recipe for scalable neural decoding and a path toward foundation models of neural dynamics.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.17837v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate here various properties of the responses of excitable systems subject to periodic forcing and noise. While the properties of intrinsic oscillators, subject to added periodic signals, are well understood, much less is known about the factors that determine the response precision of excitable units, intrinsically at rest, when activated by periodic forcing and stochastic noise. One motivation for considering this issue comes from the behavior of auditory neurons. These neurons reportedly have the ability to fire spikes in a precise range of phases in response to incoming sound waves, a behavior for which the mechanism is unknown. To account for such a response precision, we introduce the notion of dynamic threshold curve (DTC), which estimates at each time the effective likelihood that noise will subsequently generate a spike. The DTC effectively summarizes, in a single curve, a representation of the response precision of an excitable model, as we demonstrate by showing that the distribution of spike times produced in this setting is well captured by the first passage time of a simple, Gaussian stochastic process to the distance to the DTC. This result shows that peaks and troughs of the DTC, but also their slopes, convey fine information about spike timing in response to noise. In particular, it explains properties of Type 2 and Type 3 excitable cells studied previously and provides a framework to predict the DTC properties necessary to support the response precision of auditory neurons, as we illustrate in a well-established auditory neuron model.",

Recent years have seen a rise in studies of neural activations and model alignment. In this work, we review 25 fMRI-based studies published between 2023 and 2025 and explicitly confront their findings with two key hypotheses: (i) the Platonic Representation Hypothesis -- that as models scale and improve, they converge to a representation of the real world, and (ii) the Intermediate-Layer Advantage -- that intermediate (mid-depth) layers often encode richer, more generalizable features. Our findings provide converging evidence that models and brains may share abstract representational structures, supporting both hypotheses and motivating further research on brain-model alignment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.17822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in neural interfacing have enabled significant improvements in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular diagnostics. Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods. This framework paves the way for non-invasive, personalized neuromuscular assessments, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, prosthetic control, and neurorehabilitation.",

We can now explain many aspects of early visual processing based on a relatively simple model of neural circuitry in the retina.

In this article I lay out what that \"standard model\" is and how it accounts for such a diversity of phenomena. The emergence of such a powerful standard model is unique in systems neuroscience, and I consider what conditions made it possible. The standard model now serves as a baseline from which to organize future retinal research, either by testing the model's assumptions directly, or by identifying phenomena that remain unexplained.",

    "content": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production is central to brain homeostasis, yet existing measurement techniques are invasive, technically demanding, and confounded by intracranial perturbations. Here, we introduce indirect deuterium displacement exchange imaging (CSF-iDDxI), a noninvasive MRI approach for mapping CSF production in vivo. The method leverages intravenously infused deuterium oxide (D2O), which crosses the blood-CSF barrier, replaces existing H2O in CSF, producing concentration-dependent attenuation of proton (1H) signal within CSF spaces. Using high-resolution 3D balanced steady-state free precession MRI in rats, we demonstrate robust and spatially widespread D2O-induced CSF signal loss that is selectively suppressed by acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor known to suppress CSF production by the choroid plexus. Dynamic imaging during intravenous D2O infusion further revealed that cortical parenchymal signal changes were unaffected by acetazolamide, confirming specificity to CSF production. Exploratory kinetic modeling estimated rapid CSF water turnover (k ~ 0.09 min-1) under physiological conditions, reduced to k ~ 0.031 min-1 with acetazolamide suppression, consistent with prior isotope tracer studies. Together, these findings establish CSF-iDDxI as a sensitive, pharmacologically validated tool for quantifying CSF production and turnover.",

    "content": "arXiv:2510.16216v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: High-dimensional neural activity often reside in a low-dimensional subspace, referred to as neural manifolds. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a periodic spatial code that are organized near a toroidal manifold, independent of the spatial environment. Due to the periodic nature of its code, it is unclear how the brain utilizes the toroidal manifold to understand its state in a spatial environment. We introduce a novel framework that decodes spatial information from grid cell activity using topology. Our approach uses topological data analysis to extract toroidal coordinates from grid cell population activity and employs path-lifting to reconstruct trajectories in physical space. The reconstructed paths differ from the original by an affine transformation. We validated the method on both continuous attractor network simulations and experimental recordings of grid cells, demonstrating that local trajectories can be reliably reconstructed from a single grid cell module without external position information or training data. These results suggest that co-modular grid cells contain sufficient information for path integration and suggest a potential computational mechanism for spatial navigation.",

    "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
    "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

    "title": "E-Sort: empowering end-to-end neural network for multi-channel spike sorting with transfer learning and fast post-processing",
    "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",

    "title": "PDZD8 deficiency drives lipid accumulation in SNr and dopaminergic disinhibition",
    "content": "The basal ganglia integrate cortical inputs to regulate motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors through precisely balanced inhibitory and excitatory circuits. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) serves as a major output nucleus exerting tonic inhibition over thalamic and midbrain targets. However, how lipid metabolic disturbances affect SNr circuitry and dopaminergic regulation remains unclear. Here, we identify a crucial role for the lipid transport protein PDZD8 in maintaining basal ganglia circuit integrity. PDZD8 deficiency leads to marked lipid and lipofuscin accumulation selectively in the SNr, accompanied by enhanced striatal inhibitory inputs and reduced SNr projections to the ventromedial thalamus (VM) and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (SNc, VTA). This circuit reorganization results in functional disinhibition and hyperactivation of dopaminergic neurons, producing maladaptive reinforcement of striatal inhibition. Our previous findings revealed that PDZD8 deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired fear memory, behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings demonstrate that lipid accumulation in the SNr disrupts inhibitory output and dopaminergic regulation, forming a maladaptive basal ganglia thalamocortical loop. Our study provides the first mechanistic link between lipid metabolic dysfunction, dopaminergic disinhibition, and ADHD like behavioral phenotypes, highlighting PDZD8 as a key regulator of metabolic circuit coupling in the basal ganglia.",

    "title": "Comparative gene editing reduces dopamine receptor levels across rodent species",
    "content": "Translational challenges in neuroscience originate from species-specific differences that limit the generalizability of experimental findings. Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species. Thereby, it supports comparative neuroscience by facilitating the identification of conserved versus species-specific neural mechanisms with enhanced translational potential.",

    "title": "Cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk: Cardiac rhythms reveal maladaptive cerebral autoregulation and constrained ventilatory status",
    "content": "In the context of brain-heart interactions, several pathways have been proposed to mediate feedback loops between neurophysiological oscillations. However, the role of cerebrovascular dynamics in shaping this interplay remains poorly understood. In particular, the interaction between cardiac autonomic control, ventilation mechanisms, and cerebral autoregulation is not well characterized, especially in ageing and post-stroke conditions, where cerebral perfusion is often compromised. In a cohort of 57 elderly participants, including 30 stroke survivors, we investigated the relationship between cardiac sympathetic activity and both, cerebral blood flow regulation and ventilatory status. Sympathetic reflexes, assessed via cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) during sit-to-stand transitions, were preserved across all participants, with no significant group differences between stroke and non-stroke populations. However, among individuals with constrained ventilation, indexed by reduced end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) at baseline, we identified a more elevated CSI following postural change, scaling with the degree of CO2 dysregulation. Furthermore, transcranial Doppler measurements revealed exaggerated changes in mean flow velocity (MFV) within the right middle cerebral artery in most participants. These MFV shifts significantly correlated with the magnitude of cardiac sympathetic change under orthostatic stress, suggesting that CSI can capture maladaptive neurovascular responses. Together, these findings highlight a distinct cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk in elderly individuals, revealing a potential mechanism of compensatory overactivation under impaired cerebrovascular control.",

    "title": "Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 4 Receptive Field Properties in a Balanced Recurrent Spiking Neuronal Network",
    "content": "Understanding how the cortex encodes sensory input in a biologically efficient and computationally robust manner remains a central question in neuroscience. Predictive coding offers a compelling theoretical framework for such cortical processing, but existing models lack the biological detail to fully explain the function of the cortical microcircuits. This study introduces a spiking neural network model of layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1), grounded in predictive coding principles, to clarify how the thalamorecipient layer transforms feedforward input into prediction-error-like signals under realistic excitatory-inhibitory constraints and to yield testable circuit-level predictions. The model integrates structured feedforward input, distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and balanced lateral connectivity to simulate spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity. Network responses are systematically examined under spatially unstructured noise input and structured grating stimuli. Neural membrane potentials encode real-time reconstruction errors between external input and internal estimates, with spikes dynamically correcting these mismatches. The network reproduces hallmark in vivo features, including irregular spontaneous activity, sparse and selective responses, and emergent orientation and phase tuning. Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) balance was maintained across conditions, with inhibitory neurons exhibiting tighter input coupling than excitatory neurons. Furthermore, the network exhibited contrast-dependent modulation of firing rates and E-I balance, dynamically adjusting its activity to changes in input strength. Decoding analyses demonstrates that structured inputs can be robustly reconstructed under moderate noise levels, although decoding fidelity declines sharply under severe corruption. Together, these results suggest that cortical layer 4 may serve as a structured sensory encoding stage in a hierarchical predictive coding system, providing a biologically grounded foundation for modeling prediction error computations in higher cortical areas.",

    "title": "Neuroprotective action of agonists and modulators of A 1 adenosine receptors upon hyperexcitation: mechanism of the antiepileptic activity and role of neuron-glial interaction",
    "content": "Hyperexcitation of neuronal networks is believed to be the main reason for the excitotoxic death of neurons in different central nervous system pathologies, including epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. G i-coupled receptors can be considered as promising targets for the development of new neuroprotectors. Here, we studied the anticonvulsant activity of the agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of A 1 adenosine receptors (A 1 Rs). Our experiments demonstrate that A 1 R agonists, CCPA and N 6-cyclohexyladenosine (N 6-CHA), suppress hyperexcitation in three different in vitro models , including acute glutamate excitotoxicity, NH 4 Cl-and bicuculline-induced epileptiform activity. We have found that the inhibitory action of the agonists is mediated by the activation of not only the neuronal A 1 Rs but also the astrocytic receptors. In astrocytes, A 1 R agonists enhance GABA release, possibly via induction of calcium transients. Using inhibitory analysis, we have demonstrated that G{beta}{gamma}-mediated activation of phospholipase C and subsequent Ca 2+ mobilization from internal stores are essential for generating calcium transients in astrocytes following N 6-CHA application. We have shown first that Ca 2+-dependent activation of protein kinase C, which is involved in the mechanism of GABA release by astrocytes, is a pivotal step in the realization of the antiepileptic action of A 1 R agonists. Moreover, using the model of epileptiform activity induced by GABA A R blockade, we have shown that PAMs, PD81723 and VCP171, also suppress hyperexcitation. Furthermore, using the picrotoxin-induced epilepsy model in mice, we demonstrated that A 1 R agonists exhibit significant anticonvulsant effects and improve animal survival. The PAMs PD81723 and VCP171, when administered one hour before seizure induction, did not significantly affect seizure severity or survival rates. However, chronic administration of VCP171 produced a pronounced anticonvulsant effect and significantly increased survival.. Importantly, PAMs provided therapeutic benefits without significantly affecting overall activity levels in mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that both agonists and PAMs of A 1 R can be considered as potential therapeutic agents with antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity.",

    "content": "Understanding the mechanisms of motor imagery, the mental simulation of movement without execution, is key for the development of neurotechnologies. For instance, for detecting covert motor intent in noncommunicative patients or refining motor commands through brain-computer interfaces. While motor imagery engages motor-related brain regions, its precise mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in relation to cardiac dynamics. Evidence suggests heart-rate variability features have potential to enhance tasks classifications, yet the brain-heart relationship is not well understood. In this study, we examined motor imagery learning using a task involving right-hand grasping imagery. We found that motor imagery is correlated with a cardiac sympathetic uncoupling with directed connectivity within the motor cortex. Additionally, cerebellar-supplementary motor area segregation, in relation to cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed longitudinal motor learning. These results suggest that varying patterns of heart rhythmicity and brain connectivity within the motor network actively change during motor imagery, suggesting the brain-heart axis as influencer of sensorimotor function and associated neuroplasticity of learning.",

    "title": "Asymmetries in hue measured behaviorally and with visual evoked potentials",
    "content": "Hue percepts vary more rapidly along some directions in color space (e.g. near yellow) than others (e.g. near green) with corresponding differences in the size or stimulus range of different hue categories. The basis for these differences is not known. We examined whether the asymmetries are present in early cortical color coding by comparing the strength of hue differences using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from occipital cortex. Stimuli were spatial gratings with a fixed nominal contrast in the cone-opponent plane that varied sinusoidally in hue rather than saturation. The responses to different levels of hue separation were measured by the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signals and also in behavioral measurements employing a contrast matching task. For both, the same separation in hue angle resulted in stronger responses for angular differences centered on the yellow quadrant of the cone-opponent space. Responses were also larger for the yellow than blue quadrant, ruling out a general sensitivity loss to the blue-yellow axis as the basis for the differences. The responses differences paralleled the asymmetries in the rates of change in color appearance based on analyses of previous measures of hue scaling functions. The presence of these asymmetries in the VEP responses suggests that they arise relatively early in the cortical sensory representation of color rather than emerging late as a product of inference or color category learning.",

    "title": "Memory recall errors reflect interacting sensory and mnemonic representations",
    "content": "Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance of information that is no longer present in the environment. Some accounts propose that WM is supported by abstract representations so that new sensory inputs do not interfere with existing memories. Others posit that early sensory representations are recruited to maintain memory precision, potentially at the cost of interference caused by new inputs. Here we tested these accounts using an orientation recall task to determine whether memory errors reflect interacting representations of sensory and mnemonic information. We found that adding noise to the memoranda and presenting feature-neutral distractors independently increased recall errors. However, distractors that shared a feature with remembered stimuli led to systematic attractive biases such that memory errors were pulled toward the orientation of the distractor. The magnitude of this bias was modulated by both stimulus noise and whether the distractor was behaviorally relevant. Our results demonstrate that while working memory can utilize abstract representations, it remains susceptible to feature-specific sensory interference, suggesting partial reliance on sensory-like codes.",

    "title": "Nuclear receptor-neurotransmitter coupling links behavior to metabolic state",
    "content": "Animals must flexibly respond to environmental stimuli to survive, and optimal responses critically depend on the organism's current needs. Many organisms have evolved both cell-intrinsic and intertissue signaling pathways that integrate metabolic status. However, how this information is encoded in molecular signals is currently not well understood. Here we show that the nematode C. elegans employs lipidated neurohormones that combine the neurotransmitter octopamine and fat metabolism-derived building blocks to relay information about lipid metabolic status and drive inhibition of aversive olfactory responses during food removal. Using targeted metabolomics, we show that lipidated neurohormone synthesis requires the carboxylesterase CEST-2.1, which links octopamine-glucosides with endogenous methyl-branched or diet-derived cyclopropane fatty acids that act as agonists of the nuclear receptor and master regulator of fat metabolism, NHR-49/PPAR. Loss of cest-2.1, loss of bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid production, or loss of endogenous biosynthesis of the methyl-branched fatty acid substrates of CEST-2.1 mimics the behavioral responses of animals lacking octopamine, indicating that regulation of neurotransmitter-dependent behavior is linked to the coordination of fat metabolism via NHR-49/PPAR. Biosynthesis and subsequent neuromodulation via lipidated neurohormone relies on an intertissue trafficking pathway in which octopamine is shuttled first into the intestine where it is chemically modified, which is likely followed by neuronal import and intracellular hydrolysis to finally release free octopamine. We propose that esterase-dependent synthesis and subsequent hydrolysis of lipidated neurohormones represents a chemical encoding mechanism by which animals integrate information from neurotransmitter signaling and lipid homeostasis to direct appropriate behaviors.",

    "title": "Voluntary Dissociation of Motor Unit Activity in the Vastii Muscles",
    "content": "The CNS coordinates movement through consistent activation patterns across muscles and motor units, suggesting the presence of a relatively fixed and high-dimensional number of neural constraints on voluntary actions. In the human quadriceps, the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) control the knee extensor torque and are considered a synergistic pair largely activated by shared neural inputs. However, some evidence suggests that these muscles, or even subregions within them, can be controlled independently. In this study, we investigated whether humans can dissociate neural input to VM and VL during isometric contractions. Ten participants received real-time feedback from multiple intramuscular EMG electrodes that targeted different regions of the VM and VL while attempting to activate each muscle or sub-regions selectively. We found that nine out of ten subjects were able to clearly separate VM and VL activity based on the intramuscular EMG feedback. However, motor unit decomposition from the intramuscular EMGs revealed that selective recruitment of a unique set of motor units was possible only within the proximal region of VM. In contrast, VL and distal VM showed highly correlated activation, indicating tight functional coupling. Correlation analyses confirmed that the proximal VM exhibited distinct activation profiles compared with both distal VM and VL, supporting the existence of compartmentalized control within VM. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to dissociate the activation of motor units within this synergistic muscle group during low-force isometric contractions.",

    "title": "Parkinson's disease risk factors are expressed at brain barriers.",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but whether its etiology is cell autonomous remains unclear. Increasing evidence implicates the blood-central nervous system (CNS) barriers in disease development, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic risk factors linked to cells forming the cerebrovasculature to advance this emerging area of research. The objective of this study is to identify PD genetic risk factors associated with blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers, and to validate protein localization in human tissue and experimental models. To do so, we integrated genome-wide association studies and single nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets from the human postmortem substantia nigra (SN), midbrain, or cortical samples from control and PD donors. An in-depth bioinformatics analysis identified genes enriched in cell types that form the multicellular architecture of brain barriers, including CAVIN2, ANXA1, ANO2, and LRP1B. We further validated whether corresponding proteins were present in cell types associated with the blood-CNS barriers in human and mouse post-mortem tissues, as well as in iPSC-differentiated cells and choroid plexus organoids. Results showed that quantifying the proportion of endothelial cells expressing PD-related genes was under-evaluated at the transcript level compared to immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we observed that CAVIN2 and ANXA1 proteins were more abundant at the vasculature of the substantia nigra vs. cortex, and CAVIN2 protein levels were reduced in PD vs. control human postmortem tissues. In contrast, the investigation of mouse postmortem samples demonstrated that the CAVIN2 protein is only present in a subset of mouse blood vessels, compared to nearly all vessels in human tissue. Similarly, mouse ANXA1 protein localizes to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and not at the vasculature, as seen in human tissue. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of PD-relevant risk genes specifically expressed at brain barriers and enriched in PD-relevant brain regions. The secondary outcome is the demonstration of poor transcript-protein correlation in - at least - a subset of PD risk factors, and a low interspecies conservation of protein localization for the selected candidates. In conclusion, the BBB and BCSFB may represent understudied contributors to PD, endothelial-specific proteins appear differentially regulated compared to transcripts, and experimental models require comprehensive validation to ensure relevance to the human condition.",

    "content": "New viral approaches have revolutionized neuroscience by precisely delivering genes in neurons; for example, to control or monitor activity in specific neuronal cell types. In contrast, the manipulation of oli-godendrocytes requires the Cre-LoxP system and gene-by-gene engineering, breeding, and genotyping. Here we introduce OASIS (Oligodendrocyte AAV-CRISPR mediated Specific In vivo editing System), a ver-satile platform that combines SELECTIV, an AAV-receptor-based transduction strategy, with HiUGE, an NHEJ-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach. We show efficient and specific oligodendrocyte trans-duction across the brain and tagging of endogenous cytoskeletal, myelin, cell adhesion, scaffolding, and junctional proteins. OASIS enables sparse yet reliable labeling, allowing direct visualization of subcellular protein localization with single-cell resolution. We successfully fused the biotin-ligase TurboID with endogenous oligodendroglial Neurofascin-155, thereby achieving targeted biotinylation of the axoglial junction.

    "title": "Pro-endometriosis macrophage release of IL-33 is key for endometriosis pain and lesion formation",
    "content": "Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease affecting up to 10% of females. When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.",

    "title": "Spatial learning in multi-scale environments: Roles of hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex",
    "content": "Navigation cognition involves the learning of multi-scale environments and the formation of cognitive maps. How do humans build cognitive maps in multi-scale environments? Cognitive maps are thought to be organized hierarchically, with local representations for subareas and global representations for the entire environment. However, it remains unclear how spatial learning influences the representations of multi-scale environments and their underlying neural mechanisms across different levels of representation. In the current study, we built a virtual environment (VE) with four orthogonally positioned rectangular rooms, each containing eight objects at the corners. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a four-session spatial memory experiment conducted over two weeks. We measured their brain activity by using BOLD-fMRI at two stages: pre-learning stage and post-learning, when they were judging the relative direction between the objects within the VE. We found that with the progression of learning, the subjects shifted from relying on local, directional cues to using more global representations of the environment. At the neural level, the hippocampus (HIP), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) played distinct roles in encoding spatial information across the two learning stages. Specifically, after learning, the HIP shifted from local to global representations, while the RSC and OFC supported the integration of spatial information across these representational levels. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex was involved in forming global representations, facilitating efficient spatial processing as learning advanced. These findings revealed how spatial learning leads to adaptive shifts in brain activity, contributing to the formation of cognitive maps in complex, multi-scale environments.",

    "title": "Visual Attention in Peripersonal Space",
    "content": "Bringing the hand near a visual stimulus enhances visual processing. This effect is linked to peripersonal space (PPS), the body-centered region where visual and proprioceptive information interact. Despite extensive behavioral evidence, the neural basis of this interaction in early visual cortex remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how hand proximity modulates orientation selectivity in area V2 by recording single-neuron responses from two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys performed a fixation task while their hand was positioned near a visual stimulus while either being visible or occluded, and compared with when the hand was away from the stimulus. When the near hand was visible, neural firing rates in V2 were significantly higher, accompanied by sharper orientation tuning. In contrast, occluding the hand broadened orientation tuning compared to when the hand was away. These effects emerged rapidly after stimulus onset and were coherent across the population, demonstrating that PPS is actively prioritized during visual processing. Together, the findings reveal two complementary (feedback) signals in V2: a congruence-driven enhancement when visual and proprioceptive inputs align, and a mismatch-driven suppression when they conflict, indicating that V2 integrates multisensory cues to encode PPS and support action-relevant visual processing.",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "THE HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA SH-SY5Y CELL LINE AS A MODEL TO ASSESS \u03b2-AMYLOID NEUROTOXICITY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS",
    "content": "The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line is widely used as an in vitro model of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the lack of standardized protocols for assessing A{beta} toxicity - including differentiation strategies for SH-SY5Y cells - limits the comparability of results across studies. To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate how methodological factors influence A{beta}-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. We included 359 eligible studies encompassing 1,192 MTT-based comparisons of cell viability between A{beta}-treated and control SH-SY5Y cells. A three-level meta-analysis estimated mean cell viability after A{beta} exposure at 63% of control levels (95% CI [61.6; 64.3]), with very high heterogeneity (I2=99.6%). Meta-regression identified significant associations between increased toxicity and higher A{beta} concentrations, longer exposure durations, and the use of peptide preparations described as fibrils. Conversely, differentiation protocols, duration, and cell density did not significantly influence toxicity outcomes. Reporting quality was often poor, with frequent omissions regarding cell line origin, authentication, contamination testing, A{beta} preparation details and nature of the experimental unit. Overall, our findings show robust A{beta} toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, primarily driven by dose, exposure time, and A{beta} aggregation state, but not cell differentiation status. Our conclusions highlight the critical need for better reporting of A{beta} exposure parameters to enhance reproducibility and translational potential in AD research.",

    "content": "Reactive astrogliosis in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) involves profound changes in the morphology, metabolism and secretion profile of astrocytes, but whether astrogliosis is beneficial or harmful, and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here we report an unexpected neuroprotective function of death receptor p75NTR in astrocytes through its ability to regulate cholesterol metabolism. AD knock-in mice expressing signaling-deficient p75NTR variants in astrocytes showed enhanced Abeta burden, brain histopathology and cognitive impairment, even when variants were introduced late in the disease process. Astrocytes expressing dysfunctional p75NTR variants showed impaired uptake of Abeta oligomers, and their conditioned medium enhanced Abeta production in AD neurons. p75NTR signaling negatively regulated astrocyte cholesterol biosynthesis and secretion, while cholesterol depletion restored Abeta uptake in mutant astrocytes and reduced Abeta production in AD neurons. In agreement with the role of astrocyte-derived cholesterol, statin treatment reverted the effects of astrocyte p75NTR mutants on AD neuropathology. Thus, although neuronal p75NTR has been widely recognized to amplify AD, astrocyte p75NTR plays a neuroprotective role.",

    "content": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that enables in vivo evaluation of white matter microstructure, providing sensitivity to tissue abnormalities caused by disease. Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and axonal damage in the optic nerve, leading to degeneration along the entire visual pathway. This degeneration includes secondary effects on fiber crossings within the optic chiasm, which are challenging to characterize with conventional diffusion models. In this study, we evaluated 31 patients with asymmetric glaucoma and 31 healthy controls using advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging methods, including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, multi-tensor fit via Multi-Resolution Discrete Search method, and Fixel-Based Analysis. We found significant differences of diffusion metrics in white matter tracts of the visual system, including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic radiations. Moreover, diffusion metrics correlated with clinical ophthalmological parameters such as cup-to-disc ratio, visual field mean deviation, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. These findings support the use of advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging models as sensitive tools for detecting Wallerian degeneration and resolving complex white matter architecture in the human visual pathway, and demonstrate their utility to study other fiber-crossing regions throughout the brain.",

    "content": "Background Alcohol misuse increases Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, however the mechanisms linking these conditions are unknown. In rodents, chronic and acute ethanol increases amyloid-[beta] (A[beta]), however those studies have been limited to a single sex or brain region. Objective This study explored how adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE), alters A[beta] in multiple regions of the brain in female and male TgF344-AD rats as they age. Methods From P28-P58, female and male TgF344-AD rats were administered either water (CON) or 5.0 g/kg ethanol (AIE; 20% ethanol w/v) via intragastric gavage on a 2-day on/off cycle. In Experiment 1, A[beta] was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) in 6- and 10-month-old rats. In Experiment 2, in vivo microdialysis was used in 3-month-old female rats to measure how ethanol directly modulates A[beta]; levels in the dHPC. Results In the OFC, PC, EC, vHPC, and dHPC, A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 was higher in 6-month-old female TgF344-AD rats compared to males. However, at 10 months A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 levels were only elevated in the dHPC of AIE-treated females, compared to all other groups. An acute ethanol challenge at 3 months selectively evoked a sustained increase in ISF A[beta]40 levels in AIE-treated females. Conclusions In aged females, the dHPC is a region sensitive to ethanol-associated A[beta] pathology. This may be due to disruptions in A{beta} clearance in early life, which may have an additive effect on A[beta] aggregation over the lifespan.",

    "content": "Menopause is linked to cognitive decline and reduced brain metabolism, while estrogen (E2) therapy has been shown to mitigate these effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which ovarian hormones and E2 influence neuroprotection is essential for developing strategies to maintain brain health in women. In this study, we examined how the loss of ovarian hormones, with or without E2 treatment, affects the brain proteome and mitochondrial energy production in aged female C57BL/6J mice (36-40 weeks). The mice underwent sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgery and were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks; six weeks after surgery, OVX mice received either sesame oil or E2 treatment for four weeks. Proteomic analysis of brain homogenates revealed 4,992 proteins regulated by E2, with pathway analysis showing increased signaling proteins related to synaptogenesis. OVX reduced proteins involved in synaptic function, branched-chain amino acid and ketone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (Complexes I, IV, and V), while E2 restored protein expression within these pathways. Despite alterations in OxPhos proteins, basal and state 3 mitochondrial respiration remained unchanged, although notable impairments to Complex IV enzymatic activity were apparent in OVX, but not following E2 replacement. Overall, these results indicate that E2 supports brain health by maintaining proteins crucial for synaptic integrity and metabolism, and by reducing the decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with menopause.",

    "title": "TDP-43 dysfunction leads to impaired proteostasis and predisposes mice to worse neurological outcomes after brain injury",
    "content": "Background: Pathological TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) dysfunction is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration is poorly understood and likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigated the synergistic interplay between TDP-43 dysfunction and TBI in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: A model of TDP-43 dysfunction caused by a knock-in Q331K mutation in Tardbp was combined with a mild model of TBI. Control conditions included both WT mice and mice with sham surgery. Animals were evaluated for behavioral deficits at timepoints pre- and post-surgery. Additionally, post-mortem brain tissues were examined using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics together with histological and biochemical analyses. Results: Expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 in vivo caused deficits in multiple branches of the proteostasis network, including protein folding, protein synthesis, and protein turnover. Examples include mis-expression of chaperones and genes within the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in mutant TDP-43 versus WT mice. Further, mutant TDP-43 expression correlated with reduced thermostability of proteins associated with the ribosome and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex. In response to TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibited significantly worse neurological outcomes relative to WT animals. Heightened neurological deficits in mutant TDP-43 mice following TBI coincided with a robust upregulation of proteostasis- and stress-related genes at the transcript level. However, this upregulation was not detected at the protein level. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 leads to deficits within the proteostasis network in vivo at baseline. Despite an upregulation of proteostasis-related genes at the transcript level in mutant TDP-43 mice after TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibit an impaired response to, and recovery from, brain trauma relative to their WT counterparts. Restoring proteostasis is expected to protect against the detrimental effects of TDP-43 dysfunction, especially under stress conditions that promote neurodegenerative disease.",

    "content": "Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in vivo offers a powerful tool to investigate pain mechanisms. We validated the use of conditional knock-in mouse model expressing Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR associated protein 9 selectively in sensory neurons by crossing with Scn10a-Cre driver. Transgene expression was confirmed in key tissues including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sciatic nerve. To assess in vivo editing efficacy, RNA guides targeting GFP or TRPV1 were intrathecally administered. A dose of micrograms of RNA guides significantly reduced GFP expression, and two rounds of nanoparticle delivery targeting TRPV1 resulted in ~65% reduction in DRG and ~55% in sciatic nerve without triggering caspase-3-mediated apoptosis or motor deficits. Edited animals exhibited increased withdrawal latencies to heat and reduced nocifensive behaviors following capsaicin injection. Their responses to capsaicin-evoked thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were diminished. This approach enables rapid and efficient sensory neuron-specific CRISPR/Cas9 gene perturbations for pain research in mice. We envisage that this method can be employed both for the exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying nociception and for the validation of therapeutic targets associated with pain.",

    "title": "Circadian and Sleep-Wake Modulation of Functional Connectivity Across Brain Oscillations and States Linked to Cognition in Humans",
    "content": "Sleep and circadian rhythms both contribute to cognitive performance, but the underlying neuronal network-level changes remain unclear. We quantified the contribution of brain state, sleep-pressure dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle, and circadian rhythmicity to electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) and examined how these network changes relate to cognition. Thirty-four healthy adults completed a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol to uncouple sleep-wake and endogenous circadian rhythms. From over 1,200 hours of artifact-free EEG, we derived phase-coupling metrics to quantify FC across brain states, thirds-of-the-night (sleep pressure), and circadian phase, and related these network measures to a range of cognitive performance indices. FC differed markedly between brain states, especially in the alpha and sigma bands, and was modulated by sleep history and circadian phase. Principal component analysis revealed both a global and a topographically distributed FC component which responded differentially to sleep pressure. Dissipation of sleep pressure was accompanied by increasing global FC in NREM sleep, and especially in the delta, sigma and beta frequencies, and decreasing global FC in the alpha band. During REM sleep, global FC decreased in nearly all frequency bands with dissipation of sleep pressure. The influence of circadian phase on FC was smaller than that of sleep pressure and varied across brain states. Lower global theta-band FC in NREM and alpha-band FC during wake predicted better alertness and working memory accuracy, an effect modulated by circadian phase. These results suggest that sleep homeostasis and circadian timing interact to stabilize functional brain connectivity in wakefulness, thereby supporting optimal cognitive function.",

    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

Still early days, but happy to share the repo if folks are interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard_Career_8603\"> /u/Standard_Career_8603 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1obprx2/building_an_opensource_observability_tool_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1obprx2/building_an_opensource_observability_tool_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Selective motor stimulation of the pudendal nerve using multi-contact cuff electrodes: a pre-clinical study in feline and ovine models",
    "content": "Introduction: Pudendal nerve stimulation is a promising therapy for urinary incontinence, however stimulation can evoke off-target activity. We aimed to determine whether multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively recruit motor fibers of the pudendal nerve trunk in preclinical feline and ovine models. Methods: Multi-contact cuff electrodes were implanted around the pudendal nerve in anesthetized felines and ovines. Structured variations in electrode contact configurations and stimulation amplitudes were applied to evoke external urethral sphincter (EUS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) pressure responses. We calculated selectivity indices, EUS Scores, and EAS Scores to quantify selective recruitment and the magnitude of evoked pressure changes. Results: We achieved selective motor activation, with preferential recruitment of the EUS or EAS in all three feline experiments and one of three ovine experiments. In felines, at least four electrode combinations selectively evoked EUS responses (EUS Score 0.5) and at least one combination targeted the EAS. In ovines, one EUS-selective and six EAS-selective combinations obtained comparable scores. In preliminary tests, we observed functional increases in leak point pressure and incontinence prevention with selective stimulation. Conclusions: This study shows that multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively activate EUS and EAS motor fibers in the pudendal nerve. Future work should focus on optimizing stimulation parameters to enhance selectivity and assess the translational potential of this approach for restoring pelvic organ control.",

    "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "title": "Revisiting the explicit-implicit additivity assumption in visuomotor adaptation",
    "content": "Explicit aiming strategies have been shown to play an important role in visuomotor adaptation, enabling rapid improvements in performance and affording flexibility, but their interaction and downstream consequences on implicit recalibration processes remain hotly debated. While early work assumed these processes combined additively, recent studies have challenged this view. However, these studies may have overlooked subtle spatial and temporal dynamics, which could influence how explicit aiming and implicit recalibration interact. Recent research shows that implicit recalibration anchors to where a person aims their movements, with aiming strategies directly shaping their spatial development. Moreover, implicit recalibration operates across multiple timescales, with both temporally volatile and persistent components. To examine whether these factors mask the true relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration, we conducted a visuomotor rotation task while carefully accounting for the interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics. After controlling for spatial dynamics (plan-based generalization) and temporal dynamics (forgetting), we found a strong relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration. Despite finding this strong relationship, it appears to be sub-additive, which may result from simple methodological imprecision, the operation of additional but unobserved processes, or more complex nonlinear interactions between processes.",

In two studies, we examined the effects of experimental interventions known to affect ghrelin levels on human risky choice in healthy male participants, either after a brief fasting period (study 1, N=37; N=26 for fMRI analyses) or a single night of total sleep deprivation (study 2, N=40; N=36 for fMRI analyses). We found no credible effects of the experimental manipulations on the proportion of risky choices. In addition, computational modelling indicated that the standard prospect theory, without accounting for choice repetition, best described the observed behaviour. However, it did not reveal consistent effects of state manipulations on model parameters, and the inclusion of manipulation-induced changes in ghrelin levels in the model likewise revealed no robust associations. FMRI analyses did not reveal effects of state manipulation on neural signatures of subjective value or choice in a priori defined regions of interest (bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex for subjective value; bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum, and right medial prefrontal cortex for choice). Our results suggest that state-dependent influences on risky decision-making may be weaker than previously thought.",

    "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

    "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
    "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",

    "title": "Largely Intact But Less Reliable and Distributed Neural Representations of Subjective Value in Human Opioid Addiction",
    "content": "<p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>",

Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance \"phee\" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

    "title": "Prenatal Downregulation of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors in the Mouse Prefrontal Cortex Disrupts Cortical Lamination and Induces a Transcriptional Signature Associated with Social Interaction Deficits",
    "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

    "title": "Layer 6 Corticothalamic Neurons Induce High Gamma Oscillations Through Cortico-cortical and Cortico-thalamo-cortical Pathways",
    "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of NDQ (NDQ-CV) have been shown to be satisfactory in the general population of Chinese adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. A total of 536 patients with psychiatric disorders aged 10\u201319 years old were recruited from Shandong Mental Health Center in China between October 2021 and March 2022. A structured questionnaire including NDQ-CV was used to measure nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the factor structure of NDQ-CV in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. The mean age of the participants was 15.30 \u00b1 1.95, and 61% was female. Fifty-two percent of participants were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the revised one-factor model was most suitable to interpret the structure of NDQ-CV. The internal consistency reliability coefficient was 0.94. The total scale score was significantly correlated with nightmare frequency, gender, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were significant differences in NDQ-CV total scores between adolescents with psychiatric disorders and the general adolescent population. The NDQ-CV has satisfactory reliability and validity and is suitable to assess nightmare distress in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to investigate the psychometric properties of NDQ-CV in clinical and healthy adult populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

We aim to (a) induce flying dreams in an adult population using a custom-built robotic bed, (b) probe their phenomenological correlates, and (c) open targeted dream incubation experiences up to a large public in an art museum setting. To our knowledge, this is a unique and novel approach where scientists collaborate with artists to incubate dreams with the priority being the joy of the incubated dream rather than a particular scientific hypothesis. In total, 353 museumgoers slept in the Dream Hotel Room 1 for either a 1 hr nap period or overnight; of these, 24 submitted voluntary dream reports, with 16 visitors (67%) reporting at least one dreamt experience of flight. This is higher than baseline frequencies in adult populations reported in prior literature. Participants reported visual, auditory, vestibular, and somatosensory flying dream content. These findings may facilitate the development of dream flight induction technologies, as well as novel artist\u2013scientist collaboration methodologies across the brain sciences.

    "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

    "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",

    "title": "Benchmarking resting state fMRI connectivity pipelines for classification: Robust accuracy despite processing variability in cross-site eye state prediction",
    "content": "The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) methods has yielded promising results in human brain neuroscience. However, the reproducibility of ML applications in neuroimaging remains limited, challenging the generalizability of inferences to broader populations. In addition to the inherent variability of the brain activity (both in healthy and pathological states), poor reproducibility is further enhanced by inconsistencies in data preprocessing techniques and methods for calculating functional connectivity (FC), which are used as parameters for brain state classification. To systematically assess the impact of abovementioned factors on ML applications to fMRI data, we benchmarked a comprehensive set of FC analysis pipelines for the classification task between fMRI data recorded in two fundamentally different states: eyes open and eyes closed. In contrast to studies involving heterogeneous clinical populations or using complex cognitive tasks, our controlled experimental design - based on two independent datasets of healthy participants collected in different laboratories - minimizes variability related to a task design or pathological brain states. Classification accuracy and reproducibility were compared for 192 distinct FC analysis pipelines, covering common preprocessing approaches, brain parcellation schemes, and connectivity metrics. Notably, we employed a cross-site validation strategy, training predictive models on data from one site and testing them on the other. Despite the substantial variability in pipeline configurations, we observed consistently high classification accuracy (~80%), confirming that FC-based models can robustly discriminate between well-defined brain states (eye conditions) across different acquisition sites. Best results both in terms of classification accuracy and stability were observed using Pearson correlation and tangent correlation as FC, Brainnetome as atlas, and confound regression strategies based on the CompCor method. These findings highlight the resilience of rs-fMRI FC-derived characteristics to methodological variation and support their utility in the discovery of biomarkers, particularly in settings that involve stable and reproducible brain states.",

    "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
    "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",

    "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "India is a profoundly diverse nation-state where constitutional provisions for two official and 22 Scheduled languages overlay a vast substratum of numerous Non-Scheduled languages and over a thousand distinct mother tongues, creating a rich and layered linguistic hierarchy. The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1. We also find that the understanding of \u201cheritage language\u201d needs to be more nuanced in this particular context of multilingualism and language acquisition.",

The results indicated that fragmentation proneness and distress were both significantly related to nightmares. Fragmentation proneness, but not distress, accounted for significant independent variance in nightmares after accounting for age and gender. These results suggest that self-fragmentation may play a role in experiencing nightmares and potentially partly explain the relationship between distress and nightmares.

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

Over the years I've cobbled together aliases and bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways I couldn't manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which lets you go to any point in your repo's time and provides simple undo and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn't mean to rebase, etc.<p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the VCS. There's some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and there's one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of a GUI around how JJ works.<p>Right now, Judo for JJ is an MVP in an open beta. I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though there's many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from the Beta.<p>I'm really grateful for the great community JJ has built, alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I've read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar to many of the great products that are out there for git.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45645120\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45645120</a></p>\n<p>Points: 124</p>\n<p># Comments: 31</p>",

We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
    "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. </p> <h1>Core Architecture:</h1> <p>The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the <strong>Write Ahead Log (WAL)</strong> for durability, an in-memory <strong>Memtable</strong> (using <code>SortedDict</code> for sorted writes), and immutable persistent <strong>SSTables (Sorted String Tables)</strong>.</p> <p>Some features that I'm proud of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Async Compaction</strong>: Merging and compaction are handled by a <strong>separate background worker thread</strong>. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.</li> <li><strong>Client/Server Model</strong>: The entire storage engine runs behind a <strong>FastAPI server</strong>. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.</li> <li><strong>Efficient Range Queries</strong>: Added full support for range queries from <code>start_key</code> to <code>end_key</code>. This is achieved via a memory-efficient <strong>k-way merge iterator</strong> that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a <code>StreamingResponse</code> to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.</li> <li><strong>Bloom Filter</strong>: Implemented a <strong>Bloom Filter</strong> for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.</li> <li><strong>Binary Storage</strong>: SSTables now use <strong>Msgpack binary format</strong> instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.</li> </ul> <p>My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/\">Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks</a>. This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.</p> <h1>Get Started</h1> <pre><code>pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store </code></pre> <p><strong>Usage via CLI/Server:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Terminal 1 (Server):</strong> <code>lsm-server</code></li> <li><strong>Terminal 2 (Client):</strong> <code>lsm-cli</code> (Follow the CLI help for commands).</li> </ol> <h1>Looking for Feedback</h1> <p>I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.</p> <p>Repo link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Shashank1985/storage-engine\">Shashank1985/storage-engine</a><br /> Thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vollhard-natta\"> /u/vollhard-natta </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oborib/i_built_a_persistent_kv_store_in_pure_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oborib/i_built_a_persistent_kv_store_in_pure_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization.

    "content": "Objective. Analysis tools for peripheral nerve recordings remain underdeveloped compared to those for brain signals, limiting the advancement of nerve neurotechnologies for clinical treatments such as closed-loop systems. This study introduces and explores the performance of two novel nerve signal analysis techniques\u2014cross-correlation analysis and spike delay velocity analysis\u2014which rely on a defining feature of peripheral nerve signals: the reliable conduction velocity of signals transmitted by axons in nerves. Approach. We test the capabilities of the introduced cross-correlation and spike delay velocity analysis techniques both in silico on synthetic nerve signals and on in vivo nerve signals acquired from freely-moving rats. Main results. Our findings show that both techniques can be successfully employed to extract transmission direction and velocity information from compact two-electrode site peripheral nerve recording designs. Notably, cross-correlation analysis can be employed to detect neural signals of very low signal-to-noise ratio, otherwise undetectable by typical spike detection approaches. Significance. Our findings provide new techniques to both enhance detection and extract new information in the form of velocity data from nerve recordings using a compact two-electrode site recording setup. Unlike traditional methods, this design eliminates the need for long electrode arrays, making it particularly well-suited for use in freely-moving animal models and translational applications. As axon signal conduction direction and velocity are tightly linked to neural function, these techniques can support new research into peripheral nervous system function and new therapeutic approaches driven by neural interfaces.",

    "content": "Objective. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG signals. Approach. We propose Background EEG Transform (BGTransform), a principled data augmentation framework that leverages the neurophysiological dissociation between task-related activity and ongoing background EEG. In contrast to existing methods, BGTransform generates new trials by selectively perturbing the background EEG component while preserving the task-related signal, thus enabling controlled variability without compromising class-discriminative features. We applied BGTransform to three publicly available EEG-BCI datasets spanning steady-state visual evoked potential and P300 paradigms. The effectiveness of BGTransform is evaluated using several widely adopted neural decoding models under three training regimes: (1) without augmentation (baseline model), (2) with conventional augmentation methods, and (3) with BGTransform. Main results. Across all datasets and model architectures, BGTransform consistently outperformed both baseline models and conventional augmentation techniques. Compared to models trained without BGTransform, it achieved average classification accuracy improvements of 2.45%\u201315.52%, 4.36%\u201317.15% and 7.55%\u201310.47% across the three datasets, respectively. In addition, BGTransform demonstrated greater robustness across subjects and tasks, maintaining stable performance under varying recording conditions. Significance. BGTransform provides a principled and effective approach to augmenting EEG data, informed by neurophysiological insight. By preserving task-related components and introducing controlled variability, the method addresses the challenge of data sparsity in EEG-BCI training. These findings support the utility of BGTransform for improving the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of deep learning models in neural engineering applications.",

Despite the comparable ability to extract more abstract cognitive signals from the brain, little effort has been devoted to leveraging these signals in neuro-engineering applications. In this study, we explore the use of neural signals related to economic value, a key cognitive construct, in a BMI context. Approach. Using multivariate time series data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices in a value-based decision-making task. We implement a reinforcement learning-based training approach to develop adaptive decoders that can be extended to handle multi-step decisions, which frequently arise in real-world settings. Main results. We develop neural decoders leveraging subjective value signals to predict the monkeys\u2019 choices with accuracy on average, with above-chance accuracy even when choice options are objectively equal. We show that this same decoder architecture can be trained to execute choice-related actions and execute action sequences aligned with the user\u2019s goal. Finally, we explore a decoder architecture that uses a neural forecasting model equipped with task-related information, and show that it makes high accuracy predictions \u2009ms sooner than would otherwise be possible. Significance. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuro-engineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals to aid users in goal-directed behavior. They suggest that using abstract cognitive signals in real-world settings may be more accurate when combined with information from multiple sources, such as motor and sensory regions. This research also highlights the potential need for systems to measure their confidence in their actions when user input is minimal.",

    "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

    "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
    "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder.

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state.

    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

    "title": "Early contingency information enhances human punishment sensitivity when punishment is frequent but not rare.",
    "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Astrocyte dysfunction within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been increasingly implicated in maladaptive reward processing and the development of addiction-like behaviors. In this study, we investigated how impairing astrocyte calcium signaling in the NAc core influences consummatory reward behaviors and reward valuation. Using a viral approach to express the human plasma membrane calcium ATPase (hPMCA) in NAc core astrocytes in male rats, we selectively reduced intracellular astrocyte calcium dynamics. Blunting astrocyte calcium signaling led to increased self-administration of both sucrose and cocaine on a low effort fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Behavioral economic analysis revealed enhanced reward motivation and valuation in hPMCA-expressing rats as compared to controls. Notably, reduction of astrocyte calcium signaling did not alter cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, indicating a dissociation between astrocytic regulation of reward valuation and other cocaine-related behaviors. Collectively, these results identify astrocyte calcium dynamics in the NAc core as a key constraint on motivational drive and reward valuation.",

    "title": "Structural specialization of mossy fiber boutons is necessary for their unique computational functions",
    "content": "Sparsely active granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) project onto CA3 pyramidal neurons through mossy fibers (MF), forming a feedforward network that ensures even similar inputs activate distinct and minimally overlapping populations of CA3 neurons. This process, known as pattern separation, is a key computational feature at this synapse. However, such sparse activity and connectivity increase the risk of information loss, as multiple presynaptic inputs are typically required to elicit a postsynaptic action potential. Interestingly, MF synapses exhibit robust short-term plasticity (STP), enabling a dynamic increase in release probability during brief bursts of presynaptic activity. This mechanism ensures that a short, high-frequency burst from a single granule cell can reliably generate a spike in its postsynaptic CA3 target. Unlike other hippocampal synapses, MF boutons are large, with multiple active zones, each coupled to a cluster of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). MF boutons also possess a large readily releasable pool of vesicles. The functional consequences of this unusual synaptic design remain largely unexplored. In fact, the MF synapse is often depicted as a synapse with multiple sites, each behaving as an independent transmission line, analogous to several CA3 boutons contacting a single CA1 dendrite. We developed a physiologically realistic spatial model of the MF bouton to investigate how its peculiar structural and functional properties affect synaptic signaling and plasticity. Contrary to earlier assumptions, our computational model revealed, release sites are not independent transmission units. Crosstalk between calcium domains is necessary for the observed strong STP and for the timely activation of CA3 neurons. VDCCs in the MF bouton are only loosely coupled to active zones, and the distance between active zones is relatively large. In addition to the synaptic design and the known role of calbindin-D28k and synaptotagmin-7 in STP, we find that loose coupling of VDCCs to active zones and large inter-AZ distances are crucial. These features keep the basal release probability low, and their combined action is required to generate the facilitation that triggers postsynaptic action potentials in response to bursts filtering out non-informative dentate activity, and provides a strong rationale for the mossy fiber's synaptic architecture.",

    "content": "In the human brain, substance clearance is intimately connected to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its flow. CSF extends from the lateral ventricles (LVs) to the parenchyma's perivascular spaces. Macroscopic undulating CSF flow is present during both wakefulness and sleep and can be experimentally induced. However, the mechanisms generating this flow and its contribution to brain clearance remain unclear. Using fMRI and PET across various conditions, we demonstrate that LV-volume oscillations drive undulating CSF flow in the ventricles and subarachnoid basal cisternae. LV oscillations are driven by cortical blood-volume changes induced by neuronal activity, heartbeat and respiration. LV oscillations' amplitudes determine PET-tracer clearance from the LVs. Conclusively, induced by extra- and intracranial physiological drivers and mediated by cortical blood-volume changes, LV-volume oscillations drive macroscopic CSF flow and clearance.",

    "content": "Short association fibers (SAFs) form the local scaffold of cortical connectivity, supporting early functional specialization and marking sites of neurodevelopmental vulnerability. However, their development before birth remains largely unknown. Leveraging advanced fetal diffusion MRI and a histology-validated framework, we present the first in-utero reconstruction of SAF pathways in the human brain. We tracked their volumetric and microstructural developmental trajectories in 243 fetuses spanning a critical period when the brain's connectome is rapidly forming. We found that SAFs emerge before sulcal folding, initially as flat, loosely arranged pathways along the subplate--white matter interface, and later reorganize into coherent U-shaped bundles. Their maturation followed a sensorimotor-to-association gradient, paralleling cortical development. Nonlinear, bundle-specific trajectories captured multiphasic maturation, with subplate dynamics preceding increases in axonal coherence and early myelination. By filling a missing link in lifespan brain connectivity, this study establishes a prenatal reference for cortical wiring and provides tools for investigating the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "content": "Humans effortlessly juggle their internal thoughts, but the neuronal dynamics that support mental manipulation are largely unknown. Leveraging the high spatiotemporal fidelity of intracranial recordings in humans (N = 30), we provide evidence that mental sound manipulation involves the inhibition of sensory cortex and the coordinated engagement of memory and control networks. This modulation manifests in two ways. First, there is a shift in the balance between faster (> 30 Hz) and slower (< 30 Hz) dynamics in primary and secondary auditory areas, suggesting a decrease in local excitability. Second, there is a distributed increase in oscillatory synchrony (6-10 Hz), which predicts imagery vividness and task performance. This evidence points to a key role of local excitability and inter-areal synchrony in the manipulation of thought.",

    "title": "Ocular speech tracking persists in blindness, but its dynamics and oculo-cerebral connectivity depend on visual status",
    "content": "While eye movements have been shown to track the speech envelope, it is unknown whether this reflects a hard-wired mechanism or one shaped by (lifetime) audiovisual experience. Further, questions remain about whether ocular tracking is modulated by speech intelligibility and which brain regions drive these synchronized eye movements. Here, we investigate ocular speech tracking in blindfolded early blind, late blind, and sighted individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source-reconstructed oculomotor signals while participants listened to narrative speech of varying intelligibility. We found that oculomotor activity tracks acoustic speech features and, unlike neural speech tracking, is not modulated by intelligibility. Interestingly, we found effects reflected in two frequency-specific components: a low-frequency (~1 Hz) effect present across all groups, indicating that visual experience is not required, and a high-frequency (~6 Hz) effect reduced in early- and late-blind individuals. Moreover, this finding is not driven by cerebro-ocular connectivity, as late-blind individuals exhibit stronger connectivity between the eyes and the left temporal cortices without a corresponding increase in ocular tracking. In conclusion, ocular speech tracking seems to respond selectively to acoustic but not to intelligibility features of speech, and it does not require visual experience to develop. It may thus represent a hard-wired oculomotor mechanism within the oculo-cerebral network involved in speech processing.",

    "content": "Inhibitory interneurons, featuring presynaptic release sites and spiking activity in dendrites, present a puzzle in their signal organization and coordination. We investigated this in local interneurons (LINs) of the primary visual thalamus using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice with both local and full-screen visual stimuli. Dendrites in single LINs showed consistent global responses to full-screen stimuli but varied responses to local stimuli. Dendrites from the same LIN exhibited different receptive fields that followed retinotopic progression. The similarity between dendritic and somatic responses decreased with increasing distance. Weak local stimuli could excite dendrites locally, while salient local stimuli triggered global responses. Salient global stimuli further enhanced motion selectivity, preference consistency, and peak responses. Thus, LINs leverage both local and global dendritic activation to perform spatially-organized, feature-selective, and size-dependent motion processing, providing new insights into the complexity and precision of sensory processing in the early visual system.",

    "content": "It is largely unknown how the brain encodes semantic distances between conceptual (verbal) knowledge. I presently show that the information on semantic distances is mainly embedded in a temporal measure (oscillation frequency) of human EEG waveforms. Participants judged a semantic relation between two words (synonym, antonym, thematically-related, taxonomically-related, or unrelated) sequentially presented. Brain rhythms (8-30 Hz) over the left language region, especially the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), were accelerated when a word pair with a high conceptual similarity (e.g. synonym) was presented. Importantly, this change in brain rhythm reflected an inter-word closeness as concepts (holistic similarity, typically seen in synonyms or thematically-related pairs), rather than an inter-word overlap of semantic features (partial similarity, typically seen in antonyms or taxonomically-related pairs). These results highlight a role of temporal measures of neural activity in semantic processing, which explains an inconsistency over previous results using hemodynamic measures.",

    "title": "A Potential Role of Postsynaptic Limitation in Activity-Dependent Homeostasis",
    "content": "The distribution of neurotransmitter release at amphibian neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is characterised by a shift from Poisson to a tight binomial distribution as calcium concentration is increased. Despite advances in our understanding of neurotransmission, a paradox remains about how the large number of active zones (AZs) that contribute to release have such a low variance, resulting in a tight binomial distribution. Muscle-specific sodium channel-blocking neurotoxins have allowed us to examine the release characteristics when the unit size of transmitter release (quantal size) is not altered. Our present study has compared the neurotransmitter release characteristics when D-tubocurarine (curare) or the Na-channel blocking conotoxin (-conotoxin GIIIB) was used as the extracellular calcium concentration was increased. Quantal neurotransmitter release from toad iliofibularis motor nerve terminals was examined using intracellular electrodes and focal extracellular electrodes. Motor nerve terminal branches for recordings were located using DiOC2(5)-fluorescent imaging. Muscle action potentials were suppressed by using -conotoxin GIIIB (-CgTx GIIIB, 2.0 x 10-6 M) or curare, 6.5 x 10-6 M. Under -CgTx GIIIB, the maximum transmitter release reached was 25 quanta at high extracellular calcium concentration (2.1 mM); conversely, under curare, quantal content reached 148 quanta (P=0.0067). Using binomial analysis, it was found that this quantal increase was due to a significant increase in the number of release sites 'n' rather than the average probability of release 'p'. Based on these observations, along with analyses of ECP shape and duration, we propose a mechanism in which a fast autoinhibitory response (< 5 ms from the nerve terminal impulse) limits the maximum level of depolarisation by voltage-dependent regulation of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel conductance.",

Music is often used to modulate arousal and mood while individuals focus on other tasks, suggesting that sophisticated musical prediction may be implicit and obligatory, operating regardless of attention. Here we investigated the role of attention in musical prediction by presenting participants simultaneously with a musical passage in one ear and an audiobook in the other. Participants were asked to attend to either speech or music to perform a recognition memory task. Musical prediction was investigated using a computational model of music which was trained on a corpus of Western music (long-term learning) and/or incrementally on each stimulus (short-term learning). While neural tracking of the acoustics of music, including encoding of note onset and pitch interval size, was enhanced by attention, musical prediction tracked the neural signal robustly regardless of attention. However, although neural tracking of long-term musical prediction based on previously-learned statistical patterns was unaffected by attention, tracking of short-term musical prediction learned from the structure of each stimulus was present only when the music was attended. Thus, attention is crucial for short-term musical learning and prediction but is not required for musical prediction based on long-term stylistic exposure.",

However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",

    "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
    "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

    "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
    "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

    "title": "Glymphatic system and mild traumatic brain injury: a mini review",
    "content": "Since the discovery of the glymphatic system in 2012, research on this brain-wide fluid exchange pathway has focused on understanding its role in different neurological diseases. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a prevalent, yet often undiagnosed, condition that increases the risk of developing debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. mTBI may lead to impaired glymphatic system function and, therefore, accumulation of metabolic waste in the brain. In this review, we summarize 24 studies (10 rodent, 13 human, 1 both) published during 2013\u20132025, reporting post-mTBI changes in the glymphatic system. According to pre-clinical models, potential post-mTBI drivers of glymphatic dysfunction include depolarization of aquaporin 4 water channels and sleep deprivation. In studies on humans, evidence is contradictory; some studies show reduced post-mTBI glymphatic activity, while others report increased activity. However, these studies used different patient populations, which were likely exposed to different mTBI types and post-injury time frames. Furthermore, studies on humans used non-invasive imaging techniques, which only indirectly measure glymphatic activity. Taken together, these inconsistencies point to major gaps in the field, highlighting the need for standardized injury classification and post-injury time frames, and more direct measurements of glymphatic activity in humans. Notably, sleep deprivation, post-concussive symptoms, and cognitive impairment have often been linked to post-injury glymphatic dysfunction. Nevertheless, to better understand mTBI implications on glymphatic system functioning, further research is needed. Such research could help develop novel diagnostics or treatment strategies for mTBI and potentially mitigate the long-term risks of developing neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Spiking neural networks for EEG signal analysis using wavelet transform",
    "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) leverage EEG signal processing to enable human-machine communication and have broad application potential. However, existing deep learning-based BCI methods face two critical limitations that hinder their practical deployment: reliance on manual EEG feature extraction, which constrains their ability to adaptively capture complex neural patterns, and high energy consumption characteristics that make them unsuitable for resource-constrained portable BCI devices requiring edge deployment.MethodsTo address these limitations, this work combines wavelet transform for automatic feature extraction with spiking neural networks for energy-efficient computation. Specifically, we present a novel spiking transformer that integrates a spiking self-attention mechanism with discrete wavelet transform, termed SpikeWavformer. SpikeWavformer enables automatic EEG signal time-frequency decomposition, eliminates manual feature extraction, and provides energy-efficient classification decision-making, thereby enhancing the model's cross-scene generalization while meeting the constraints of portable BCI applications.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SpikeWavformer in emotion recognition and auditory attention decoding tasks.DiscussionThese findings indicate that SpikeWavformer can address the key limitations of existing BCI methods and holds promise for practical deployment in portable, resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "title": "Nicotine and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: unraveling the mechanisms of nicotine addiction",
    "content": "Nicotine, recognized as the principal addictive component in tobacco, is mechanistically linked to its interaction with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels composed of five transmembrane subunits, with the \u03b14\u03b22 receptor subtype being the most common in the brain, playing a crucial role in the behavioral effects of nicotine. When nicotine binds to \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR, it significantly enhances the firing rate and burst firing of dopamine neurons in the brain, thereby activating the mesolimbic dopamine system. This system promotes the formation of nicotine addiction in the early stages of addiction through rewarding sensory stimulation and associative learning. The \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR subunit has been identified as the principal subtype implicated in the pathogenesis of nicotine addiction. However, other nAChRs subtypes also play important roles in the onset and maintenance of nicotine addiction. Understanding the relationship between nicotine addiction and nAChR subtypes is crucial for fully uncovering the neurobiological mechanism behind its addictive properties and lays the foundation for developing more targeted smoking cessation strategies.",

    "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

    "title": "Type S and M errors as a \u201crhetorical tool\u201d",
    "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

&nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

    "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

    "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

We compared the effects of self-regulation instructions to accept thoughts, emotions, or a combination of both on measures of affect (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, state anxiety) and emotional dysregulation immediately following emotion-eliciting film clips and following recovery periods after film clips. We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip. Implications of findings and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

    "content": "IntroductionAerobic exercise mitigates symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and may slow disease progression; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these improvements are not well understood. In this study, we discuss the methodology for simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), cortical activity using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and exercise performance metrics during a 40-min aerobic cycling session. Data from a single patient with PD are presented to illustrate the utility, feasibility, and data integrity of the experimental set up.MethodsThe Medtronic Percept\u2122 DBS system was used to record and stream bilateral STN-LFP in the OFF-therapy condition (OFF-DBS and OFF-antiparkinson medications) during a 40-min aerobic exercise session. A 64-channel mobile EEG system recorded cortical data. The neural data streams were synchronized using a TENS device that injected a specified electrical signal into the EEG and LFP recordings. Exercise performance metrics, heart rate, cadence, and power were synchronized with neural data and collected during the exercise session. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, trial identifying numbers NCT05905302 and NCT05972759.ResultsSTN-LFP, EEG, and exercise performance data can be synchronized, recorded for more than 40\u202fmin, and analyzed to evaluate how aerobic exercise impacts patterns of cortical and subcortical neural activity.ConclusionWhile exercise positively affects symptoms of PD, the precise effects of exercise on network activity remain unclear. The methods utilized for collecting and analyzing neural (cortical and subcortical) and exercise-related data during a typical bout of aerobic exercise suggest that this approach can be adopted for larger, long-term exercise studies in patients with PD and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The described protocol provides a roadmap for future projects aiming to combine STN-LFP and cortical data to better understand how exercise may alter cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic dynamics in PD.",

    "content": "Children from Bulgaria (N\u202f=\u202f120) were tested on language and Theory of Mind (ToM) development. Sixty were ethnic bilingual Turkish children, and 60 were monolingual ethnic Bulgarian children. The age of the children varied between 3;6 to 5;0\u202fyears old. Both groups of children in the study were tested in their mother tongues (Turkish and Bulgarian); the Turkish children were also tested in their second language (L2)\u2014Bulgarian, with a language test and Theory of Mind test. Theory of Mind was tested with classical tasks plus a non-verbal ToM task, and the language test comprised measures of wh-complements and evidentiality marking. The hypotheses tested were: H1: The comprehension and production of wh-complements in the mother tongue (L1) at ages 3\u20136\u202fyears will support the understanding of ToM in their second language (L2). H2: Understanding \u201cevidentiality\u201d marking in the mother tongue will support an understanding of false belief ToM tasks in both languages. The results show that the Turkish-speaking children had a lower level of understanding of the classical ToM tasks than the Bulgarian monolingual children, but have equivalent results on the non-verbal ToM task. In the language test, the Turkish-speaking children were better in wh-complements, but weaker in performing the evidentiality test than the Bulgarian monolinguals. The predictors of performance in classic ToM tasks were different from the two ethnic groups: for the Bulgarian monolinguals, performance on the evidentiality test was the best predictor, but for Turkish bilingual children, performance on the low verbal tasks was the only predictor other than age, for both L1 and L2 ToM.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to look into the brain functional network changes and their possible correlations with clinical traits, spontaneous arm movements, and recovery in middle cerebral artery stroke.MethodsThe study included 34 patients with acute cerebral infarction (CI) at middle artery and upper limb dyskinesia, as well as 50 healthy control (HC) participants. The spontaneous activity data of both upper limbs were recorded using a wrist activity recorder for 24\u202fh. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scales were then completed 90\u202fdays after the stroke onset. Resting-state EEG was acquired from both the CI and HC groups, and brain network features were examined using the microstate analysis. The correlations between microstates, spontaneous activity and clinical traits were investigated.ResultsCompared with the HC group, the CI group had a higher MsB duration, lower MsC coverage and occurrence, and a decrease in both MsA and MsB to MsC as well as a decrease in MsC to MsA (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); only the transition from MsC to MsB was enhanced; Reduced MsD coverage, occurrence, and duration when patients had larger FMA scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); The MsB to MsA and MsD significantly correlated with FMA. Moreover, we found increased MsC coverage and duration, as well as the transition rates of MsA and MsD to MsC in those patients with mRS scores larger than one at 90\u202fdays after stroke (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Parts of Ms parameters involving MsA significantly correlated with mRS at 90\u202fdays after stroke.ConclusionThe dynamic balance of brain networks is altered when cerebral infarction occurs, and microstates offer a portion of the functional brain network foundation that allows us to recognize these alterations. These changes in temporal dynamic parameters effectively suggest the clinical traits and functional recovery in CI.",

Working memory (WM) was assessed via a delayed-match-to-sample task (accuracy and sensitivity index d\u2019).ResultsCompared to Sham, the tACS group showed significant WM accuracy improvement (p < 0.05).

    "title": "Tracking novel visual word learning via different methods with an original FPVS-EEG approach",
    "content": "Reading is a crucial human skill and learning novel written word forms is a life-long process. Here, we tracked the emergence of novel word lexical and neural representations after a training procedure, contrasting two learning methods, in 32 monolingual adults. Half of the novel words were provided with orthographic and phonological information (OP), and half with additional explicit semantic information (OPS). At the neural level, we demonstrate for the first time the sensitivity of EEG recordings with fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) to track novel visual word learning. We used an oddball paradigm, with base stimuli (pseudowords) displayed at 10\u202fHz with deviant stimuli (words) every fifth item (at 2\u202fHz), in which word-selective responses at 2\u202fHz demonstrate lexical discrimination. While at pre-test, novel words were not discriminated, results show clear word-selective responses over the left occipital-temporal cortex (VOTC) post-learning with both methods. This finding suggests the creation of orthographic representations for novel words and fits with current views that this region is specialized for the rapid recognition and fast learning of novel word forms. Moreover, the behavioral lexical decision data reveal significant increases in reaction times after learning, for novel words\u2019 lexical neighbors, which suggests lexical engagement through competition arising from newly formed representation. Contrary to our expectations, no advantage was found for the OPS method. Instead, results show stronger behavioral and neural changes with the OP method. In the discussion, we highlight possible reasons for this unexpected finding. First, the current implementation of the OPS method displaying simultaneous images and words during learning could have dragged the participant\u2019s attention away from the orthographic form. Second, the speed of presentation of stimuli might have been too fast to allow fast semantic retrieval. Finally, semantic learning might have a different timeframe than word form learning, and the current findings would reflect only the latter. Our results nevertheless highlight the rapid emergence of new word-form representations, captured by the EEG-FPVS approach.",

    "title": "Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia mediate the negative impact of HbA1c levels on mild cognitive impairment",
    "content": "BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) in basal ganglia (BG) on the relationship between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).MethodsData on HbA1c levels and MOCA scores and CSVD imaging markers, including EPVS volume and distribution patterns were collected. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for MCI. A mediation effect analysis was further conducted to determine whether BG-EPVS mediate the impact of HbA1c on cognitive impairment.ResultsA total of 244 CSVD patients were enrolled in this study. Compared with non-DM patients, DM patients had a significantly greater BG-EPVS volume (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and more severe periventricular white matter hyperintensities (p-WMH) (p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension [odds ratio (OR)\u202f=\u202f3.823; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.707\u20138.566; p\u202f=\u202f0.001], the HbA1c level (OR\u202f=\u202f1.689; 95%CI:1.255\u20132.272; p<0.001) and BG-EPVS volume (OR\u202f=\u202f1.001; 95% CI:1.000\u20131.003; p\u202f=\u202f0.038) were independent risk factors for MCI. After adjusting for sex and age, partial correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between BG-EPVS volume and HbA1c (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.137; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) and a significant negative correlation with MOCA scores (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.160; p\u202f=\u202f0.013). The effect of HbA1c on MCI in patients with CSVD was indirectly mediated by BG-EPVS volume (indirect effect\u202f=\u202f\u22120.074; 95% CI: \u22120.187 to \u22120.012; the mediating effect ratio was 11.3%).ConclusionHbA1c is an independent risk factor for MCI. Increased BG-EPVS volume mediates the partial effect of HbA1c on CSVD-related cognitive dysfunction.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",

    "title": "EEG workload estimation and classification: a systematic review",
    "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into an indispensable instrument for estimating cognitive workload in various domains. Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly employed to develop accurate workload estimation and classification models based on EEG data. The goal of this systematic review is to compile the body of research on EEG workload estimation and classification using ML and DL approaches. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were followed in conducting the review, searches were conducted through databases at SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Science Direct from the beginning to the end of 16 February 2024. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to capture study design, participant demographics, EEG features, ML/DL algorithms, and reported performance metrics. Results. Out of the 125 items that emerged, 33 scientific papers were fully evaluated. The study designs, participant demographics, and EEG workload measurement and categorization techniques used in the investigations differed. Support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid networks are examples of ML and DL approaches that were often used. Analyzing the accuracy scores achieved by different ML/DL models. Furthermore, a relationship was noted between sample frequency and model accuracy, with higher sample frequencies generally leading to improved performance. The percentage distribution of ML/DL methods revealed that SVMs, CNNs, and recurrent neural networks were the most commonly utilized techniques, reflecting their robustness in handling EEG data. Significance. The comprehensive review emphasizes how ML may be used to identify mental workload across a variety of disciplines using EEG data. Optimizing practical applications requires multimodal data integration, standardization efforts, and real-world validation studies. These systems will also be further improved by addressing ethical issues and investigating new EEG properties, which will improve human\u2013computer interaction and performance assessment.",

    "title": "DYRK1A in the physiology and pathology of the neuron-astrocyte axis",
    "content": "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a dosage-sensitive kinase with critical roles in the neuron-astrocyte axis. During brain development, DYRK1A ensures the proper number of differentiated neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, this DYRK1A regulates neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. However, its functions in astrocytes are not yet well defined, with limited evidence indicating roles in astrocyte reactivity and excitotoxicity. Due to trisomy 21, DYRK1A is overexpressed in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). This imbalance directly contributes to neuronal death and likely astrocyte pathology, accelerating the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in this population. Notably, DYRK1A overexpression also correlates with neurodegeneration and AD progression in elderly euploid adults. This correlation positions DYRK1A as a potential bridge between DS and AD, mechanistically connecting gene overdosage and neuropathology in both conditions. However, research on DYRK1A pathophysiology has primarily centered on neurons, leaving astrocytes largely understudied. Considering the vital neuroprotective functions of astrocytes, broadening DYRK1A research to encompass these cells presents an opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms contributing to the neurodegenerative process in AD. In this review, we highlight the physiology and pathology of DYRK1A in the neuron\u2013astrocyte axis, analyzing its roles in neurons and positing hypothetical functions in astrocytes, with particular emphasis on the contribution of DYRK1A\u2019s cell-specific overexpression to neurodegeneration and AD progression.",

    "title": "Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data",
    "content": "Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available electroencephalography data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.",

    "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
    "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I'm excited to share <strong>NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer</strong>, a comprehensive, open-source tool written primarily in <strong>Python</strong> designed to enhance system and network performance for gamers.</p> <p>While the primary use case is gaming, the core is a set of Python modules for process management, network analysis, and system configuration, making it a great example of Python for low-level system interaction on Windows/Linux.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer is a utility suite that addresses common performance bottlenecks by providing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Network Optimization:</strong> Uses a Python module to analyze and test latency to various global servers (especially for games like League of Legends) and includes a traffic shaper to prioritize gaming packets (QoS).</li> <li><strong>System Performance:</strong> Manages system resources by setting high process priority for games, cleaning up unnecessary background applications, and optimizing RAM usage in real-time.</li> <li><strong>System-Agnostic Core:</strong> The majority of the logic is contained in cross-platform Python scripts (<code>main.py</code>, <code>modules/</code>), with platform-specific commands handled by batch/shell scripts (<code>run.bat</code>, <code>run.sh</code>).</li> </ul> <p>Target Audience</p> <p>This tool is primarily for <strong>PC Gamers</strong> who are performance-conscious and want a free, transparent alternative to commercial &quot;game booster&quot; software.</p> <p>From a development perspective, the <strong>Target Audience</strong> also includes <strong>Python developers</strong> interested in:</p> <ul> <li>Python for <strong>system programming</strong> (e.g., process and memory management on Windows/Linux).</li> <li>Building <strong>cross-platform utility applications</strong> with a Python backend.</li> </ul> <p>This is meant to be a <strong>production-ready utility</strong> that is robust and reliable for daily use.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer differentiates itself from existing optimization software in two key areas:</p> <p>|| || |<strong>Feature</strong>|<strong>NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer</strong>|<strong>Commercial Alternatives (e.g., Razer Cortex)</strong>| |<strong>Source Code</strong>|<strong>100% Open Source (MIT Licensed)</strong>|Closed Source| |<strong>Data/Telemetry</strong>|<strong>Privacy-First (No Telemetry, All Local)</strong>|Often collect usage data| |<strong>Customization</strong>|Python-based modules are easily auditable and modifiable.|Configuration limited to the provided UI.| |<strong>Core Function</strong>|Focuses on Network Quality, FPS, and RAM.|Varies, often focuses heavily on simple process termination.|</p> <p>You can find the full source code and installation steps on GitHub:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/toozuuu/ngxsmk-gamenet-optimizer\"><strong>GitHub Repository: toozuuu/ngxsmk-gamenet-optimizer</strong></a></p> <p>Feel free to check out the code and provide any feedback, particularly on the Python modules for system-level operations!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forsaken_Lie_9989\"> /u/Forsaken_Lie_9989 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oc4122/ngxsmk_gamenet_optimizer_a_pythonpowered/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oc4122/ngxsmk_gamenet_optimizer_a_pythonpowered/\">[comments]</a></span>",
