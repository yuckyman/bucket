    "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
    "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

    "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

    "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

    "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS.

    "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
    "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

    "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
    "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

    "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "How to deal with regression to the mean when selecting out conscious trials in order to analyze unconscious trials.",
    "content": "In implicit cognition research generally, one standard strategy is to measure the conscious status of knowledge on each trial (e.g., with confidence, structural knowledge attributions, visual clarity ratings) and then subselect the trials where the knowledge is measured to be unconscious. If the accuracy is above chance on the latter trials that is taken to be evidence for unconscious knowledge. Shanks (2017) has pointed out the problem of regression to the mean when trials (or people) are subselected based on a variable: Because of the ubiquitous possibility of error in measurement, the estimated value of the variable for the subset selected based on preselection scores will be biased. Thus, for example, trials selected to be based on unconscious knowledge will actually sometimes be based on conscious knowledge to an extent that can be estimated by the proportion of conscious trials in the study as a whole. Does this critique undermine the separate analyses of categories obtained on every trial, such as structural knowledge attributions in implicit learning research, or confidence or Perceptual Awareness Scale ratings in subliminal perception research? I show how to quantify the maximum effect that could be produced by regression to the mean in a given situation, how it may be a problem but it may also be so small as to be meaningless, and how to deal with it when it is of a moderate size, using Bayes factors with an interval null hypothesis. The method deals with regression to the mean, but not all problems of bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN! We are Klavis AI (<a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai/\">https://www.klavis.ai/</a>) and we're launching Strata, one open-source MCP server that helps AI agents use thousands of API tools without getting overwhelmed. Instead of showing all available tools at once, Strata reveals them step-by-step based on what the AI actually needs.<p>As a former Senior SWE on Google Gemini 's tool use team, I saw firsthand how AI would struggle with tools. If you've built AI agents, you've likely hit the same walls: (1) AI agents struggle to pick the right API from hundreds of options. (2) Tool descriptions and info consume massive token budgets. (3) Most servers cap at 40~50 tools to avoid these problems, limiting what you can build.<p>Instead of flooding the AI with everything upfront, Strata works like a human would. It guides the AI agents to discover relevant categories, then lists available actions in those categories. It relies on LLMs\u2019 reasoning to drill down progressively to find the exact tool needed. Here are some examples:<p><i>Github query: \"Find my stale pull requests in our main repo\"</i><p>Strata: AI model identifies GitHub \u2192 Shows categories (Repos, Issues, PRs, Actions) \u2192 AI selects PRs \u2192 Shows PR-specific actions -> AI selects list_pull_requests \u2192 Shows  list_pull_requests details -> Executes list_pull_requests with the right parameters.<p><i>Jira query: \"Create a bug ticket in the 'MOBILE' project about the app crashing on startup.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Jira \u2192 Shows categories (Projects, Issues, Sprints) \u2192 AI selects Issues \u2192 Shows actions (create_issue, get_issue) \u2192 AI selects create_issue \u2192 Shows create_issue details \u2192 Executes with correct parameters.<p><i>Slack query: \"Post a message in the #announcements channel that bonus will be paid out next Friday.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Slack \u2192 Shows categories (Channels, Messages, Users) \u2192 AI selects Messages \u2192 Shows actions (send_message, schedule_message) \u2192 AI selects send_message \u2192 Shows send_message details \u2192 Executes with correct parameters.<p>This progressive approach unlocks a huge advantage: depth. While most integrations offer a handful of high-level tools, Strata can expose hundreds of granular features for a single app like GitHub, Jira, etc. Your AI agent can finally access the deep, specific features that real workflows require, without getting lost in a sea of options.<p>Under the hood, Strata manages authentication tokens and includes a built-in search tool for the agent to dig into documentation if it gets stuck.<p>On the MCPMark <a href=\"https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp</a>, Strata achieves +15.2% higher pass@1 rate vs the official GitHub server and +13.4% higher pass@1 rate vs the official Notion server. In human eval tests, it hits 83%+ accuracy on complex, real-world multi-app workflows.<p>Here is a quick demo to watch Strata navigate a complex workflow with multiple apps, automatically selecting the right tools at each step: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM</a>.<p>You can connect to any external MCP Server into Strata, and we have an open source version for it: <a href=\"https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis</a>.<p>For team or production use with more features, visit our website: <a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai\">https://www.klavis.ai</a>. Add Strata to Cursor, VS Code or any MCP-compatible application with one click. You can also use our API to easily plug in Strata to your AI application.<p>We look forward to your comments.

    "content": "Learning depends not only on the content of what we learn, but also on how we learn and on how experiences are structured over time. To investigate how task similarity and training regime interact during learning, we trained participants on spatial and conceptual learning tasks that shared either similar or distinct underlying structures, using either interleaved or blocked regimes. Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity. We also replicated our results using a neural network model, providing converging evidence for the computational principles governing the interplay between training regime and structural similarity in multi-task learning.",

    "title": "Familial Risk for Dementia, Cognitive Performance, and the Human Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit: A Study in the European Prevention of Alzheimers Disease cohort",
    "content": "The cerebellohippocampal (CBHP) circuit is increasingly implicated in episodic and spatial memory, yet its role in normal aging, dementia risk, and sex differences remains unclear. Structure and function in both the hippocampus and cerebellum have been linked to mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers Disease, and cognitive decline in healthy older adults. Literature on the CBHP circuit is largely limited to animal studies and small samples of young adults in the context of visuospatial abilities, underscoring the need for large, diverse aging cohorts to establish CB-HP connectivity as an early, translatable marker of neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate the CBHP circuit in the context of aging, dementia risk, behavior, and sex differences in healthy older adults to advance understanding of cognitive decline in the aging population. We explored this relationship in 857 healthy adults with and without a family history of dementia (aged 50-88, 59% female, 71% family history positive) using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsMRI) and behavioral assessments. We hypothesized that CB-HP functional connectivity (FC) would be lower with increased age, relate positively to cognitive performance, be lower in females positive for family history of dementia, and be lower in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-risk than cognitively normal (CN) participants with sex differences therein. We observed selective links between CBHP FC, cognition, and sex. MCI risk participants performed worse on spatial memory performances than CN, whereas CBHP FC showed opposite performance slopes by risk status, suggesting the CBHP circuit may function as a compensatory network for short-term recall. Sex differences were seen on cognitive tasks (delayed episodic memory and spatial tasks) and in CBHP a better visuospatial index was linked to greater FC in females, while males displayed an inverse relationship. Behavioral differences by familial dementia history were shown, although CBHP FC did not show effects here. Overall, CB-HP networks appear behaviorally silent in the aggregate but reveal risk and sex dependent relationships when memory demands and circuit nodes are considered.",

    "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

    "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
    "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

    "title": "Case Report: When multiple system atrophy masquerades as CASPR2 autoimmune encephalopathy: a diagnostic pitfall",
    "content": "IntroductionMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid progression. Early diagnosis remains particularly challenging, especially when CASPR2 antibodies are detected during the early stages of disease progression.Case presentationA 56-year-old female presented with chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. Serum analysis revealed the presence of CASPR2 antibodies. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum. The external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) indicated autonomic nerve dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, no clinical improvement was observed. During follow-up, symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction emerged, leading to a clinical established diagnosis of cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C).ConclusionIn the early stages of MSA, autonomic nerve dysfunction may not manifest clinically. Therefore, close follow-up is essential for accurate diagnosis. EAS-EMG exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subclinical autonomic dysfunction. Although the co-occurrence of MSA-C and high-titer (1:100) CASPR2-IgG is uncommon, this case highlights the critical importance of relying on the overall clinical presentation, rather than on isolated laboratory findings, to establish the primary diagnosis.",

    "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
    "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

    "content": "A series of three studies in the United States, collectively involving 2,216 research participants and including two nationwide Internet surveys, examined the relationship of anomalous experiences with the psychological trait of subconscious connectedness, as well as with several other psychological characteristics hypothesized to contribute to such experiences. Anomalous experiences were assessed with the 13-question Unusual Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) created for this research program. Exploratory factor analysis showed the UEQ to be composed of a single anomalous experiences factor. The questionnaire had high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89\u2013.92) and split-half reliability (Guttman\u2019s \u03bb-2 = .89\u2013.91). In all three studies, individuals with high subconscious connectedness (measured with the Thought Impact Scale) reported a substantial excess of anomalous experiences compared to those with low subconscious connectedness and were more likely to report having repeated instances of each type of anomalous experiences assessed, such as highly improbable synchronicity events, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, premonition, sensing thoughts from others, influencing people with thoughts, or out-of-body experiences. Other psychological variables that correlated significantly with people\u2019s amount of anomalous experiences included dissociation, absorption, faith in intuition, magical ideation, fantasy proneness, openness to experience, and paranormal beliefs. Most people (84%\u201386%) in the two national surveys reported having repeatedly had one or more of the 13 types of anomalous experiences assessed by the UEQ. A greater amount of these experiences was correlated with higher life stress and more anxiety and depression symptoms. The findings of this series of studies indicate that high subconscious connectedness is associated with higher frequency and greater variety of anomalous experiences.

    "content": "The Rorschach cards may elicit components of personality functioning that escape consciousness but which may influence observable performance during the test. Similarly, the manifest content of dreams may contain unconscious experiential elements that contribute to the formation of the content that the subject then remembers and tells to other people. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correspondence between the content of a person\u2019s dreams and the attributions made by the same person when viewing the Rorschach inkblot designs. Participants aged 18\u201364 years were selected based on criteria related to the frequency of dream recall (i.e., at least once per week). The final sample of our study consisted of 41 individuals (24 women) aged 20\u201357 years (<em>M</em> = 27.10; <em>SD</em> = 8.09). The dream narratives were collected via email and coded according to the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. There was an association between the content of the dreams and the Rorschach responses in relation to the presence of immature visual imagery, the tendency to see things in perspective, possible occurrence of dissociative experiences, physical worries, and ideas of harm, feelings of fear, a sense of danger and pain, and sadism, that is, disturbing contents possibly related to the loosening of censorship mechanisms during the dream state. This is the first study to examine the possible relationship between dream content and Rorschach responses using an empirical approach capable of understanding the unconscious and subconscious components underlying psychological functioning.

    "title": "Ignorance is bliss: A meta-analysis of the fear-reducing effects of very brief exposure.",
    "content": "Neuroscientific research on the unconscious basis of fear has been translated into novel interventions designed to reduce fear without conscious awareness. To date, the most empirically supported nonconscious exposure intervention is <em>very brief exposure</em> (VBE), the continuous presentation of masked phobic images. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of VBE to compare the effects on phobic participants who were subjectively unaware versus aware of the masked stimuli to test the hypotheses that the lack of awareness of exposure facilitates the fear-reducing effects of VBE, whereas awareness of exposure prevents these effects. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-based search yielded 13 RCTs of VBE representing 576 phobic participants, identified by a validated questionnaire and a Behavioral Avoidance Test in which they approached a live tarantula. VBE to masked spiders reduced avoidance and experienced fear of the tarantula significantly more than masked placebo exposure in phobic participants who were unaware of these stimuli, with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> = .75 for avoidance; <em>d</em> = .75 for experienced fear). In phobic participants who were aware of the masked stimuli, Bayesian analyses showed that VBE did not reduce these fear-related behaviors any more than placebo exposure. VBE reduced avoidance of a live tarantula significantly more in phobic participants who were unaware of the masked spiders than in those who were aware of them (Hedges\u2019 <em>g</em> = .38). These meta-analytic findings are the most comprehensive evidence, to date, attesting to the fear-reducing efficacy of an intervention that bypasses phobic participants\u2019 subjective awareness of exposure to feared stimuli.

Resilience has been associated with protective variables, whereas hypnotizability has been related to psychopathological variables. This systematic review aims to identify the studies that associate hypnotizability with resilience and self-control. This review included studies with adults in which hypnotizability and resilience/self-control were associated with each other. Articles were identified by searching in PubMed, PubPsych, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded 315 studies published until October 2022. None of them met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, hypnosis is used to generate changes in resilience. Findings show that hypnosis has beneficial effects on coping and symptoms associated with sickness and improves patients\u2019 quality of life. However, studies exploring the possible association between resilience and hypnotizability have yet to be found. There continues to be a research bias by which hypnotizability is associated with psychopathological aspects. Given the positive effects of hypnosis and resilience on mental health, it is relevant to design studies investigating the relationship between hypnotizability and resilience.

We also included a no instructions condition to replicate previous findings supporting the salutary effect of acceptance. We tested 100 undergraduates and evaluated a subsample of 50 participants with high trait anxiety (TA). Analyses revealed no significant differences in variables among conditions in the overall sample. However, in the high TA subsample, accepting a combination of both thoughts and emotions was related to greater positive affect compared with no instructions following the neutral film clip and following the recovery period after the fear-inducing film clip.

The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

    "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

    "content": "Objective: There is a need for effective cognitive assessment tools to evaluate the development of very young children in resource-limited low- and middle-income country settings. Our objective was to evaluate the field usability of a computer-based attention test and its concurrent validity with a caregiver-reported screener of neurodevelopment in rural, Ecuadorian children. Method: To assess a computer-based attention test in a resource-limited setting, 41 Ecuadorian children between 2 and 4 years of age were evaluated once with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention adapted to eye-tracking instrumentation. To evaluate the validity of the ECVT, results were compared with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133, measured 3\u20134 times between 21 and 48 months of age. Results: ECVT measures were collected successfully for 97.6% of children (40/41), suggesting good field usability of the test in this resource-limited setting. An increase in 1 SD in child attention, as measured by the ECVT average fixation duration, was associated with a 7.9-point increase in the overall Ages and Stages Questionnaire\u20133 score (95% CI [1.5, 14.2], <em>p</em> = .015). Conclusions: A computer-based attention assessment in early childhood was usable in a resource-limited setting and predictive of a caregiver-reported screener of child neurodevelopment. The ECVT, therefore, can be used to assess the effects of early risk factors and resilience in brain/behavior development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index \u201cspeed\u201d potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. Method: The present study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children aged 8\u201312 with and without ADHD (<em>N</em> = 119). Results: There was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the <em>tau</em> parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD and among children with low working memory capacity (regardless of ADHD status). Variance in <em>tau</em> was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of adopting analytic methods that can more accurately describe performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Here, we determine whether familiarizing individuals with self-appraisal with daily memory testing for 7 days provide a more accurate estimate of cognitive functioning and mood. Method: Two hundred twenty-five participants (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> \u00b1 <em>SD</em>: 74.1 \u00b1 8.3 years; 66% female; median education 16.0 years) completed the online Boston Remote Assessment for NeuroCognitive Health, which included two associative memory tasks, for seven consecutive days. Each day, participants self-appraised their performance. At baseline, they completed various cognitive and mood measures. We computed Pearson\u2019s correlations between task performance and self-appraisal on Days 1 and 7 and used linear models to examine the relationship between self-appraisal scores and clinical measures. Results: Accuracy (Day 1: 0.44 \u00b1 0.12; Day 7: 0.81 \u00b1 0.16) and self-appraisal (Day 1: 0.36 \u00b1 0.15; Day 7: 0.70 \u00b1 0.21) increased, as did the association between accuracy and self-appraisal, Day 1: correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [0.09, 0.34], <em>p</em> = .001; Day 7: <em>r</em> = 0.69, 95% CI [0.62, 0.76], <em>p</em> < .001. Self-appraisal scores on Day 7, but not Day 1, showed significant relationships with in-clinic measures. Conclusions: Repeated remote cognitive assessments may help elucidate individuals\u2019 capacities to refine their self-perception of cognitive performance during multiday learning. The weak association between accuracy and test-na\u00efve self-appraisal warrants caution about using this metric cross-sectionally. Experienced self-appraisal could be especially relevant at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when subtle learning difficulties emerge and could improve our capacity to detect early meta-cognitive changes.

    "content": "Objective: Neuropsychological norms serve to identify cognitive impairment and monitor neurodegenerative disease progression. However, longitudinal data are limited, and conventional approaches do not account for biomarkers to exclude underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, reducing sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD. To address these limitations, this research provides robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms derived from Spanish individuals with nonpathological levels of AD biomarkers. Method: We analyzed 3-year follow-up data from 350 cognitively unimpaired individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s and Families+ cohort). A subset of 228 individuals with normal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242/40, phosphorylated-tau181, and total-tau biomarkers defined the robust reference group. Neuropsychological assessment encompassed the Trail Making Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Memory Binding Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013IV, Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013IV, Semantic Fluency Test, and Judgment of Line Orientation from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Using the Reliable Change Index and Standardized Regression-Based methods, robust longitudinal neuropsychological norms were derived from the reference group. Validation analysis assessed the sensitivity of robust versus conventional normative procedures. Results: Models, equations, percentiles, and cutoffs for identifying significant cognitive decline were provided. Robust norms showed modestly greater sensitivity in certain measures, particularly in episodic memory. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: Total Free Delayed Recall showed the most notable result at the 5th percentile in Reliable Change Index (\u03c7\u00b2 = 16.06, <em>p</em> = 6.15E-05).

    "content": "Objective: Many veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) report disruptions in cognition; however, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these cognitive difficulties are not well understood. It is also unknown whether PTSD symptomatology or past mTBIs uniquely impact functions important to adaptation such as cognitive control. Method: We examined event-related potentials elicited by a flanker task to evaluate brain responses during conflict monitoring in a sample of 192 U.S. military veterans with combat-zone experience and exposure to explosive blasts. Clinical assessments characterized diagnoses as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms and mTBI so that we could parse overlapping syndromes and directly contrast effects of the two conditions. Results: Across groups, participants performed worse on conflict trials (Incongruent distractors), particularly when preceded by a no-conflict (Congruent distractors) trial. We found that greater dysphoric PTSD symptomatology was related to a reduced early perceptual response (P1), while greater avoidance PTSD symptomatology predicted a larger early visual attention response (N1). Although late cognitive processes (N2, P3) were sensitive to cognitive control demands of the flanker task, posttraumatic symptomatology and mTBI severity were unrelated to them. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the Avoidance and Dysphoria domains of PTSD symptomatology may differentially relate to early neural functions of perception and visual attention rather than later cognitive responses. Rehabilitation and treatment of individuals with PTSD and mTBI may be most productive when focused on perceptual and attentional processing, which could improve cognitive control.

I probably would not have built it if I had to go and pick up some JS + HTML just to create the front end!</p> <p>### Comparison</p> <p>Hmm not sure if I've seen any apps like it but im sure there's plenty, I just havent searched for them.</p> <p>Source Video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eXaa40MiIGs\">https://youtu.be/eXaa40MiIGs</a></p> <p>Framework Used to build: <a href=\"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex\">https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wonderful-Today-497\"> /u/Wonderful-Today-497 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnqa6s/an_app_i_built_with_reflex/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnqa6s/an_app_i_built_with_reflex/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

    "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
    "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

    "title": "The modulatory effect of evaluative valence on fear generalization in social anxiety: an SSVEP study",
    "content": "BackgroundSocial anxiety is characterized by excessive sensitivity and concern about social evaluation. While previous research has demonstrated attentional bias and fear generalization in socially anxious individuals, the neural mechanisms by which different evaluative valences modulate this process remain unclear.MethodThis study employed a fear generalization paradigm combined with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Fifty-one college students were recruited and divided into high (n = 25) and low (n = 26) social anxiety groups. A face-evaluation paradigm was used to record both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses during fear generalization.ResultsAt the behavioral level, the high social anxiety group showed a broader fear generalization gradient. Both groups demonstrated higher unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings under negative versus positive evaluation conditions. This effect manifested differently between groups: in the high social anxiety group, it was specific to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) and generalization stimulus 4 (GS4), whereas in the low social anxiety group, it was observed for generalization stimulus 1 (GS1). At the neural level, SSVEP results revealed enhanced visual cortical activation (Oz, PO8) in the high social anxiety group across all stimuli. The PO7 electrode specifically reflected a differential modulation by evaluative valence between the groups; this adaptive modulation was evident in the low social anxiety group but absent in the high social anxiety group.ConclusionThis study reveals that social anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of early visual hypervigilance. Critically, we provide neurophysiological evidence that a core deficit underlying this condition is an impaired ability to utilize positive evaluation to down-regulate this hypervigilance. These results redefine our understanding of the cognitive-neural mechanisms of social anxiety, shifting the focus toward deficits in the neural processing of positive social information, and suggest that interventions should aim to restore the adaptive processing of positive social feedback.",

    "content": "IntroductionBehavioral performance during associative learning typically improves monotonically; performance on each successive iteration of the task is no worse (and typically better) than on the previous one. It is unclear whether connectomic measures of brain function (from fMRI data acquired during learning) also increase monotonically. We used a well-established associative learning paradigm to test for the possible co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and connectomics.MethodsfMRI data were summarized using two distinct connectomic (i.e., graph theoretic) measures: (a) Betweenness Centrality (of nodes) and (b) Average Shortest Path Length (i.e., a measure of network efficiency) across the graph. To broaden our study\u2019s breath, in addition to healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f39), we extended the analyses to data collected in schizophrenia patients (n\u202f=\u202f49). Past studies show that although patients show deficits in learning (lower learning capacity), behavior does typically display monotonicity.ResultsWe observed robust evidence for monotonic changes in behavior at the group level, and in most participants regardless of group. Evidence for monotonic changes in graph theoretic summaries of the co-acquired fMRI data was less widespread and was in general, more evident in group level summaries (regardless of group).DiscussionThis modest co-observance of monotonicity in behavior and fMRI-based connectomics re-emphasizes what has long been suspected: the relationship between overt measures of behavioral competence and the co-acquired imaging signals is complex. This may be because psychological events (whether in the healthy brain, or in clinical populations like schizophrenia) emerge not from local activity in circumscribed brain regions, but rather from widely distributed activity across the brain. While well-defined mathematical concepts like monotonicity can anchor attempts to co-observe properties of change in overt behavior, and underlying brain signals, we suggest that the search for such relationships will remain a challenge.",

    "title": "In vitro clustered cortical networks reveal NMDA-dependent modulation of repetitive activation sequences",
    "content": "The development of in vitro networks composed of distinct but interacting neuronal sub-populations (clusters) has advanced the study of emergent behaviors in neural networks as individual functional units. In a previous work, we developed an in vitro model of a network formed by four mutually interconnected clusters of rat embryonic cortical neurons cultured on multi-electrode arrays (MEA), where we observed recurring, spatially and temporally structured activation sequences. In the present study, we examined the effects of NMDAR blockade (MK-801) to modulate such temporal patterns. We found that MK-801 reduced the overall excitability of the network and disrupted the diversity of repeated activation patterns, while paradoxically increasing their temporal persistence. This led the network to transition from a dynamic regime characterized by frequent and flexible repetitions to one dominated by fewer, more stable and enduring activation motifs. Functional connectivity analysis further revealed a selective weakening of inter-cluster links alongside a strengthening of intra-cluster connections. This reorganization likely explains the observed reduction in activity propagation between clusters and the simultaneous emergence of more persistent activation sequences among clusters. Data suggest that clustered neural networks serve as semi-autonomous modules, capable of sustaining internal dynamics even under diminished excitatory drive. The stable repetition of activation patterns may reflect a functional \u201cclosure\u201d within clusters, forming self-sustained loops that enable the reactivation of previously formed motifs. From a neuroengineering perspective, this model provides a versatile platform to explore how spatiotemporal neural dynamics underpin inter-network communication, information encoding, and complex cortical functions.",

    "title": "TFANet: a temporal fusion attention neural network for motor imagery decoding",
    "content": "IntroductionIn the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), motor imagery (MI) classification is a critically important task, with the primary objective of decoding an individual's MI intentions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, MI decoding faces significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent complex temporal dependencies of EEG signals.MethodsThis paper proposes a temporal fusion attention network (TFANet), which aims to improve the decoding performance of MI tasks by accurately modeling the temporal dependencies in EEG signals. TFANet introduces a multi-scale temporal self-attention (MSTSA) mechanism that captures temporal variation in EEG signals across different time scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global features. Moreover, the model adaptively adjusts the channel weights through a channel attention module, allowing it to focus on key signals related to motor imagery. This further enhances the utilization of temporal features. Moreover, by integrating the temporal depthwise separable convolution fusion network (TDSCFN) module, TFANet reduces computational burden while enhancing the ability to capture temporal patterns.ResultsThe proposed method achieves a within-subject classification accuracy of 84.92% and 88.41% on the BCIC-IV-2a and BCIC-IV-2b datasets, respectively. Furthermore, using a transfer learning approach on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, a cross-subject classification accuracy of 77.2% is attained.ConclusionThese results demonstrate that TFANet is an effective approach for decoding MI tasks with complex temporal dependencies.",

The action effect refers to the acceleration of target search when targets share features with previously acted-upon stimuli.MethodsIn this study, to further understand its cognitive mechanism, we investigated whether the action effect is modulated by cognitive load. Participants were instructed to press a key if the prime stimulus (a colored color word) matched a specified color. Otherwise, they were instructed to passively view the prime. The color of the prime was either congruent (no cognitive load) or incongruent (cognitive load) with its semantic meaning. The magnitude of the action effect between the two conditions was compared. Using EEG technology, we addressed the research gap concerning the neural mechanisms underlying the action effect.ResultsBehaviorally, response times were shorter in the action condition compared to the no-action condition, confirming the presence of the action effect. Notably, the magnitude of the action effect was equivalent between the congruence and incongruence conditions. Electrophysiological data revealed that attentional priority for acted-on stimuli was enhanced, while the response selection process was delayed. Importantly, all neural markers\u2014including N2pc, P300b, and late LPC\u2014exhibited minimal differences between the congruent and incongruent conditions.DiscussionThe findings provide robust evidence that the action effect remains intact in the presence of cognitive load.

    "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis and systemic metabolic disturbances contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of bavachalcone, a prenylated chalcone isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, with a particular focus on its effects on motor function, inflammation, gut microbiota, and serum metabolism.MethodsMale C57BL/6 mice were divided into Control, MPTP, Bavac-L (low-dose bavachalcone), and Bavac-H (high-dose bavachalcone) groups. Bavachalcone was administered by gavage, followed by MPTP injection to induce PD. Behavioral assessments (open field test, pole test, and rotarod test), western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, 16S rDNA sequencing of fecal microbiota, and untargeted metabolomics of serum were performed to evaluate the effects of bavachalcone.ResultsBavachalcone significantly alleviated MPTP-induced motor impairment, preserved dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum, and reduced systemic inflammation and glial activation. Gut microbiota analysis showed that bavachalcone improved microbial richness and diversity, enriched beneficial genera, such as Allobaculum, and suppressed harmful taxa, such as Ligilactobacillus and Helicobacter. Metabolomic profiling revealed that bavachalcone modulated pathways, including pyruvate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism.ConclusionBavachalcone exerts neuroprotective effects in mice with PD by improving motor function, preserving dopaminergic neurons, reducing inflammation, modulating gut microbiota composition, and remodeling systemic metabolism. These findings highlight bavachalcone as a promising therapeutic candidate for PD.",

Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

    "title": "Acquired crowding dyslexia: A peripheral reading deficit other than neglect dyslexia.",
    "content": "Objectives: Crowding refers to the phenomenon whereby small visual objects above the acuity threshold are detected but unrecognizable when surrounded by nearby stimuli. It affects reading in healthy individuals and can be enhanced in reading impairments. By increasing the interletter space, crowding decreases. Previous evidence on patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and peripheral dyslexia has shown a dissociation in sensitivity to spacing manipulation between those who mainly produced omissions and those characterized by substitutions in reading. Here, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that the reading impairment mainly characterized by substitutions is dissociated from USN, unlike the one characterized by omissions. Method: In a retrospective study, we collected 38 right-brain-damaged patients, 21 with USN. We analyzed the number and types of errors in reading single words and pseudowords, spaced and unspaced, comparing patients with and without USN. Results: USN patients showed significantly more omissions than patients without USN and increased omissions with letter spacing. Substitutions were more frequent in USN patients but did not increase with spacing. Performance of patients mainly characterized by substitutions revealed a reduction of errors with spaced pseudowords and a double dissociation from USN. Lesion overlap analysis suggested that the two deficits could depend on different components of visuospatial attention networks. Conclusions: We claim that proper neglect dyslexia is characterized by omission errors and has USN as a necessary mechanism, even if not sufficient. Conversely, acquired crowding dyslexia is a different reading deficit, characterized by substitutions due to an enhanced crowding phenomenon, independent of USN.

    "title": "Joint effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cannabis on neurocognition.",
    "content": "Objective: Cannabis has become increasingly accessible to populations living with chronic health conditions such as HIV. Many people living with HIV are turning to cannabis for symptom relief despite the unclear risks to neurocognitive health. Our study sought to replicate and extend prior research by examining global and domain-specific neurocognitive performance between four groups stratified by use of cannabis (CB; CB+/CB\u2212) and HIV serostatus (HIV+/HIV\u2212). Method: Our demographically diverse community sample (<em>N</em> = 269) underwent exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the effects of cannabis use (CU) and HIV on neurocognition. We explored between-group comparisons of neurocognitive performance, probability of neurocognitive impairment, and interactive effects of CU/HIV serostatus. Results: Between-group comparisons revealed nonsignificant differences in global or domain-specific neurocognitive performance. However, the CB+/HIV+ group was three times (99% CI [1.18, 9.57]) more likely to be labeled with a memory impairment compared to the control (CB-/HIV\u2212), and the CB+/HIV\u2212 group was twice (99% CI [.14, 7.47]) as likely to be labeled with an executive functioning impairment compared to the control. We also identified an interactive effect between the past 30-day CU and HIV serostatus for global (<em>b</em> = \u2212.026, 99% CI [\u2212.04, \u2212.01]) and motor (<em>b</em> = \u2212.052, 99% CI [\u2212.07, \u2212.03]) neurocognitive performance. Findings support a nuanced relationship between CU and HIV, which may partly explain mixed literature. Conclusions: Although we conclude that recent and heavy CU poses risk of neurocognitive decline among people living with HIVs, this effect is modest. Physicians and patients must weigh a possible decrease in global and motor neurocognition against the severity of symptoms being treated.

Quests now auto generate quest to quest, evolving over time at checkpoints and be much more in depth overall. Giving chatters a better story, while also allowing them multiple roll options with skill rolls tied into each class. (Things like barbarians are bad at thinking, but great at smashing! So they might not be the best at a stealth mission in a China shop...) </p> <p>2.) The bot now recognizes new chatters and greets them with fanfare and a little &quot;how to&quot; so they are not so confused when they first arrive. And the alert helps so I know they are a first time chatter! </p> <p>3.) I got all the skill rolls working, and now they are showing and updated in real time on the display. That way chatters can see at all times which skills are the best for this adventure they are on! </p> <p>4.) Bosses now display across the ENTIRE screen for the bot, being a big ol pain until they are defeated! </p> <p>5.) The druid weather effects now work, and have sounds on them (Some are very fun lol) and no longer spam repeats over and over. </p> <p>6.) Small bugs got fixed and many more popped up, so expect more updates soon(ish) </p> <p>You can check it out when I'm live sometime <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/thatturtlegm\">https://www.twitch.tv/thatturtlegm</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatTurtleGM\"> /u/ThatTurtleGM </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnwn2h/dd_twitch_bot_update_2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnwn2h/dd_twitch_bot_update_2/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
    "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

    "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

    "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

    "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
    "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

Here, we explored if there was any relationship between waking-life experiences related to elder relatives with both dreaming about elder relatives and dreaming about animals. For 1 day, 270 participants recorded waking-life experiences in daily diaries before sleeping and recorded their dreams upon waking. Two external judges rated if there was any content related to elder relatives or animals in both daily diaries and dreams. The most three frequent animals in dreams were dogs, cats, and snakes, or fishes, or birds. The frequency of waking-life experiences related to elder relatives was correlated with both the frequency of dreaming about elder relatives and the frequency of dreaming about animals. Yet, the latter two variables were not correlated with each other. The results supported the continuity hypothesis of dreaming. In addition, the results may suggest that some animals in dreams represented elder relatives in waking life metaphorically. Moreover, the results may support Carl Jung\u2019s idea that the image of animals in dreams may be a symbol of parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

A questionnaire was administered to 384 participants (mean age = 20.63 years, SD = 1.21; 205 females, 179 males), revealing that over half of them reported having sexual dreams, with a higher prevalence among males. The sexual dream group scored higher than the nonsexual dream group on aggressiveness, neuroticism, and sensation seeking. Furthermore, negative emotions, sensation seeking, activity, and extraversion play an important role in the perceived intensity of sexual dream experiences among sexual dreamers. These findings provide valuable insights for sexual education practitioners to understand individuals\u2019 sexual dream experiences and related psychological factors, contributing to scientific advancements in sexual health and education.

    "content": "In separate literature\u2014end-of-life experiences, dreams in bereavement, and continuing bonds in bereavement\u2014there are preliminary findings that both dreaming of the deceased and having an experiential encounter while awake are common experiences. The present, brief report is a post hoc analysis of previously unanalyzed items from two studies of bereaved individuals. One study focused on loss following the death of a romantic partner (n = 268) and the other following the death of a dog or cat (n = 199). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had dreamed of the deceased or had a waking experience of seeing, hearing, or feeling the touch of the deceased in the prior month. Consistent with prior research, a substantial portion of each sample (50.7% of the partner loss participants and 32.2% of the pet loss) reported at least one waking experience of seeing, hearing, and/or feeling the deceased. When dreaming of the deceased and/or having a waking experience of the deceased were combined, it was found to be 82.5% for partner loss and 68.2% for pet loss. Furthermore, dreaming about the deceased was related to having such waking experiences. These preliminary, exploratory findings contribute to the growing recognition that we need more research and theory into the function of such experiences for the bereaved and for those facing end of life.

    "content": "Our objective was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to enhance our comprehension of the Big Five personality traits that are associated with nightmare frequency and distress and might thus serve as risk factors for frequent and distressing nightmares. The inclusion criteria for studies were the use of a validated questionnaire to measure the Big Five personality traits and the measurement of nightmare distress and/or frequency in an adult population. Relevant studies were searched on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. Three-level meta-analyses were performed. Ten studies, all with a low risk of bias, were included. Due to the lack of studies on this topic, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on nightmare frequency with openness and neuroticism. The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and openness was z = 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.02, 0.10], p < .01). The pooled Fisher\u2019s z between nightmare frequency and neuroticism was z = 0.30 (95% CI [0.23, 0.38], p < .001). The association between nightmare frequency and neuroticism is small to moderate, while the association between nightmare frequency and openness is negligible to small. Our results imply that neuroticism is a greater predisposing factor for nightmare frequency than openness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This study compared the relative strength of these dispositions in predicting nightmare frequency. A sample of 116 university students completed measures of nightmare frequency, neuroticism, nightmare proneness, thin psychological boundaries, and sensory processing sensitivity. After accounting for sociodemographic variables and dream recall frequency, only nightmare proneness and thin boundaries significantly independently predicted nightmare frequency. These findings highlight the importance of nightmare proneness and thin boundaries as predictors, underscoring the need for further research with diverse samples to better understand these relationships.

This study investigates the impact of these crises on sleep patterns and dream experiences within Portugal\u2019s general adult population. Online surveys administered during both crises examined changes in sleep patterns, dream recall frequency, and characteristics of crisis-related dreams. The study involved 1,020 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and 703 participants during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Results reveal that while the pandemic significantly disrupted various life domains, including mental health, the war primarily impacted financial stability. Sleep disturbances unfolded during both crises, but pandemic-induced disruptions were more pronounced. Crisis-related dreams, characterized by fear and distress, were also more prevalent during the pandemic. Variations in crisis-related dream emotional and sensory content were identified. Anxiety was mainly associated with pandemic dreams, whereas sadness and anger characterized war-related dreams. These findings underscore the psychological ramifications of crises on sleep and dreams, emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health issues during tumultuous epochs. The study also suggests that monitoring sleep patterns and analyzing dream content can provide valuable insights into individuals\u2019 emotional processing of collective crises.

The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB) was a 7-month large-scale and highly traumatic social movement in Hong Kong that began in March 2019 in opposition to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government to amend its extradition laws. Using a sample of 112 Chinese young adult (74 females, 38 males, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.83) residents in Hong Kong, this article reports an investigation into relationships between trauma (as manifested in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), dream content (dream motifs, classified according to persecution or ego ideal delusional inclinations), and nightmare distress, all recalled by participants in relation to personal experiences of the Anti-ELAB. The hypothetical mediation models tested in the study confirm that the Anti-ELAB affected dream variables indirectly through trauma, including dream motifs modulated by persecution and ego ideal inclinations, offering critical insights into their dynamic interplay. Potential explanations for the findings as well as their implications for further research and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

    "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
    "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

    "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
    "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

    "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
    "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

    "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
    "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

    "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "title": "Modular inhibitory coding in binary networks",
    "content": "We developed and characterized properties of new class of binary models where, as observed in biological networks, excitatory neurons are functionally separated from inhibitory units. New patterns, represented as activation and inactivation of binary units in excitatory layer, are stored in the network through recruitment and training of inhibitory units that are group into individual modules and interact with excitatory layer. We investigate the roles the two populations play in memory storage and show that inhibitory layer plays a critical role in memory storage and management and that capacity of this new type of network scales with number of inhibitory neurons. Further, we show that performance of the network is only gradually diminished when excitatory to excitatory connections are removed, but critically depends on inhibitory to excitatory connections. These results are in line with new experimental work showing that inhibitory interneurons are playing critical role in memory storage and recall in the brain networks and may also address why generally excitatory networks exhibit sparser reciprocal connectivity as compared to connections to/from inhibitory units. We further show advantages of so designed coding shame in terms of memory capacity, its expansion with progressive storage of new memories as well as network behavior for large memory loading.",

    "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
    "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

    "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

    "content": "BackgroundPiloting is a highly specialized profession. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of longitudinal flight training on the cortical characteristics of the brain.MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging of 25 flight cadets and 24 controls was performed twice over a 2-year period. The gray matter thickness, cortical surface area and sulcal depth of the two groups were compared. The relationships between altered cortical characteristics and flight training days were investigated through correlation analysis.ResultsThe results indicated that flight training was associated with certain parameters of brain structure. Specifically, in the left rostral anterior cingulate area, the flight group displayed prominent gyri, whereas the control group exhibited sulci. The structural changes in these two groups followed completely opposite trends.ConclusionIn conclusion, the affected areas are primarily concentrated in brain regions associated with multisensory integration and multitasking, which may reflect neural adaptations induced by flight training.",

    "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

    "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

The Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (RCBAM) serves as the teacher network to extract high-dimensional spatial features via residual structures and channel\u2013spatial attention. The student network adopts a Temporal Convolutional Network\u2013LSTM (TCN\u2013LSTM) design, integrating dilated causal convolutions and two LSTM layers for efficient temporal modeling. Historical ADS-B trajectory data from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport are preprocessed using cubic spline interpolation and a uniform-step sliding window to ensure data alignment and temporal consistency. In the distillation process, soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations jointly guide student trainingResultsIn multi-step prediction experiments, the distilled RCBAM\u2013TCN\u2013LSTM model achieved average reductions of 40%\u201360% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared with the original RCBAM and TCN\u2013LSTM models, while improving R\u00b2 by 4%\u20136%. The approach maintained high accuracy across different prediction horizons while reducing computational complexity.DiscussionThe proposed method effectively balances high-precision modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies with lightweight deployment requirements, enabling real-time air-traffic monitoring and early warning on standard CPUs and embedded devices. This framework offers a scalable solution for enhancing the operational safety and efficiency of modern air-traffic control systems.",

    "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
    "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

    "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

    "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
    "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

    "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
    "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

    "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

    "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
    "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

    "title": "Neuroanatomical Correlates of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia",
    "content": "Background: Schizophrenia is characterized by widespread structural brain abnormalities, but associations between structural abnormalities and negative symptom severity are not well understood. Negative symptoms have been conceptualized in a hierarchical structure of two second-order dimensions -motivation and pleasure (MAP) and expression (EXP)- and five first-order domains: anhedonia, avolition, and asociality (MAP), and blunted affect and alogia (EXP). A better understanding of the neural circuitry underlying negative symptom dimensions and domains is important given their reported association with poor functional outcome and lack of available treatments. Study Design: The meta-analysis included 1,591 individuals with schizophrenia across 16 samples with structural imaging and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms data. The study generated correlations of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with the negative symptom dimensions and domains. Study results: Negative symptoms showed mainly negative associations with cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. The effect sizes were small but there was a pattern of associations in predominantly frontal lobe cortical thickness and limbic subcortical volumes. The regional correlation patterns of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with symptom domains support the conceptualized hierarchical structure of negative symptoms: correlations of MAP domains were stronger with the MAP than EXP dimension, and vice versa. Exploratory analyses with receptor densities further supported the hierarchy. Conclusion: Our findings reveal small but consistent associations between negative symptom dimensions and predominantly prefrontal region cortical thickness, and limbic region volumes. These findings advance our understanding of the network of anatomical regions that may contribute to the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",

    "title": "Timing precision of the Individual Differences in Dutch Language Skills (IDLaS-NL) test battery",
    "content": "Online experimentation has become an essential tool in cognitive psychology, offering access to diverse participant samples. However, remote testing introduces variability in stimulus presentation and response timing due to differences in participant hardware, browsers, and internet conditions. To ensure the validity of online studies, it is crucial to assess the timing precision of experimental software. The present study evaluates the Individual Differences in Dutch Language Skills (IDLaS-NL) test battery, a collection of online tests designed to measure linguistic experience, domain-general cognitive skills, and linguistic processing. Implemented using Frinex, a programming environment developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, IDLaS-NL allows researchers to customize test selections via a web platform. We conducted two studies to assess the timing precision of five chronometric tests within the battery. In Study 1, we evaluated the initial implementation of the tests, analyzing differences between expected and recorded stimulus presentation times, response latencies, and recording delays using the custom-made Web Experiment Analyzer (WEA). The results indicated imprecisions in some measures, particularly for reaction time and audio recording onset. Visual stimulus presentation, on the other hand, was fairly accurate. Study 2 introduced refined timing mechanisms in Frinex, incorporating specialized triggers for stimulus presentation and response registration. These adjustments improved timing precision, especially for speech production tasks. Overall, our findings confirm that Frinex achieves timing precision comparable to other widely used experimental platforms. While some variability in stimulus presentation and response timing is inherent to online testing, the results provide researchers with useful estimates of expected precision levels when using Frinex. This study contributes to the growing body of research on online testing methodologies by offering empirical insights into timing accuracy in web-based experiments.",

    "content": "IntroductionClinical studies assessing cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases require endpoints that are sensitive to treatment response across a broad range of cognitive abilities. However, responsiveness of conventional cognitive assessments typically varies with the performance level, especially due to non-linearities such as floor or ceiling effects. Here, we evaluate 6 newly developed smartphone-based and gamified Adaptive Cognitive Assessments (ACAs) entailing a system of dynamic difficulty adaptation to individual performance, which is expected to improve adherence but also measurement properties. Deployment of such ACAs to maximize their discriminative ability in comparative studies requires exploration of many free parameters and complex dynamics.MethodsIn simulations of cohorts of patients with cognitive impairment, we compared two ACAs paradigms: after 14 daily tests allowing performance-based difficulty adaptation, the difficulty level was either (1) fixed or (2) kept adaptive for a period of 4\u202fyears with weekly testing. Sensitivity to between-group effects was assessed in cohorts characterized by cognitive decline observed in neurodegenerative diseases.ResultsThe discriminative ability of the two paradigms depends on features of the study design and subjects. At study end, the adaptive difficulty paradigm clearly outperformed the fixed-difficulty paradigm in terms of responsiveness for cognitive decline rates >2.5% per year.DiscussionACA can increase biomarker responsiveness to treatment effects over fixed difficulty. ACA deployment should be guided by study and assessment features, including duration, expected cognitive decline rates and effect size. In the high-dimensional parameter space of ACA instruments, study simulations are indispensable to identify suitable deployment strategies.",

    "title": "Neuronal effects of epicranial current stimulation in macaque cortex",
    "content": "BackgroundTranscranial electrical stimulation (TES) using scalp electrodes is noninvasive, safe and inexpensive. However, because the scalp shunts most of the current, electric fields (E-fields) in the brain are relatively weak. Conversely, invasive neuromodulation methods such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and invasive cortical stimulation (ICS) successfully treat many brain diseases. However, the expensive and risky surgery limits the reach of these approaches. Epicranial current stimulation (ECS), where electrodes are implanted on the skull, is a novel approach which can bridge the gap between these two extremes. In current study we investigated the effects of ECS on neural activity.MethodsIn two macaque monkeys we implanted two concentric ring electrodes directly on the skull. Each electrode targeted one area PFG (PFG is not an acronym; rather it is the full name of a particular part of the parietal cortex) of the parietal convexity. Furthermore, a craniotomy was drilled in the skull to access the same area PFG. While recording (2\u202fmin) we stimulated (during the second recording minute) with a 10 or 40\u202fHz sinewave using an unfocused montage (between two electrodes on each side of the head) or a focused (through the concentric electrodes) over an intensity range of 0.25 to 4\u202fmA. These two montages allowed us to investigate neural responses to targeted and broad brain stimulation. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment we stimulated, at only 10\u202fHz, through an unfocused montage.ResultsOur results show that E-field strengths depended on a combination of montage and stimulation intensity. Depending on the montage stimulation caused entrainment as well as spike rate increases. For focused stimulation and unfocused stimulation at lower amplitudes neural activity became entrained to the stimulation (similar to TES). For the unfocused stimulation, as stimulation amplitude increased, spike-rates also increased (similar to ICS and DBS) while the unfocused did not affect spike rates. The fMRI study showed a distributed pattern of activations which is suggestive of a network response caused by ECS.ConclusionECS has been used as a proxy for transcutaneous stimulation in rodent setups. Here we show that as a standalone technique it can be applied to a larger and more complex brain. This makes it a promising neuromodulation approach with clinical applications in patients who do not respond to TES but are not yet candidates for ICS or DBS.",

    "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
    "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

    "title": "Motor unit number estimation based on convolutional neural network",
    "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

    "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

    "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

    "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
    "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

    "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
    "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Feature fusion based on global-local weighted attention model for automatic epileptic seizure detection",
    "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

In the primary visual cortex (V1), while most neurons are orientation-selective, a small portion exhibits a lack of this selectivity. However, it remains unclear what roles the orientation-untuned V1 neurons play in population orientation discrimination. Here, we analyzed data from a 2-photon calcium imaging study that recorded the responses of thousands of V1 neurons to a grating stimulus at various orientations...",

    "content": "<p><i>MiRNA</i>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <i>miRNAs</i> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <i>miR-153</i> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <i>miR-153</i> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <i>miR-153</i> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <i>miR-153</i> suppressed <i>KPNA5</i> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus.

    "content": "<p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Impact of Elovl5 Deficiency on Cerebellar Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice",
    "content": "<p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <i>Elovl5</i> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <i>Elovl5</i> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for \"gating\" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as \"filtering,\" was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <i>N-</i>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>",

    "title": "Effects of asymmetrical postural demands on sternocleidomastoid reflex in the startReact paradigm",
    "content": "IntroductionstartReact, the rapid release of a planned movement following a startling acoustic stimulus (usually >100 dB), is widely used to assess reticulospinal tract (RST) involvement in motor control. The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) reflex within 120 ms often identifies true startle responses, i.e., responses facilitated by RSTs in the absence of cortical control. However, as the SCM is a postural muscle, its reflexive activation may be influenced by inhibitory anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), particularly during tasks with greater head/neck postural demands.MethodsWe compared SCM activation during unilateral shoulder abduction (SABD) versus hand opening (OPEN) tasks. Due to the increased asymmetrical head/neck postural demands in SABD, we hypothesized an APA-induced delay in SCM activation during SABD compared to the OPEN task, with a contralateral bias due to contralateral cortical circuits triggering APAs.ResultsOur results revealed significantly longer SCM latency\u2014exceeding the 120 ms cutoff\u2014during SABD relative to OPEN. This suggested that APAs during postural tasks, resulting from unilateral SABD, altered the expression of the startReact response. To confirm this finding, we implemented an innovative, data-driven method to determine the appropriate SCM cutoff based on the physiological difference between startle-induced SCM reflexes and task-induced SCM activation. Using this method, we observed reduced contralateral SCM reflexive activation compared to ipsilateral, during SABD but not in OPEN.DiscussionThis provides evidence for the first time that SCM reflexive activation in startReact is posture-dependent. Our novel classification method offers a robust framework for identifying true startle responses across different tasks, offering broader applicability for studies investigating RST involvement in motor control.",

Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame.

    "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

In adulthood, female 5-HTT-deficient PS offspring and their wildtype littermates as well as age-matched control groups completed a behavioural test-battery, after which gene expression and histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) enrichment, as a marker of epigenetic programming, were measured in hippocampal tissue.ResultsDependent on the 5-Htt genotype, PS offspring showed decreased social behaviour in the 3-chamber sociability test. Notably, we observed a considerable degree of behavioural variation in the observed effect of PS in this social test, which allowed segregation into socially affected (SA) and socially unaffected (SU) mice. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of hippocampal tissue revealed a core set of 23 genes to be associated with genotype-specific variation in social behaviour following PS exposure. Whereas H3K4me3 levels did not show profound global changes in relation to the variable effects of PS exposure on social behaviour, the kinesin family member 14 (Kif14) gene, which displayed increased expression in socially unaffected wildtype mice, did show lower levels of H3K4me3 in those same mice, but not in any of the other groups.DiscussionAll in all, differential susceptibility linked to PS exposure displayed 5-Htt genotype-dependent behavioural and transcriptomic profiles, supporting the notion of 5-HT-dependent developmental programming.",

    "title": "Probing the roles of developmentally active neurons, in early-life adversity induced disruptions of adult behaviors",
    "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) is associated with subsequent mental health problems, and animal studies provide evidence for a causal role of ELA in the risk for mental illness, including persistent brain changes at molecular, cellular, network and functional levels. As enduring changes in cell function depend on orchestrated expression of genes, a robust body of research has focused on identifying the specific epigenetic and transcriptional programs through which ELA might induce brain changes. These studies have highlighted that the effects of ELA vary by brain region, cell-types and sex. Yet, while major advances were made in the past decade, the precise mechanisms through which ELA shapes the maturation and function of brain cells and their incorporation into circuits remain incompletely understood. Here, we discuss human and animal studies that focus on ELA-induced changes of the epigenome and transcriptome and explore recent technological advances that allow visualization and manipulation of neurons activated during ELA, at later stages of life. One such technology, Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP), enables precise and permanent genetic access to cells activated during specific sensitive developmental periods. Coupled with the appropriate tools, TRAP can be used to identify cellular transcriptional programs that are altered by the ELA experience in specific cell types and circuits, impacting cognitive and emotional brain functions enduringly. Understanding how ELA changes gene expression, circuit integration and function of neurons that are engaged by ELA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms employed by ELA to heighten the risk for mental illness later in life.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>I've put together <strong><a href=\"http://github.com/ashvardanian/StringWa.rs\">StringWa.rs</a></strong> \u2014 a benchmark suite for text and sequence processing in Python. It compares <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code> built-ins, popular third-party libraries, and GPU/SIMD-accelerated backends on common tasks like splitting, sorting, hashing, and edit distances between pairs of strings.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This is for Python developers working with text processing at any scale \u2014 whether you're parsing config files, building NLP pipelines, or handling large-scale bioinformatics data. If you've ever wondered why your string operations are bottlenecking your application, or if you're still using packages like NLTK for basic string algorithms, this benchmark suite will show you exactly what performance you're leaving on the table.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Many developers still rely on outdated packages like <code>nltk</code> (with 38 M monthly downloads) for Levenshtein distances, not realizing the same computation can be <strong>500\u00d7 faster on a single CPU core</strong> or up to <strong>160,000\u00d7 faster on a high-end GPU</strong>. The benchmarks reveal massive performance differences across the ecosystem, from built-in Python methods to modern alternatives like my own <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ashvardanian/StringZilla/\">StringZilla</a></strong> library (just released v4 under Apache 2.0 license after months of work).</p> <p>Some surprising findings for native <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code>: * <code>str.find</code> is about <strong>10\u00d7</strong> slower than it can be * On 4 KB blocks, using <code>re.finditer</code> to match byte-sets is <strong>46\u00d7</strong> slower * On same inputs, <code>hash(str)</code> is <strong>2\u00d7</strong> slower and has lower quality * <code>bytes.translate</code> for binary transcoding is <strong>4\u00d7</strong> slower</p> <p>Similar gaps exist in third-party libraries, like <code>jellyfish</code>, <code>google_crc32c</code>, <code>mmh3</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>pyarrow</code>, <code>polars</code>, and even Nvidia's own GPU-accelerated <code>cudf</code>, that (depending on the input) can be 100\u00d7 slower than <code>stringzillas-cuda</code> on the same H100 GPU.</p> <hr /> <p>I recently wrote 2 articles about the new algorithms that went into the v4 release, that received some positive feedback on &quot;<a href=\"/r/programming\">r/programming</a>&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nm3ath/processing_strings_109x_faster_than_nvidia_on_h100\">one</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmxdvf/how_a_string_library_beat_opencv_at_image\">two</a>), so I thought it might be worth sharing the underlying project on &quot;<a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>&quot; as well \ud83e\udd17</p> <p>This is in no way a final result, and there is a ton of work ahead, but let me know if I've overlooked important directions or libraries that should be included in the benchmarks!</p> <p>Thanks, Ash!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ashvar\"> /u/ashvar </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nocyn3/stringwars_which_libs_make_python_strings_210/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nocyn3/stringwars_which_libs_make_python_strings_210/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Altered Molecular Composition of a Specific Subset of Prefrontal Cortical Excitatory Synapses in Schizophrenia",
    "content": "<p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Language Information Representation within the Left Inferior Parietal Lobule Network: An Intracranial SEEG Study",
    "content": "<p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>",

    "title": "Characterization of Auditory Responsive Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus to White Noise and Frequency-Restricted Sounds",
    "content": "<p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>",

    "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
    "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

    "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
    "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-cq\"><code>python-cq</code></a> is a package that helps apply CQRS principles (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) in async Python projects.</p> <p>The core idea of CQRS is to separate:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Commands</strong> \u2192 actions that change the state of the system.</li> <li><strong>Queries</strong> \u2192 operations that only read data, without side effects.</li> <li><strong>Events</strong> \u2192 facts that describe something that happened, usually triggered by commands.</li> </ul> <p>With <code>python-cq</code>, handlers for commands, queries, and events are just regular Python classes decorated with <code>@command_handler</code>, <code>@query_handler</code>, or <code>@event_handler</code>. The framework automatically detects which message type is being handled based on type hints, no need to inherit from base classes or write boilerplate.</p> <p>It also integrates with dependency injection through <a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-injection\"><code>python-injection</code></a>, which makes it easier to manage dependencies between handlers.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```python from dataclasses import dataclass from injection import inject from cq import CommandBus, RelatedEvents, command_handler, event_handler</p> <p>@dataclass class UserRegistrationCommand: email: str password: str</p> <p>@dataclass class UserRegistered: user_id: int email: str</p> <p>@command<em>handler class UserRegistrationHandler: def __init</em>_(self, events: RelatedEvents): self.events = events</p> <pre><code>async def handle(self, command: UserRegistrationCommand): &quot;&quot;&quot; register the user &quot;&quot;&quot; user_id = ... event = UserRegistered(user_id, command.email) self.events.add(event) </code></pre> <p>@event_handler class SendConfirmationEmailHandler: async def handle(self, event: UserRegistered): &quot;&quot;&quot; send confirmation email &quot;&quot;&quot;</p> <p>@inject async def main(bus: CommandBus[None]): command = UserRegistrationCommand(email=&quot;<a href=\"mailto:root@gmail.com\">root@gmail.com</a>&quot;, password=&quot;root&quot;) await bus.dispatch(command) ```</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This library is intended for developers who want to experiment with CQRS principles in async Python projects. I think the project could be production-ready, but I need more feedback to be certain.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in clean architecture, domain-driven design, or simply curious about alternative ways to structure Python code, this might be useful.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most existing CQRS frameworks are designed for distributed systems or microservices, often bringing a lot of complexity with them. <code>python-cq</code> tries to stay different by being:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Minimal</strong>: just decorators, type annotations, and async.</li> <li><strong>Local-first</strong>: it works well for a single application.</li> <li><strong>Integrated with DI</strong>: works out of the box with <code>python-injection</code>.</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s trying to provide a simple, Pythonic way to use CQRS ideas in async projects.</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-cq\">https://github.com/100nm/python-cq</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Skearways\"> /u/Skearways </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnimms/pythoncq_lightweight_cqrs_package_for_async/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nnimms/pythoncq_lightweight_cqrs_package_for_async/\">[comments]</a></span>",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16779v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite being trained on vast amounts of data, most LLMs are unable to reliably generate well-designed UIs. Designer feedback is essential to improving performance on UI generation; however, we find that existing RLHF methods based on ratings or rankings are not well-aligned with designers' workflows and ignore the rich rationale used to critique and improve UI designs. In this paper, we investigate several approaches for designers to give feedback to UI generation models, using familiar interactions such as commenting, sketching and direct manipulation. We first perform a study with 21 designers where they gave feedback using these interactions, which resulted in ~1500 design annotations. We then use this data to finetune a series of LLMs to generate higher quality UIs. Finally, we evaluate these models with human judges, and we find that our designer-aligned approaches outperform models trained with traditional ranking feedback and all tested baselines, including GPT-5.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16778v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Tutor, a large language model (LLM)-powered tutoring system that combines an AI-based proof-review tutor for real-time feedback on proof-writing and a chatbot for mathematics-related queries. Our experiment, involving 148 students, demonstrated that the use of LLM-Tutor significantly improved homework performance compared to a control group without access to the system. However, its impact on exam performance and time spent on tasks was found to be insignificant. Mediation analysis revealed that students with lower self-efficacy tended to use the chatbot more frequently, which partially contributed to lower midterm scores. Furthermore, students with lower self-efficacy were more likely to engage frequently with the proof-review-AI-tutor, a usage pattern that positively contributed to higher final exam scores. Interviews with 19 students highlighted the accessibility of LLM-Tutor and its effectiveness in addressing learning needs, while also revealing limitations and concerns regarding potential over-reliance on the tool. Our results suggest that generative AI alone like chatbot may not suffice for comprehensive learning support, underscoring the need for iterative design improvements with learning sciences principles with generative AI educational tools like LLM-Tutor.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16772v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present an empirical study of how both experienced tutors and non-tutors judge the correctness of tutor praise responses under different Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted interfaces, types of explanation (textual explanations vs. inline highlighting). We first fine-tuned several Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce binary correctness labels and explanations, achieving up to 88% accuracy and 0.92 F1 score with GPT-4. We then let the GPT-4 models assist 95 participants in tutoring decision-making tasks by offering different types of explanations. Our findings show that although human-AI collaboration outperforms humans alone in evaluating tutor responses, it remains less accurate than AI alone. Moreover, we find that non-tutors tend to follow the AI's advice more consistently, which boosts their overall accuracy on the task: especially when the AI is correct. In contrast, experienced tutors often override the AI's correct suggestions and thus miss out on potential gains from the AI's generally high baseline accuracy. Further analysis reveals that explanations in text reasoning will increase over-reliance and reduce underreliance, while inline highlighting does not. Moreover, neither explanation style actually has a significant effect on performance and costs participants more time to complete the task, instead of saving time. Our findings reveal a tension between expertise, explanation design, and efficiency in AI-assisted decision-making, highlighting the need for balanced approaches that foster more effective human-AI collaboration.",

Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone. This research contributes empirically-grounded design recommendations to improve comparison in health risk communication and support more informed decision-making across domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Empathy is increasingly recognized as a key factor in human-AI communication, yet conventional approaches to \"digital empathy\" often focus on simulating internal, human-like emotional states while overlooking the inherently subjective, contextual, and relational facets of empathy as perceived by users. In this work, we propose a human-centered taxonomy that emphasizes observable empathic behaviors and introduce a new dataset, Sense-7, of real-world conversations between information workers and Large Language Models (LLMs), which includes per-turn empathy annotations directly from the users, along with user characteristics, and contextual details, offering a more user-grounded representation of empathy. Analysis of 695 conversations from 109 participants reveals that empathy judgments are highly individualized, context-sensitive, and vulnerable to disruption when conversational continuity fails or user expectations go unmet. To promote further research, we provide a subset of 672 anonymized conversation and provide exploratory classification analysis, showing that an LLM-based classifier can recognize 5 levels of empathy with an encouraging average Spearman $\\rho$=0.369 and Accuracy=0.487 over this set. Overall, our findings underscore the need for AI designs that dynamically tailor empathic behaviors to user contexts and goals, offering a roadmap for future research and practical development of socially attuned, human-centered artificial agents.",

While prior work has extensively studied machine learning workflows, the everyday practices of optimization model developers (OMDs) have received little attention. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 OMDs across diverse domains to examine how optimization is done in practice. Our findings reveal a highly iterative workflow spanning six stages: problem elicitation, data processing, model development, implementation, validation, and deployment. Importantly, we find that optimization practice is not only about algorithms that deliver better decisions, but is equally shaped by data and dialogue - the ongoing communication with stakeholders that enables problem framing, trust, and adoption. We discuss opportunities for future tooling that foregrounds data and dialogue alongside decision-making, opening new directions for human-centered optimization.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16323v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding the broad impact of science and science funding is critical to ensuring that science investments and policies align with societal needs. Existing research links science funding to the output of scientific publications but largely leaves out the downstream uses of science and the myriad ways in which investing in science may impact human society. As funders seek to allocate scarce funding resources across a complex research landscape, there is an urgent need for informative and transparent tools that allow for comprehensive assessments and visualization of the impact of funding. Here we present Funding the Frontier (FtF), a visual analysis system for researchers, funders, policymakers, university leaders, and the broad public to analyze multidimensional impacts of funding and make informed decisions regarding research investments and opportunities. The system is built on a massive data collection that connects 7M research grants to 140M scientific publications, 160M patents, 10.9M policy documents, 800K clinical trials, and 5.8M newsfeeds, with 1.8B citation linkages among these entities, systematically linking science funding to its downstream impacts. As such, Funding the Frontier is distinguished by its multifaceted impact analysis framework. The system incorporates diverse impact metrics and predictive models that forecast future investment opportunities into an array of coordinated views, allowing for easy exploration of funding and its outcomes. We evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the system using case studies and expert interviews. Feedback suggests that our system not only fulfills the primary analysis needs of its target users, but the rich datasets of the complex science ecosystem and the proposed analysis framework also open new avenues for both visualization and the science of science research.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16803v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used to separate mixed signals and recover statistically independent components. However, in non-human primate neuroimaging studies, most ICA-recovered spatial maps are often dense. To extract the most relevant brain activation patterns, post-hoc thresholding is typically applied-though this approach is often imprecise and arbitrary. To address this limitation, we employed the Sparse ICA method, which enforces both sparsity and statistical independence, allowing it to extract the most relevant activation maps without requiring additional post-processing. Simulation experiments demonstrate that Sparse ICA performs competitively against 11 classical linear ICA methods. We further applied Sparse ICA to real non-human primate neuroimaging data, identifying several independent component networks spanning different brain networks. These spatial maps revealed clearly defined activation areas, providing further evidence that Sparse ICA is effective and reliable in practical applications.",

It is a worthwhile technique in medical and psychological research, but also relatively niche. Here we present a tutorial on the acquisition and analysis of the human electrogastrogram. Because dedicated equipment and software can be prohibitively expensive, we demonstrate how data can be acquired using a low-cost OpenBCI Ganglion amplifier. We also present a processing pipeline that minimises attrition, which is particularly helpful for low-cost equipment but also applicable to top-of-the-line hardware. Our approach comprises outlier rejection, frequency filtering, movement filtering, and noise reduction using independent component analysis. Where traditional approaches include a subjective step in which only one channel is manually selected for further analysis, our pipeline recomposes the electrogastrogram from all recorded channels after automatic rejection of nuisance components. The main benefits of this approach are reduced attrition, retention of data from all recorded channels, and reduced influence of researcher bias. In addition to our tutorial on the method, we offer a proof-of-principle in which our approach leads to reduced data rejection compared to established methods. We aimed to describe each step in sufficient detail to be implemented in any programming language. In addition, we made an open-source Python package freely available for ease of use.",

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.",

This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely \"remembering\" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.",

This issue is particularly important in small-sample settings, as most datasets fall into this category. We compare models with three major inductive biases in deep learning including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers for the task of biological sex classification. These models are evaluated within a unified pipeline using parcellated multivariate fMRI time series from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7-Tesla cohort, which includes four resting-state runs and four movie-watching task runs. We assess performance on Whole-brain, subcortex, and 12 functional networks. CNNs consistently achieved the highest discrimination for sex classification in both resting-state and movie-watching, while LSTM and Transformer models underperformed. Network-resolved analyses indicated that the Whole-brain, Default Mode, Cingulo-Opercular, Dorsal Attention, and Frontoparietal networks were the most discriminative. These results were largely similar between resting-state and movie-watching. Our findings indicate that, at this dataset size, discriminative information is carried by local spatial patterns and inter-regional dependencies, favoring convolutional inductive bias.

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

    "content": "arXiv:2509.16238v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Network analysis of human brain connectivity indicates that individual differences in cognitive abilities arise from neurobiological mechanisms inherent in structural and functional brain networks. Existing studies routinely treat structural connectivity (SC) as optimal or fixed topological scaffolds for functional connectivity (FC), often overlooking higher-order dependencies between brain regions and limiting the modeling of complex cognitive processes. Besides, the distinct spatial organizations of SC and FC complicate direct integration, as naive alignment may distort intrinsic nonlinear patterns of brain connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment (EDT-PA), designed to identify disease-specific connectome patterns and classify brain disorders. To accurately model high-order structural dependencies, EDT-PA incorporates a spectrum of evolvable modeling blocks to dynamically capture high-order dependencies across brain regions. Additionally, a Pattern-Specific Alignment mechanism employs optimal transport to align structural and functional representations in a geometry-aware manner. By incorporating a Kolmogorov-Arnold network for flexible node aggregation, EDT-PA is capable of modeling complex nonlinear interactions among brain regions for downstream classification. Extensive evaluations on the REST-meta-MDD and ADNI datasets demonstrate that EDT-PA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more effective framework for revealing structure-function misalignments and disorder-specific subnetworks in brain disorders.

    "title": "Emotions are Recognized Patterns of Cognitive Activities",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.16232v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Emotions play a crucial role in human life. The research community has proposed many theories on emotions without reaching much consensus. The situation is similar for emotions in cognitive architectures and autonomous agents. I propose in this paper that emotions are recognized patterns of cognitive activities. These activities are responses of an agent to the deviations between the targets of its goals and the performances of its actions. Emotions still arise even if these activities are purely logical. I map the patterns of cognitive activities to emotions. I show the link between emotions and attention and the impacts of the parameterized functions in the cognitive architecture on the computing of emotions. My proposition bridges different theories on emotions and advances the building of consensus.",

    "title": "Hippocampal functional connectivity changes associated with active and lecture-based physics learning",
    "content": "Introductory university physics courses often face the dual challenge of introducing students to new physics concepts while also addressing their preconceived notions that conflict with scientific principles. Active learning pedagogical approaches, which employ constructivist principles and emphasize active participation in the learning process, have been shown to be effective in teaching complex physics concepts. However, while the behavioral effects of constructivist methodologies are largely understood, the neurobiological underpinnings that facilitate this process remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed students enrolled in either an active learning or lecture-based physics course before and after a 15-week semester of learning and examined changes in hippocampal whole-brain connectivity. We focused on the hippocampus given its critical role in learning and memory. Our findings revealed that hippocampal connectivity with brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes decreased over time, regardless of instructional approach. Results also indicated that active learning students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with parietal, cerebellar, and frontal regions, reflecting experiential learning based on constructivist principles, whereas lecture-based students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus, suggesting learning through passive observation. Our findings demonstrate that while some aspects of hippocampal functional connectivity may decrease over time, active vs. passive learning may preferentially enhance hippocampal connectivity during physics learning.",

    "title": "A pilot study on simultaneous stimulation of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area using gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation to improve gait variability in post-stroke hemiparetic patients",
    "content": "IntroductionGait impairment is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. While walking speed is a key indicator of recovery, gait variability is closely associated with fall risk and long-term functional decline. Previous studies have suggested that functional interaction between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in post-stroke gait control. Rather than stimulating these regions independently, simultaneous activation of the SMA\u2014critical for rhythm modulation and motor planning\u2014and gait-synchronized stimulation of the M1\u2014essential for motor execution\u2014may offer enhanced benefits for gait stability.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a combined brain stimulation intervention targeting the SMA and M1 on gait variability and balance in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis.MethodsSixteen individuals with stroke within 180 days after the onset, aged 40\u201390 years, who were able to walk on a treadmill were recruited in this study of multi-center, randomized, controlled pilot trial with a parallel-group design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) receiving 20 min of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the SMA and gait-synchronized rhythmic stimulation to the M1 during treadmill walking, or to a control group (n = 8) receiving sham stimulation. Both groups underwent 15 sessions of walking practice over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment, retention, adherence and adverse events and preliminary estimates of effect on gait variability such as coefficient of variation for stride, stance, and swing times on the paretic side. Balance was assessed using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).ResultsAll 16 participants completed the intervention without adverse events, indicating high feasibility. The intervention group showed significantly reduced stride time variability on the paretic side and improved Mini-BESTest scores compared to the control group. A significant correlation was observed between reductions in gait variability and improvements in balance.ConclusionsThis pilot trial supports the feasibility and safety of a combined SMA and M1 stimulation approach. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in reducing gait variability and improving balance after stroke, warranting further investigation in a definitive trial.",

    "title": "Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) for spastic cerebral palsy",
    "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",

    "title": "Brain structure correlates of foreign language learning experiences",
    "content": "Previous research demonstrates that bilingual experiences produce dynamic and variable structural adaptations in the brain. However, most studies focus on individuals who naturally acquire multiple languages, leaving the neural effects of long-term foreign language learners with limited exposure less understood. In this study, we examined 32 young adult long-term foreign language learners in South Korea to determine how age of acquisition, proficiency, and daily use shape gray matter volume and white matter integrity in predominantly monolingual environments. We found structural changes in brain regions involved in language control and executive function. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that earlier foreign language acquisition was significantly associated with greater gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p < 0.001) and the left thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001). Higher daily use was significantly associated with greater volume in the right inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p = 0.001) but reduced it in the right anterior cingulate cortex (uncorrected p < 0.001). Tract-based spatial statistics analysis further showed that earlier age of acquisition was significantly associated with better white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.009), while higher daily use was significantly associated with better integrity in the body of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.030). These findings suggest that even limited but sustained exposure to a foreign language can lead to significant structural adaptations, broadening our understanding of language-related neuroplasticity beyond traditional bilingual contexts.",

    "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by neuroscience principles, have gained attention for their energy efficiency. However, directly trained SNNs lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy for complex tasks like object detection due to the limited information capacity of binary spike feature maps. To address this, we propose BD-SNN, a new directly trained SNN equipped with Bidirectional Dynamic Threshold neurons (BD-LIF). BD-LIF neurons emit +1 and \u20131 spikes and dynamically adjust their thresholds, enhancing the network's information encoding capacity and activation efficiency. Our BD-SNN incorporates two new all-spike residual blocks, BD-Block1 and BD-Block2, for efficient information extraction and multi-scale feature fusion, respectively. Experiments on the COCO and Gen1 datasets demonstrate that BD-SNN improves accuracy by 3.1% and 2.8% compared to the state-of-the-art EMS-YOLO method, respectively, validating BD-SNN's superior performance across diverse input scenarios. Project will be available at https://github.com/Ganpei576/BD-SNN.",
