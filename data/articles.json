    "title": "Developmental changes in the morphology and three-dimensional arrangement of antennal hair plates in crickets",
    "content": "Antennae of insects are essential mechanosensory organs that facilitate active tactile exploration and spatial navigation. Hair-plate sensilla at the base of the antenna flagellum provide proprioceptive inputs to detect their position. In hemimetabolous insects, such as crickets, the first instar immediately after hatching also possesses antennae, but the developmental dynamics and spatial organization of antennal hair plates remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis of the antennal hair plates in crickets across developmental stages, from the first instar to adulthood. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we demonstrated that hair plate sensilla were present from the first instars and maintained a highly stereotyped spatial arrangement throughout development. Three-dimensional quantification revealed that new sensilla added during molting were formed at specific sites within the hair plate clusters that had existed at the previous stage, maintaining the spatial pattern despite the substantial growth of the antenna. Multidimensional analyses indicated that the spatial arrangement of sensilla was consistent across individuals, suggesting that organization was genetically determined. Retrograde labeling of sensory afferents showed that sensory neurons in the hair plates converged their axons, extended axon collaterals into the ipsilateral region of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, and ultimately projected to the subesophageal ganglion. There was no apparent difference in their projection site among hair plates, suggesting no evidence of topographic organization. Our findings highlight the conserved spatial organization of hair-plate sensilla in crickets, suggesting a robust proprioceptive system that provides reliable feedback of antennal position throughout development.",

    "title": "Temporal Dynamics of High-Frequency Oscillations in Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Study in hAPP-J20 Mice",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and increased seizure susceptibility; yet both the mechanistic and temporal links between AD and epileptogenesis remain poorly defined. In this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of epileptogenesis in relation to AD pathology using hAPP-J20 transgenic mice aged 9 to 27 weeks, encompassing the AD conversion phase. Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) was employed to monitor hippocampal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), including ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-600 Hz), in conjunction with histological, behavioral, and neurophysiological assessments to characterize underlying neural circuit alterations. We identified three distinct epileptogenic stages in transgenic mice: (1) 9-15 weeks: emerging memory deficits, increased excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuron ratio, mossy fiber sprouting, and peak seizure-related mortality, alongside the initial emergence of pathological HFOs; (2) 15-21 weeks: a pronounced escalation of pathological HFO activity and persistent network hyperexcitability preceding detectable amyloid plaque deposition, indicating rapid epileptogenic progression; (3) 21-27 weeks: stabilization of HFO activity despite continued progression of amyloid accumulation, suggesting a plateau in epileptogenic remodeling amid advancing Alzheimer's pathology. These findings indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability precedes amyloid plaque deposition and likely contributes to disease progression, highlighting a critical early window for therapeutic intervention in AD. Moreover, pathological HFOs hold promise as electrophysiological biomarkers of early circuit dysfunction and represent a promising target for modifying the course of AD.",

    "title": "Proficiency-Dependent and Dynamic Reorganization of Brain Networks During Children's Second Language Learning",
    "content": "Children's second language (L2) vocabulary learning is often indexed with event-related potentials (ERPs) by the N400 incongruity effect, yet its stability in real classrooms is unclear. We recorded 64-channel EEG from 42 children (aged 9-15 years) during a translation-recognition task before and after a regular instructional vocabulary unit and sub-grouped children by baseline proficiency. We quantified the canonical N400 (300-500 ms, centroparietal region of interest; ROI) alongside electrical-neuroimaging indices of ERP strength and topography (Global Field Power, Global Map Dissimilarity, ERP template-map preponderance), using adult template maps from a prior study as a normative reference. Behaviorally, children showed large gains in vocabulary accuracy and higher discrimination sensitivity (d') in post-assessment. The classical N400 incongruity effect did not increase from pre- to post-learning. By contrast, global and topographic measures were learning-sensitive: Global Field Power increased across sessions and interacted with proficiency, and Global Map Dissimilarity showed main effects of session and proficiency as well as their interaction, indicating proficiency-dependent topographic reorganization. Adult normative template maps backfitted well; within the N400 window, high-proficiency children more consistently occupied an adult-like configuration; later (~650-800 ms), patterns also differentiated by proficiency and congruency. Relative to adults, children exhibited more diffuse topographies and stronger dependence on individual proficiency. In classroom settings, children's L2 vocabulary learning is therefore more sensitively indexed by scalp topography and global field dynamics than by a single N400 amplitude, positioning electrical neuroimaging as a proficiency-dependent, classroom-relevant marker of L2 acquisition.",

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

    "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound of the Human Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Reconfigures Resting State Connectivity: A Sham-Controlled fMRI Study",
    "content": "Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) can modulate human brain activity, but its impact on large-scale functional connectivity (FC) in vivo remains incompletely characterized. Here we asked whether brief tFUS to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) modulates its FC with other brain regions. In a sham-controlled, within-subject study of healthy adults (N=16), we measured resting-state blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, during, and after five minutes of tFUS (i.e., five 20-second sonications followed by 40 second pauses). Subject-level sgACC-whole-brain FC was analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model (fixed: time, condition, time x condition; random: subject). tFUS increased sgACC-whole brain connectivity after sonication relative to sham. A smaller, non-significant trend was observed during sonication. Baseline-controlled analyses were employed to rule out the possibility that the observed increase in FC was due to a \"regression to the mean\" effect. Interestingly, network-level analysis revealed a clear disassociation in the evolution of resting-state FC across the 15 minute recordings: during sham sessions, the sgACC's connectivity with the default mode network (DMN) increased, while FC with other networks was largely unchanged. On the other hand, active tFUS led to a notable increase in FC with non-DMN networks (especially the cognitive control network), while connectivity with the DMN was stable. These results provide whole-brain evidence that tFUS reconfigures network dynamics in the human brain, motivating clinical applications to disorders characterized by dysregulated brain activity.",

    "title": "The cyclic nucleotide binding sites of Swiss-Cheese, the Drosophila orthologue of human PNPLA6, are required for its catalytic function",
    "content": "Mutations in Swiss-cheese (SWS) or its vertebrate ortholog PNLPA6, also called Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE), cause progressive neuronal degeneration in Drosophila and mice and several complex syndromes in humans. These include mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, ataxia and blindness and several other symptoms. SWS and PNPLA6 are widely expressed in neurons and in several glial cell types in Drosophila and mice and both cell types require SWS/PNPLA6 function autonomously. SWS and PNPLA6 are structurally and functionally conserved because expression of human or mouse PNPLA6 can replace SWS in flies. These orthologues share several domains, including the highly conserved phospholipase domain that mediates its function in deacetylating phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine. In addition, they share three cyclic nucleotide binding sites and although about 10% of the known disease-causing mutations occur in these sites, their function is still unknown. We therefore generated mutations in these sites in SWS to address what consequences this has for the function of the protein. Mutating only one site (SWSG558E) results in a partially functional protein that rescues the sws knockdown and that decreases PC when overexpressed. However, mutating all three sites (SWS{Delta}CNB) renders SWS non-functional and results in an increase of PC when overexpressed, suggesting that cyclic nucleotide binding can regulate the phospholipase function.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Community Structure of the Adult Drosophila Connectome Reveals Conserved Circuit Archetypes",
    "content": "Biological neural networks can be meaningfully partitioned into sub-networks referred to as communities. Community structure is thought to support functional specialization, adaptability, and cost-efficient wiring. While many studies have focused on inter-regional brain networks, little is known about communities in connectomes mapped at the level of individual neurons and synapses. Here, we analyze the whole-brain Drosophila adult connectome using a nested stochastic block model to uncover its hierarchical community structure. We find that most of the roughly 1500 fine-scale communities--the smallest, and best resolved level of the hierarchy--are spatially compact, generally assortative, and aligned with known biological features such as neurotransmitter identity and cell type. Nonetheless, we find evidence of nonassortative communities, spatially co-localized within the optic lobe and vision-processing pathways. Seeking \"functional primitives\"--small circuits with functionally narrow feature profiles--we use data-driven clustering to group communities into 45 archetypical meta-clusters based on their spatial, functional, and molecular properties, revealing modular building blocks from which larger, functionally diverse communities are composed. This work advances our understanding of how structure and function are organized in the fruit fly brain and highlights the value of statistical network models in interpreting nanoscale connectomes.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "content": "Neurons are highly polarised cells that depend on mitochondria for energy and signalling homeostasis. Importantly, energy and signalling requirements vary considerably across individual neurons both spatially and temporally. Therefore, to fully understand neuronal mitochondria, methods are needed to analyse mitochondria in live cells over time. The nanotweezer, a minimally invasive single-cell sampling technique, enables precise extraction a individual mitochondria from defined subcellular locations. Here, we combine single-mitochondrial extraction from live neurons with mitochondrial gene expression tracking and mtDNA profiling. By tracking mitochondrial gene expression in the same neurons over time, we reveal a downregulation of mitochondrial genes MT-ND1 and MT-ATP6 following exposure to -synuclein aggregates, independent of the proximity of the aggregates to the sampled mitochondria. Our approach provides precise, dynamic measurements of mitochondrial composition and gene expression in vivo at single-organelle resolution, enabling mechanistic studies of neuronal mitochondrial heterogeneity and its perturbation in models of neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Tau oligomer heterogeneity and associated protein profile in slowly versus rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease",
    "content": "Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) is a rare but devastating clinical variant characterized by abrupt cognitive decline, yet the molecular features underlying this phenotype remain unknown. Tau oligomers (TauO) are key mediators of tau toxicity, but whether their biochemical properties differ across AD subtypes has not been examined in human brain. We isolated endogenous TauO from frontal cortex of well-characterized control, slowly progressive AD (spAD), and rpAD cases using T22 immunoprecipitation and performed ultrastructural, biochemical, and proteomic characterization. rpAD TauO displayed compact, densely aggregated morphology and exhibited the highest levels of disease-associated phosphorylation (pS396, pS422). Label-free proteomics revealed that control and spAD shared a robust TauO interactome enriched for translation, proteostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and vesicle trafficking. Strikingly, these modules were absent in rpAD, which instead showed selective enrichment for aldehyde detoxification, amino-acid and carbon metabolism, and actin-regulatory pathways. rpAD TauO demonstrated increased association with SERPINA1, ALDH9A1, MAPRE3, DPYSL2/3, and NFASC, and reduced association with MRPL17 and C9. Functionally, rpAD TauO induced the strongest toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these findings indicate that rpAD likely harbors a biochemically distinct TauO species, defining a molecular signature that may underpin its fulminant clinical progression and support the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Melanopsin contributes to circadian photic responses in mice in a sex-dependent manner",
    "content": "Proper entrainment of the body's circadian rhythms to the environment is critical to human health. Light is one of the strongest cues driving circadian photoentrainment of the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via projections from the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Circadian research has historically centered males, and recent work has revealed multiple sex-differences in circadian circuitry and function, indicating that our understanding of this system in females is severely limited. Moreover, while recent studies have investigated the role of hormonal modulation of light responses, the additional possibility that ipRGC inputs may also be sex-dependent has not been directly tested. Here, we report that not only do ipRGCs in female mice show higher levels of melanopsin expression, but that melanopsin also plays a larger role in shaping circadian photic responses in females compared to males. Collectively, these results define a new retinal source for sex-dependent differences in circadian behavior.",

    "content": "Neuropeptides contribute to the functional complexity of the nucleus accumbens, and evaluating the mechanisms by which they influence reward neurocircuitry may reveal novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the role of the neuropeptide precursor VGF (non-acronymic) in the nucleus accumbens, and its contribution to synaptic and opioid-evoked plasticity and behavior. We first characterized VGF expression within the nucleus accumbens, then examined its impact on excitatory synaptic transmission, and finally disrupted its expression to assess its influence on opioid sensitivity. We found that VGF is expressed by interneurons and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, and the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 reduced excitatory synaptic transmission onto nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons. Conditional genetic knockout of VGF from the nucleus accumbens did not affect acute opioid sensitivity, but amplified opioid-evoked psychomotor sensitization following chronic fentanyl exposure. These results establish VGF as a modulator of nucleus accumbens synaptic and drug-evoked plasticity. Uncovering the impact of VGF on nucleus accumbens plasticity following exogenous opioid exposure may lead to novel therapeutic targets to treat opioid use disorders.",

    "title": "Functional implications of compartment-specific homeostatic regulation and the feasibility of independent local feedback signals",
    "content": "Neurons regulate their average firing rate by adjusting their synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability. Both forms of homeostatic regulation utilize changes in intracellular calcium as a feedback signal to adjust ion channel densities. But two properties cannot be independently regulated using a single feedback signal, suggesting that either synaptic scaling and excitability regulation are linked by a shared feedback signal or that local calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Past studies on homeostatic regulation have focused on global calcium changes but spatially restricted calcium changes also occur. We hypothesized that local perturbation-induced calcium changes encode separate feedback signals. Simulations in a simple two-compartment model confirmed that a perturbation applied to one or the other compartment induces local compensation only if the feedback is compartment-specific. Simulations in a biophysically detailed multicompartment model with realistic calcium handling confirmed that dendritic and somatic calcium signals remain relatively segregated and can, therefore, mediate homoeostatic regulation independently in subcellular compartments. Strong perturbations (as often tested experimentally) triggered widespread compensation because local compensation was overwhelmed. Non-local compensation also occurred when the spatial segregation of calcium signaling was weakened. Our results demonstrate the plausibility of spatially segregated calcium changes encoding separate feedback signals so that homeostatic changes can be locally controlled. Our results also highlight that whereas local homeostatic regulation nullifies local perturbations through compensation within the affected compartment, non-local regulation causes widespread compensatory changes that, while restoring the neuron's overall input-output relationship, distorts the input-output relationship of individual compartments, with potentially important consequences.",

    "title": "Neuronal APOE4 reduction with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
    "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within the central nervous system (CNS), APOE is produced by a variety of cell types, with differential roles in AD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that APOE4 produced by neurons plays a central role in promoting the development of major AD pathologies, including p-tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role as an upstream initiating factor that affects other cell types and downstream AD-related pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting APOE-I3, a neuron-specific splicing variant of APOE mRNA, effectively reduce APOE expression in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Treating PS19 tauopathy mice expressing APOE4 with this APOE-I3-targeting ASO reduces neuronal APOE4, rescues neurodegeneration, and diminishes neuroinflammation. Strikingly, the extent of neuronal APOE4 reduction predicts the efficacy of rescuing neurodegeneration. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated that APOE-I3-targeting ASO treatment decreases disease associated neuronal and glial subtypes and increases a disease-protective microglial subtype. These findings suggest that preferential knockdown of neuronal APOE4 with an APOE-I3-targeting ASO protects against key hallmarks of AD pathology, elucidating a potential therapeutic approach for treating APOE4-driven AD.",

    "title": "TARGETING 5-HT7 RECEPTOR WITH BIASED LIGANDS TO ALLEVIATE PAIN AND SPINAL NEUROINFLAMMATION",
    "content": "The serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and represents a promising target for treating CNS disorders such as sleep disturbances, migraine, neuropsychiatric conditions, and neuropathic pain. Owing to its therapeutic potential, extensive efforts have focused on developing selective 5-HT7R ligands. In the last decades, biased signalling has emerged as a key concept in GPCR pharmacology as biased ligands can stabilize specific active states of the receptor and trigger selective activation of downstream signaling pathways. In this context, we recently identified two biased 5-HT7R ligands, Serodolin and MOA51, from different chemical series. Here, we aimed to compare the pharmacological and safety profiles of these ligands and to assess their effect on pain-related behaviors and spinal neuroinflammation. In inflammatory pain models (acid acetic writhing, formalin and CFA tests), both serodolin and MOA51 effectively attenuated pain responses to a similar extend. Furthermore, in neuropathic pain models, spinal nerve injury (SNI) and Cuff model, both ligands reversed mechanical allodynia. Interestingly, unlike pregabalin, a clinically used reference drug, neither Serodolin nor MOA51 induced apparent tolerance after 10 consecutive days of administration. Treatment with these 5-HT7R ligands also reduced spinal microglial and attenuated neuronal hyperactivity in the spinal cord. Altogether these findings highlight the potential of 5-HT7R-biased ligands as promising analgesic candidates capable of modulating neuroinflammatory processes and mitigating both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.",

    "title": "Patterns of brain-wide associations reflect socioeconomics",
    "content": "Previous brain wide association studies (BWAS) cross sectionally linked a specific behavioral trait, most commonly IQ or psychopathology, to variation in brain function or structure. Here, we expanded the focus of BWAS from effect sizes to interpretability and generalizability by mapping 649 variables to brain function and structure. We compared the resultant BWAS maps to other types of brain data to annotate the BWAS patterns. Socioeconomic status (SES), not IQ or psychopathology, showed the strongest associations with both resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cortical thickness in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. A principal exposome brain pattern, anchored to sensory and motor cortex, captured 34% of the variance across all BWAS maps. This exposome pattern was strongly correlated with the SES and IQ BWAS maps and non BWAS maps of sleep (EEG), norepinephrine (PET), and stimulants (drug trial), but not cognitive activation maps (task fMRI). Adjusting for SES, reduced brain with IQ associations by 40%. Brain with IQ associations did not generalize, as they could no longer be detected in subsamples drawn from only higher SES backgrounds, while brain with SES associations remained strong in higher IQ only subsamples. These findings reveal SES as the principal axis of population level brain variation, possibly stemming from the sleep deprivation and heightened stress associated with lower SES, since socioeconomics can only indirectly affect the brain.",

    "title": "Beta2* Nicotinic Receptors Tune Prefrontal Behavior Through Distinct Neuronal Populations",
    "content": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing beta2 subunit (beta2* nAChRs) are widely expressed in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), where they regulate behavioral and cognitive domains associated with this region and represent potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, current pharmacological tools cannot distinguish among receptors expressed by different neuronal populations, and the functional roles of beta2* nAChRs in specific neuronal types remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the expression and behavioral significance of beta2* nAChRs in distinct neuronal populations of the mouse PFC. We first used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the expression of the beta2 nicotinic subunit in major neuronal types and cortical layers. We then used CRISPR to knock down (KD) the beta2 subunit in two PFC populations and, for comparison, in a striatal population. KD of the beta2 subunit in deep-layer PFC neurons defined by neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression specifically altered working memory and exploratory behavior and affected social and anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, KD in PFC interneurons expressing serotonin receptor 5HT3a led to a hypersocial phenotype. KD of beta2* nAChRs in a rare NPY-expressing striatal population resulted in subtler and largely opposing changes in similar behavioral domains. These findings show that beta2* nAChRs expressed by distinct neuronal populations contribute differentially, and sometimes oppositely, to behavioral regulation. Our data suggest that cell-type- and region-specific expression of beta2* nAChRs is required for the modulation and fine-tuning of behavioral domains relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Over-Reliance on Prior Expectations in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis",
    "content": "Cognitive impairment is a common and disabling feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bayesian models of perception and action provide a powerful framework to better understand how cognitive processes are altered in MS. In this study, we employed a time reproduction paradigm within a Bayesian framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We applied a modified Bayesian observer model, which partitions time reproduction into three stages: sensory measurement, time estimation, and motor response. We found that both MS and control groups showed a systematic bias in reproducing time, overestimating short intervals and underestimating long intervals. This bias was significantly larger in patients with MS compared with controls, reflecting an over-reliance on prior expectations relative to sensory-motor information. Computational modeling indicated that this increased bias in the MS group was driven by greater measurement noise during the sensory stage. Moreover, central tendency bias increases with age in healthy participants as reliance on prior expectations becomes stronger than sensory-motor evidence. Interestingly, we found that this age-related effect on bias was absent in patients with MS. Further analysis showed both younger and older patients performed equally biased, and their performance was similar to older healthy participants.",

    "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "title": "Retraining dorsal visual pathways improves cognitive skills and executive control networks following mild traumatic brain injury",
    "content": "Background and objectivesMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently results in persistent cognitive deficits with limited evidence-based rehabilitation options. Visual timing deficits, potentially linked to dorsal visual pathway dysfunction, represent a promising therapeutic target. This study examined whether a novel intervention targeting dorsal visual pathways (PATH) demonstrates superior efficacy compared to conventional cognitive therapies targeting ventral pathway deficits or working memory impairments.MethodsTwenty-four participants (aged 23\u201362 years) with mTBI were randomized to receive one of three interventions over 12 weeks: (1) PATH training targeting dorsal visual pathway function, (2) Orientation Discrimination (OD) targeting ventral pathway pattern discrimination, both of these 20-min interventions followed by 10-min of digit memory exercises, or (3) ReCollect, working memory training. Each intervention consisted of 36 sessions (30 min each, three times weekly). Primary outcome was visual working memory (VWM) performance; secondary outcomes included processing speed, reading speed, auditory working memory, selective attention, and cognitive flexibility assessed via standardized neuropsychological measures. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during resting state and an N-Back task provided neurophysiological validation.ResultsPATH training yielded significantly greater VWM improvements (49%) compared to ReCollect (13%) and OD (8%) interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed superior efficacy of dorsal pathway training (significant at p = 0.011). Similar gains for PATH training were also found for processing speed, reading speed, and cognitive flexibility, especially when compared to the OD group, revealing importance of strengthening the dorsal stream before digit memory exercises. MEG analysis revealed PATH-specific activation in not only bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, superior occipital gyri, but also the left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus, primary motor cortex, and the cerebellum, as well as lower gamma-band noise, suggesting enhanced neural timing, attention, working memory, memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms beyond the targeted dorsal pathways.ConclusionDorsal visual pathway retraining followed by targeted working memory exercises demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy for cognitive rehabilitation following mTBI compared to conventional approaches. The intervention promotes beneficial neuroplasticity extending to memory-related brain regions, supporting its potential as a targeted, mechanistically-informed therapy for post-concussive cognitive deficits.",

    "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

    "title": "Ask HN: How can I get better at using AI for programming?",
    "content": "<p>I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv\">github.com/rendercv/rendercv</a></p> <p>Been a while since the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ias711/rendercv_v2_is_released_write_your_cvresume_as/\">last update</a> here. RenderCV has gotten much better, much more robust, and it's still actively maintained.</p> <h2>The idea</h2> <p>Separate your content from how it looks. Write what you've done, and let the tool handle typography.</p> <p><code>yaml cv: name: John Doe email: john@example.com sections: experience: - company: Anthropic position: ML Engineer start_date: 2023-01 highlights: - Built large language models - Deployed inference pipelines at scale </code></p> <p>Run <code>rendercv render John_Doe_CV.yaml</code>, get a pixel-perfect PDF. Consistent spacing. Aligned columns. Nothing out of place. Ever.</p> <h2>Why engineers love it</h2> <p><strong>It's text.</strong> <code>git diff</code> your CV changes. Review them in PRs. Your CV history is your commit history. Use LLMs to help write and refine your content.</p> <p><strong>Full control over every design detail.</strong> Margins, fonts, colors, spacing, alignment; all configurable in YAML.</p> <p><strong>Real-time preview.</strong> Set up <a href=\"https://docs.rendercv.com/user_guide/how_to/set_up_vs_code_for_rendercv/\">live preview in VS Code</a> and watch your PDF update as you type.</p> <p><strong>JSON Schema autocomplete.</strong> VS Code lights up with suggestions and inline docs as you type. No guessing field names. No checking documentation.</p> <p><strong>Any language.</strong> Built-in locale support, write your CV in any language.</p> <p><strong>Strict validation with Pydantic.</strong> Typo in a date? Invalid field? RenderCV tells you exactly what's wrong and where, before rendering.</p> <p><strong>5 built-in themes, all flexible.</strong> Classic, ModernCV, Sb2nov, EngineeringResumes, EngineeringClassic. Every theme exposes the same design options. Or create your own.</p> <h2>The output</h2> <p>One YAML file gives you: - PDF with perfect typography - PNG images of each page - Markdown version - HTML version</p> <h2>Installation</h2> <p>```bash pip install &quot;rendercv[full]&quot;</p> <h1>Create a new CV YAML file:</h1> <p>rendercv new &quot;Your Name&quot; </p> <h1>Render the CV YAML file:</h1> <p>rendercv render &quot;Your_Name_CV.yaml&quot; ```</p> <p>Or with Docker, uv, pipx, whatever you prefer.</p> <h2>Not a toy</h2> <ul> <li>100% test coverage</li> <li>2+ years of development</li> <li>Battle-tested by thousands of users</li> <li>Actively maintained</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong> - GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv\">https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv</a> - Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.rendercv.com\">https://docs.rendercv.com</a> - Example PDFs: <a href=\"https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/examples\">https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/tree/main/examples</a></p> <p>Happy to answer any questions.</p> <p><em>What My Project Does:</em> CV/resume generator<br /> <em>Target Audience:</em> Academics and engineers<br /> <em>Comparison:</em> JSON Resume, and YAML Resume are popular alternatives. JSON Resume isn't focused on PDF outputs. YAML Resume requires LaTeX installation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/egehancry\"> /u/egehancry </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1plhus1/rendercv_v25_write_your_cv_in_yaml_version/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1plhus1/rendercv_v25_write_your_cv_in_yaml_version/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am excited to release version <strong>2.1.1</strong> of <strong>RedLightDL</strong>. This project started as a simple Python script, but it has evolved into a comprehensive tool with a hybrid architecture.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>RedLightDL is a specialized tool for downloading videos from adult content websites. It now operates in three distinct modes to suit different needs:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The New GUI (Graphical User Interface):</strong> <ul> <li>Built using a combination of <strong>C#, JavaScript, and CSS</strong> to provide a modern, responsive experience.</li> <li>Allows users to queue downloads, select quality (1080p, 720p, etc.), and manage settings visually without touching a terminal.</li> <li>Features a clean dashboard for monitoring active downloads.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>The CLI (Command Line Interface):</strong> <ul> <li>For users who prefer the terminal or want to run the tool on headless servers.</li> <li>Powered by <code>click</code> and <code>rich</code>, offering progress bars, colored logs, and robust argument parsing.</li> <li>Supports resume capability, auto-retry on connection drop, and config files.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>The API (Python Library):</strong> <ul> <li>The core logic is modular. You can import RedLightDL into your own Python scripts.</li> <li>It provides classes for scraping, extraction, and downloading, allowing developers to build their own tools on top of this engine.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>End Users:</strong> The new GUI makes it accessible for anyone who wants a &quot;one-click&quot; download experience.</li> <li><strong>Power Users:</strong> The CLI is perfect for batch scripting and server-side archiving (<code>r/DataHoarder</code> style).</li> <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Those interested in <strong>Hybrid App Development</strong>. This project demonstrates how to connect a Python backend (handling the heavy lifting/scraping) with a polished frontend built with C# and Web Technologies (JS/CSS).</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most downloaders are either purely CLI (hard for beginners) or bloated web apps. RedLightDL bridges the gap by offering a <strong>native desktop feel</strong> with the power of a Python scraper. Unlike generic tools like <code>yt-dlp</code>, it is specifically optimized for the supported adult platforms, handling their specific captchas or dynamic layouts more aggressively.</p> <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Core Logic:</strong> Python (<code>requests</code>, <code>bs4</code>, <code>rich</code>)</li> <li><strong>UI Layer:</strong> C#, JavaScript, CSS</li> <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Available via PyPI (CLI) and GitHub Releases (GUI Executable).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Installation:</strong> For the CLI/API version:</p> <p>Bash</p> <pre><code>pip install ph-shorts </code></pre> <p>For the new <strong>GUI version</strong>, check the GitHub Releases.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL/releases/download/v2.1.1/RedLightSetup.exe\"><strong>GUI File Download Link</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Source Code &amp; Release:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL\">https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL</a></p> <p>100% Made By Ai</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/diastom\"> /u/diastom </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqga1/project_redlightdl_v21video_downloader_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqga1/project_redlightdl_v21video_downloader_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Maan: A Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform Built with Python",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I've been working on a side project called <strong>Maan</strong> (which means &quot;together&quot; in Arabic - \u0645\u0639\u0627\u064b). It's a live coding space where multiple users can collaborate on code, similar to how VS Code Live Share operates, but I built it from scratch using Python.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> Maan lets you code together in real-time with other developers. You can edit files simultaneously, see each other's cursors, chat while you work, and clone GitHub repos directly into a shared workspace. Think of it like Google Docs but for code editing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Right now, it's more of a proof-of-concept than a production-ready tool. I built it primarily for:</p> <ul> <li>Small teams (2-5 people) who want to pair program remotely</li> <li>Mentors helping students with coding problems</li> <li>Quick code reviews where you can edit together</li> <li>Casual coding sessions with friends</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> Most existing collaborative coding tools either:</p> <ol> <li><strong>VS Code Live Share</strong> - Requires VS Code installation and Microsoft accounts</li> <li><strong>Replit/Glitch</strong> - Great for web projects but limited to their ecosystem</li> <li><strong>CodeTogether</strong> - Enterprise-focused with complex setups</li> </ol> <p>Maan differs by being:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Just a browser tab, no heavy IDE installation</li> <li><strong>Python-native</strong> - Entire backend is Python/Flask based</li> <li><strong>Self-hostable</strong> - Run it on your own server</li> <li><strong>Simpler</strong> - Focuses on core collaboration without tons of features</li> </ul> <p>It originated from a weekend hackathon, so it's not flawless. There are definitely areas that need improvement, some features still need refinement, and the code could use a tidy-up. But the core concept is functional: you can actually code alongside others in real time with minimal setup.</p> <p>Here's what's currently working:</p> <ul> <li>You can see others typing and moving their cursors in real-time.</li> <li>It's powered by Flask with Socket.IO to keep everything synchronized.</li> <li>I've implemented Monaco Editor (the same one used in VS Code).</li> <li>There's a file browser, chat functionality, and the ability to pull in repositories from GitHub.</li> <li>Session hosts have control over who joins and what permissions they have.</li> <li>You can participate as a guest or log in.</li> <li>It seems stable with up to 5 users in a room.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why did I take on this project?</strong> To be honest, I just wanted to experiment and see if I could create a straightforward &quot;live coding together&quot; experience without a complicated setup. Turns out, Python makes it quite manageable! I'm using it for:</p> <ul> <li>Solving coding issues with friends</li> <li>Guiding someone through bug fixes</li> <li>Quick remote collaborations with my team</li> <li>Casual coding sessions</li> </ul> <p>For those interested in the tech side:</p> <ul> <li>Backend: Flask, Socket.IO, SQLAlchemy (keeping it simple with SQLite)</li> <li>Frontend: Monaco Editor with vanilla JavaScript</li> <li>Integrated GitPython for cloning repos, colorful cursors to identify users, and a basic admin panel</li> </ul> <p>Interested in checking it out? \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/elmoiv/maan\">https://github.com/elmoiv/maan</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback\u2014does the real-time experience feel smooth? Is the setup intuitive? What features would make you inclined to use something like this? And if you're curious about how everything fits together, just ask!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elmoiv\"> /u/elmoiv </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqfm1/maan_a_realtime_collaborative_coding_platform/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqfm1/maan_a_realtime_collaborative_coding_platform/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Optimal feedback solutions recapitulate key features of motorcortical population dynamics",
    "content": "Neural populations display complex response patterns with marked transitions between distinct underlying computational strategies on very short timescales during motor tasks. Such complex-yet-structured dynamical strategies may reflect computational needs of neural systems, shaped by optimal feedback and autonomous mechanisms, in addition to biological constraints. Are there overarching computational principles that govern complex dynamical strategies exhibited by the neural population response? Here, we explore the hypothesis that computational strategies underlying neural population response represent optimal feedback solutions to the control of musculoskeletal dynamics through space for a goal. To validate this hypothesis, we develop a procedure called neural optimization using dynamical systems (NODS) learning to modify synaptic strengths within a recurrent network for locally-optimal feedback control of anatomically accurate musculoskeletal models during complex sensorimotor tasks. NODS learning works even when the objective function to be minimized is highly non-linear or the muscle model is very complex. The dynamical strategies underlying the neural network response constructed using NODS learning recapitulate key features of recorded population response. Importantly, optimal feedback solutions using NODS learning suggest that feedback mechanisms are essential for neural populations to flexibly transit between complex-yet-structured strategies. We further show that this framework provides theoretical foundations for why the solutions obtained using deep reinforcement learning algorithms extensively used to model sensorimotor tasks may explain the dynamical strategies underlying recorded population response. In summary, we develop novel methods and approaches suggesting that neural dynamics may be more strongly modulated by optimal feedback mechanisms, in addition to autonomous mechanisms, than previously appreciated.",

    "title": "Distinct Temporal Patterns of Human Neural Firing in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Speech and Orofacial Movement",
    "content": "Clinical studies, along with electrophysiological findings, provide evidence that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) contributes to speech production. These studies have reported that the STN encodes diverse aspects of speech, comprising speech motor planning and execution, timing, and linguistic features such as phonetic content. However, none of these studies have included an orofacial non-speech motor task to evaluate speech-specificity of STN activity. Here, we examined the modulation of STN neurons while participants engaged in two speech tasks (sentence repetition and syllable repetition) as well as two non-speech orofacial movement tasks (jaw movement and tongue protrusion) in awake patients with Parkinsons disease undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery. A total of 51 single- and multi-unit neural clusters were captured. A Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) was implemented to understand the temporal dynamics of STN activity. A larger proportion of clusters was modulated during speech (22%) than during orofacial movement (12%) and a substantial subset of STN neural clusters responded to overlapping speech and orofacial tasks (27%). The findings suggest that STN can encode both motor and linguistic aspects of speech production.",

    "title": "P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels regulate calcium signaling and developmental myelination in oligodendrocyte lineage cells",
    "content": "Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) are glia that arise as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) and may persist as progenitors or differentiate into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLCs are sensitive to neuronal activity, which can influence myelin formation via activity-dependent myelination. Calcium influx in OLCs regulates many developmental processes, including stabilizing newly formed sheaths. OLCs possess P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) that contribute to calcium influx and mutations in these channels are implicated in a spectrum of neurological disorders, yet the functional significance of P/Q-type channels in OLCs is not well understood. In this study, we employ zebrafish to investigate the role of P/Q-type channels in OLCs in vivo during development. We use global and cell-type specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing approaches in conjunction with live imaging and physiology to characterize the morphology and signaling properties of OLCs with mutated P/Q-type channel genes. P/Q-type channels are required for normal myelination in the developing CNS and mutants present with decreased amplitude sheath calcium transients, reduced myelin production, shorter myelin sheaths and blebbing membrane structures during development. These findings provide new insight into the role of P/Q-type calcium channels in regulating OLC development and myelination.",

    "title": "Presynaptic GABAB autoreceptors suppress neurotransmitter release during repetitive stimulation via the G\u03b2\u03b3-SNARE pathway.",
    "content": "GABAergic signaling provides the primary inhibitory mechanism of the brain, with defects linked to epilepsy, anxiety, depression, insomnia, schizophrenia and neurodegeneration. A key regulatory mechanism is autoinhibition of GABA release during repetitive activity via presynaptic Gi/o-coupled GABAB receptors, supporting synaptic tuning and memory formation, and limiting neurotransmitter spillover. Exogenous GABAB receptor agonists reduce presynaptic Ca2+ entry by inhibiting calcium channels. However, using transgenic mice expressing a mutant SNAP25 with diminished ability to bind G{beta}{gamma} (SNAP25{delta}3), we show that suppression by GABAB autoreceptors requires intact G{beta}{gamma}-SNARE interactions. Imaging of presynaptic Ca2+ transients in GABAergic axons showed no GABA-mediated autoreceptor suppression of Ca2+ entry during stimulus trains. In contrast, application of the exogenous GABAB receptor agonist baclofen profoundly inhibited Ca2+ entry, which could be partially reversed by exogenously elevating cAMP, indicating a complementary role of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Baclofen reduced spontaneous IPSC frequency and amplitude and both effects were diminished in SNAP25{delta}3 mice, consistent with inhibition at Ca2+ channels and SNARE complexes. Physiological GABA-mediated and exogenous GABAB receptor activation thus produce distinct outcomes on GABAergic neurotransmission, indicating that synthetic drug application to neurons does not faithfully recapitulate endogenous signaling pathways. We conclude that endogenous rapid GABAB autoreceptor signaling inhibits neurotransmitter release primarily by G{beta}{gamma}-mediated inhibitions of SNARE mechanisms, whereas prolonged agonist application additionally suppresses Ca2+ influx via cAMP signaling.",

    "title": "A Unified Mechanism for Depth Perception and Figure-Ground Organization",
    "content": "Understanding how the visual system unifies depth perception and figure ground organization remains a central challenge in vision science. Stereoscopic disparity and border ownership have long been treated as distinct processes, yet both arise with similar timing in area V2 and exhibit strikingly parallel properties. Here we propose a unified mechanism that integrates both within a single hierarchical framework. Building upon the layered disparity representation introduced in our prior work, we show that border ownership, serving as the key component of figure ground organization, emerges intrinsically from thresholded relative disparity differencing, providing a unified basis for contour-based segmentation and depth perception. Using biologically constrained network models (TcNet), we demonstrate that this mechanism generalizes across binocular and illusory depth domains, bridging physical and nonepipolar disparity cues. At the systems level, we identify complementary dual feedback pathways from area V4: V4->V1, which refines and re-weights layered disparity maps, and V4->V2, which integrates global contextual priors such as shape continuity and category consistency. Together, these recurrent loops balance fine-scale depth precision with large-scale figure ground coherence, offering a unified explanation for perceptual alternations such as the Rubin Face Vase and Kanizsa illusions. This framework integrates intrinsic disparity computation, border-ownership dynamics, and hierarchical feedback modulation into a coherent, biologically plausible model. It provides a mechanistic account of how early visual areas interact with higher cortical feedback to achieve stable yet flexible perception of depth and figure ground organization within a unified temporal cycle.",

    "title": "Dorsolateral striatal acetylcholine reorganizes neural ensembles to anticipate threat",
    "content": "Adaptive behavior requires flexible encoding of emotional valence. Although striatal acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is critical for reinforcement learning, its contribution to aversive learning has remained poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that ACh release in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is selectively biased toward negative valence. Using fiber photometry with a genetically encoded ACh sensor, we found that ACh release robustly increased during threat prediction but decreased in anticipation of rewarding outcomes, revealing a bidirectional and valence-specific signature. Optogenetically stimulating ACh release at cue onset accelerated threat learning, impaired extinction, and shifted behavioral responding toward persistent threat expectancy. Concurrent single-cell calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation revealed that elevated ACh release dynamically reorganized DLS ensemble activity, increasing both excited and inhibited neurons and producing large-scale state-space divergence during threat cues. During extinction, optogenetically sustained ACh release preserved the organization of threat-predictive DLS ensemble activity despite the absence of shock. These findings identify DLS ACh as a valence-specific neuromodulatory signal that reconfigures striatal network dynamics, primes ensembles for impending threat, and biases learning toward threat persistence.",

    "content": "Recent studies have revealed many alternative exons differentially spliced across diverse neuron types in the mammalian brain, but their links to neuronal physiology remain unclear. Here we characterize a deeply conserved microexon E35a in Ank3 encoding ankyrin-G (AnkG), a multifaceted adaptor protein best known as a master organizer of the axon initial segment (AIS) and as a leading genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder. E35a is predominantly skipped in cortical glutamatergic neurons but included in cortical GABAergic neurons and cerebellar neurons, which is dictated by multiple neuronal splicing factors. In E35a-deletion mice we generated, interneurons show increased excitability and somatic Ca2+ activity, without disruption in AIS. Biochemical analyses suggest that E35a inclusion facilitates AnkG interaction with a protein complex involving inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) important for intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Alternative splicing therefore allows AnkG to modulate neuron type-specific excitability in addition to its ubiquitous pan-neuronal role in organizing the AIS.",

    "title": "Varied monoamine reuptake inhibitors reduce parvalbumin expression; implications for pyramidal cell disinhibition and enhanced neuroplasticity",
    "content": "First-line antidepressants are effective in a significant percent of individuals but a full understanding of how these therapeutics target specific endpoints is lacking. Prior work has shown that depression is associated with hippocampal atrophy and that antidepressants can increase neurotrophin levels to increase hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal pyramidal cell (PC) spine density and arbor. These effects likely contribute to amelioration of symptoms. A less well-explored possibility is that antidepressants concomitantly disinhibit hippocampal PC activity, which could also facilitate increased PC arbor, spinogenesis and/or activity. In accordance, previous studies have shown antidepressants can attenuate stress-induced upregulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are predominantly localized to parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons and increase PV expression and neuronal activity. Though specific antidepressants have been explored for effects on regional PNN expression, the question of whether hippocampal PNN/ECM remodeling is a shared feature of varied antidepressant drugs and more importantly, of whether it is associated with significant hippocampal PV inhibition, has not been well-addressed. Herein we examine three monoamine reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, venlafaxine and viloxazine, in animal models for effects on PNN remodeling and PV expression, a proxy for PV activity. We observe shared effects of these therapeutics including the ability to increase PNN degrading effectors that can downregulate PV activity. Consistent with this, we observe shared effects of these drugs in terms of their ability to significantly reduce PV levels. These findings highlight the possibility that ECM remodeling and associated hippocampal PC disinhibition represent a shared feature of varied antidepressant medications.",

    "title": "Human cortical networks trade communication efficiency for computational reliability.",
    "content": "Brains are often described as cost-efficient communication networks, optimally balancing the cost of long connections with the benefits of fast communication. Here, inspired by the \"use it or lose it\" principle, we present a novel game-theoretic model of self-organizing neural units and show that the brain is, in fact, sub-optimal in both regards: First, we demonstrate that regional competition for connectivity under propagative communication dynamics naturally gives rise to network configurations similar to those derived from the human cortex while being even more efficient and economical. Next, we use a reservoir computing framework to compare the information processing capacity of these networks against those of the brain. Although comparable in performance, the more optimal trade-off comes with a tax on computational reliability. Through synthetic lesions, we show that these networks are fragile because, to optimize for communication, they funnel information through a spatially clustered \"oligarchy\" comprising a tight set of transmodal hubs. In contrast, the human brain uses a more distributed \"rich club\" backbone that better resists breakdown following targeted attacks, even when it means higher wiring costs and less efficient communication. This reveals a previously overlooked principle: cortical networks trade both cost and efficiency for reliable computation. Thus, our findings highlight computational reliability as another, and even more prominent driver of brain connectivity compared to wiring cost and communication efficiency.",

    "title": "Neural replay is connected to latent cause inference and supports fast generalization",
    "content": "Generalizing from previous experience in value-based tasks requires discovering and exploiting hidden structure to draw inferences beyond direct observations, and thereby update information about the values of states. We combined behavior, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling to test how latent cause inference guides neural replay, enabling fast generalization. Over two days, fifty-two participants performed a sequential decision task in which multiple visual sequences either shared a latent reward source or were associated with an independent reward. On day 1, participants learned this correlation structure and exploited it to achieve 1-shot value generalization after reversals. Multivariate decoding and sequentiality analyses revealed backward replay in visual cortex during rest intervals that was selective to unobserved reward-linked sequences, consistent with non-local value updating. In parallel, the representation of the abstract reward structure in medial temporal lobe (MTL) increased from early to late blocks on day 1. On day 2, we covertly changed which sequences shared rewards. Participants flexibly reorganized generalization, and replay patterns adapted, parallel to a reorganization of MTL representations. A LCI model captured the initial learning trajectory and adaptation upon changes in latent structure. The model captured individual differences in structure learning, and its value updating of unobserved states predicted trial-wise fluctuations in replay strength. These results provide a mechanistic account in which latent structure discovery and replay interact to propagate value and enable rapid, flexible generalization.",

    "title": "The expression level of CACNA1C-encoded CaV1.2 is a tipping point between promotion and inhibition of dendritic growth in neurons",
    "content": "The CACNA1C gene encodes the CaV1.2 L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, which plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling. CACNA1C is a risk gene for psychiatric conditions involving disruption of neuronal connectivity such as schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorders. While genomic studies are consistently reinforcing the notion of CACNA1C as an important locus related to these diseases, the role of CaV1.2 channels in determining neuronal architecture is incompletely understood. Several studies pinpoint the L-type current (ICaL) as regulator of dendritic arborization development. ICaL lays upstream of competing cellular mechanisms leading to both inhibition and promotion of dendritic growth. How signal selectivity is achieved remains an open question. Here, we report that ICaL -dependent dendritic development of murine cultured hippocampal neurons relies on CaV1.2 and is determined by an equilibrium between the level of CaV1.2 protein expression and ICaL activity. Indeed, increasing ICaL enhances dendritic complexity only when CaV1.2 expression level is reduced. In contrast, when channel levels are at baseline, the CaV1.2-dependent growing signal is overcome by the elevation of the dendritic growth inhibiting CaMKII signaling beyond basal conditions. These findings suggest that CaV1.2 expression level acts as a molecular switch between dendritic growing and inhibiting signals. Consequently, altered CaV1.2 expression during early development may alter neuronal structure, potentially impairing neural network formation and increasing susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Development of anterior hippocampal integration underlies the protracted emergence of cognitive map formation and generalization",
    "content": "Flexible memory depends on integrating experiences across time and space into cognitive maps[&mdash;]holistic representations that support flexible navigation and generalization. Although the anterior hippocampus is thought to support integration across broad spatiotemporal scales, it matures relatively late, suggesting that its functional development may be key to mature cognitive mapping. Here, we show that anterior hippocampal integration, indexed by temporal autocorrelation of fMRI activation, undergoes prolonged development and predicts age-related improvements in spatial memory. In a large resting-state sample (N=382; aged 5-34 years), temporal autocorrelation increased with age in anterior but not posterior hippocampus. We replicated this anterior pattern in an independent, task-based sample (N=85; aged 6-12 years and adults). Moreover, we linked hippocampal integration to behavior using a spatial navigation task that required participants to adapt to rotations of a virtual environment across learning runs as well as generalize learned cognitive maps when new objects were introduced. Children exhibited lower anterior autocorrelation and re-learned object positions when the environment changed. In adolescents, increasing anterior hippocampal autocorrelation was accompanied by gradual behavioral improvements in locating objects in the face of environmental change. Adults showed the greatest anterior hippocampal autocorrelation, which uniquely supported accurate spatial memory performance through efficient path navigation in the changing environment. These findings identify spatiotemporal integration in anterior hippocampus as a key mechanism underlying the developmental shift from local representation of individual positions in an environment to formation of flexible cognitive maps that are robust and generalizable in the face of environmental change.",

    "title": "Differences in the co-distribution of the Cannabinoid Receptor-1, FAAH, and MAGL in the human and mouse brain could be limiting clinical translation of endocannabinoid outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease.",
    "content": "Endocannabinoid system (ECS) outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD) do not always align with the clinical disease course. We compared the distribution of the Cannabinoid Receptor-1 (CB1R) and the enzymes, FAAH and MAGL, in autopsy AD brain samples as well as in the J20 (hAPPSwe/Ind) mouse model of AD. Both sources revealed several anti-CB1R immunoreactive species, e.g. one at 47-kDa (corresponding to the protein-coding sequence) and a reported putative splice variant at 37 kDa. We did not observe any changes in the mean expression in CB1R, FAAH or MAGL in the human samples, but did observe sex- and genotype-specific changes in the mouse brain. Regression analysis revealed strong sex- and APOE epsilon4-dependent associations among the CB1Rs as well as between CB1Rs and MAGL (but not FAAH) in human cortical (but not hippocampal) samples. In the J20 mouse, associations between CB1Rs were limited to hippocampal samples, whereas associations between CB1R and both MAGL and FAAH were observed in the cortex. A diagnosis of AD disrupted any associations in the human dataset, whereas in several instances, the associations were enhanced by the hAPPSwe/Ind transgene. This inferred species-dependent regulation of the ECS could impact the clinical translational of ECS outcomes in preclinical models of AD pathology.",

    "title": "An Amygdalar Oscillatory Switch Governs Valence Assignment",
    "content": "Reward pursuit and punishment avoidance are among the most fundamental behaviors necessary for survival. The binary valuation of an experience as either positive or negative - valence assignment - is imperative for successful navigation of a regularly updating environment. Mounting evidence highlights the critical role of valence responsive basolateral amygdala (BLA) ensembles in coding valence information. However, how BLA ensembles are recruited to drive real-time valence assignment remains elusive. Here, we show locus coeruleus (LC)-derived norepinephrine coordinates this neural computational process via modulatory control over network-organizing BLA parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron activity. Specifically, optogenetic activation of LC to BLA noradrenergic terminals (LC-BLANE) drives real-time negative valence assignment and suppression of BLA fast gamma oscillatory activity via BLA interneuronal alpha1a adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, positive valence assignment also requires BLA PV interneuron activity but is associated with an enhancement of local fast gamma power. Together, these converging data highlight a PV-driven amygdalar oscillatory switch that governs valence assignment.",

    "title": "Noradrenergic neuromodulation of cholecystokinin interneurons in the basolateral amygdala alters rhythmic activity and restrains fear memory",
    "content": "Norepinephrine (NE) release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during emotional arousal plays an essential role in the processing of fear. However, the cell type-specific NE neuromodulation of the fear circuit in the BLA has not been fully resolved. We reported previously a facilitation of fear memory by Gq-coupled receptor induction of repetitive bursting in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and suppression of gamma oscillations in the BLA. Here, using patch clamp recordings, Cre-dependent DLX-driven intersectional targeting, and genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that NE also activates cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons to generate synchronized trains of rhythmic CB1-sensitive IPSCs in BLA principal neurons via Gq-coupled 1A adrenoreceptor activation. The Gq-dependent mechanism in CCK interneurons is generalizable to chemogenetic Gq manipulation and Gq-coupled 5-HT2C serotoninergic receptor activation. We next tested the role of Gq neuromodulation of CCK interneurons in the regulation of BLA network activity associated with the behavioral expression of fear learning by rescued expression of 1A adrenoreceptors or chemogenetic Gq activation selectively in BLA CCK interneurons in a global 1A adrenoreceptor knockout mouse. Restoration of the rhythmic inhibitory synaptic activity via rescue of Gq-coupled receptor signaling in CCK interneurons enhanced LFP theta power in the BLA in vivo and decreased fear memory acquisition and recall. These data indicate an inhibitory role for CCK interneuron Gq signaling in fear learning via activation of patterned inhibitory synaptic input to principal neurons and enhanced theta oscillations in the BLA, and reveal a G protein-dependent, receptor-nonselective neuromodulatory mechanism in the BLA that regulates network and behavioral states.",

Using cell type-specific approaches, we characterized two circuit nodes that are differentially configured by hormones to modulate infant-evoked behavior. An excitatory neuronal population in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus is only active in lactating mothers, increases virgin female caregiving when artificially stimulated and confers oxytocin sensitivity in mothers through a prolactin STAT5b pathway. These neurons function upstream of another preoptic area population involved in male and female parenting, thus boosting caregiving by mothers. By contrast, androgen signaling in the latter preoptic population reshapes their intrinsic properties to promote pup-directed aggression, revealing cell type-specific tuning of social behavior circuits.",

    "title": "Cross-species evidence for the refinement of intrinsic neural timescales supporting executive system maturation through adolescence",
    "content": "Brain functional, structural, and neurochemical maturation has been found to support the specialization of executive systems through adolescence that will lead to adult level processing. Importantly, animal models and initial EEG studies in humans indicate developmental improvements in neural processing of complex information that would be evident in changes in temporal dynamics, which are not well-understood. Intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), or the temporal windows over which neural populations integrate inputs, have been proposed to reflect circuit-level properties such as excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, myelination, and functional properties supporting complex information processing such as in executive functioning. Here, we used a multimodal, cross-species approach to investigate how INTs develop across adolescence to support cognitive specialization. In parallel analyses using a large longitudinal human EEG cohort, adolescent intracranial sEEG recordings, and macaque local field potentials, we observed robust reductions in INTs through adolescence, particularly in frontal and parietal association cortices. These developmental reductions were shaped by local circuit physiology, as evidenced by associations between shorter INTs and both lower aperiodic exponents, indicative of increased E/I balance, and reduced spectral offsets, suggesting lower aggregate spiking. We also found structural contributions via developmental interactions between age and deep layer intracortical myelination which predicted shorter INTs, suggesting that long-range circuitry may play a key role in shaping spontaneous temporal dynamics. Functionally, shorter INTs in adolescence were linked to improved working memory accuracy and reduced response time variability, indicating a behavioral advantage of refined temporal integration windows through development. Together, these findings establish INTs as a conserved, biologically grounded signature of adolescent brain maturation, providing a mechanistic framework for how structural and physiological refinements reorganize temporal processing to support increasingly efficient cognitive function.",

    "title": "Loss of noradrenergic Fkbp5 disrupts social behavior and norepinephrine dynamics in the basolateral amygdala",
    "content": "Social dysfunction is common in depression and varies with stress exposure and genetic risk. The current study identifies a cell-type specific role for Fkbp5, a glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone, in noradrenergic neurons engaged during social stress. Acute social stress upregulated Fkbp5 in the locus coeruleus (LC), whereas repeated exposure attenuated this effect. Noradrenergic Fkbp5 deletion (Fkbp5Nat) increased pro-social behavior exclusively in male mice. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), social interaction reduced norepinephrine (NE) turnover in wild-type but not Fkbp5Nat mice. Consistently, proteomics revealed mitochondrial/energy and synapse-related remodeling in BLA neurons. Miniscope imaging showed that behavior-locked NE transients in BLA were selectively blunted in Fkbp5Nat mice during interaction with outbred CD1 conspecifics, while same-strain C57BL/6N encounters preserved NE dynamics. Together, this study indicates that Fkbp5 tunes LC-BLA output to social salience in a sex- and context-dependent manner, suggesting a circuit-specific route to normalize social salience without broadly suppressing noradrenergic function.",

    "title": "A Causal Role for the Hippocampus in Gating Rapid Motor Memory Consolidation",
    "content": "How humans learn new skills is a fundamental aspect of behavior. Rapid memory consolidation during brief rests is crucial, but the causal role of the hippocampus remains unclear. Here, we used personalized transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to non-invasively modulate the hippocampus. We found that hippocampal neuromodulation fundamentally alters how a skill is learned. Compared to sham stimulation, TUS shifted performance gains from rest periods (offline consolidation) to active practice (online learning). Paradoxically, this manipulation not only reshaped the learning process but also boosted overall performance by unmasking a latent and highly efficient online learning pathway, leading to superior skill retention 24 hours later. These findings provide causal evidence that the hippocampus acts as a gating mechanism, governing a key trade-off between online and offline learning pathways. Our work demonstrates that non-invasive deep brain modulation can causally alter the balance between competing memory systems, opening new avenues to optimize human performance.",

    "title": "Orientation-tuned surround suppression exhibits a unique laminar signature in human primary visual cortex",
    "content": "Spatial context modifies visual perception by enhancing novel and salient features over spatially redundant features in the underlying neural code of primary visual cortex (V1). Although multiple intracortical pathways contribute to contextual modulation, their specific contributions to different types of contextual modulation are not fully understood. Leveraging the distinct laminar connectivity patterns of feedforward, feedback, and lateral pathways, we used ultra-high-resolution fMRI (7T T$_2$*-weighted, 0.6 mm isotropic resolution) to infer their relative contributions to contextual modulation in V1 by analyzing blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across cortical depth. Participants viewed sine-wave grating disks embedded in large surround gratings. Segmentation cues were introduced or removed by manipulating the relative phase and orientation of the surround gratings, yielding three contextual conditions and a surround-only condition to measure the effects of context in the absence of feedforward input. Our analysis isolated the effects of orientation-tuned surround suppression (OTSS) from orientation-independent border-induced modulation (BIM). The results show that BOLD laminar profiles differ by modulation type: BIM affected both deep and superficial voxels, while OTSS was absent in deep voxels. We also find that voxels at all depths are driven by spatial context in the absence of feedforward input, which accords with the discovery of contextually-driven neural responses in mammalian V1. These laminar differences likely reflect distinct contributions of feedback from higher-order visual areas and long-range lateral connections within V1. Our findings help to explicate the contributions of recurrent processing in visual contextual modulation and demonstrate the participation of lateral pathways in laminar-dependent BOLD fMRI.",

    "title": "Orbitofrontal noradrenaline mediates volatility-dependent adjustment of learning rate",
    "content": "Adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments requires flexible adjustment of learning speed to balance stability and flexibility. When outcomes are highly stochastic, learners must avoid over interpreting noise and update more slowly, whereas in volatile environments where contingencies change frequently, learning should accelerate to rapidly incorporate new evidence. Theories propose that internal estimates of uncertainty tune learning rates through neuromodulatory-dependent mechanisms. Here, we investigated how noradrenergic inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) support adaptive learning under uncertainty. We show that rats performing a probabilistic reversal learning task exhibited behavior that was best explained by an adaptive reinforcement-learning model in which learning rates dynamically adjust according to estimated environmental volatility and stochasticity, outperforming standard fixed-rate models. Noradrenaline release in the OFC closely tracked trial-by-trial, model-derived volatility estimates around contingency changes. Disrupting LC[-&gt;]OFC noradrenergic inputs reproduced the model-predicted deficit in volatility-dependent adjustments of learning rate. Together, these findings identify OFC noradrenergic signaling as a key circuit mechanism for volatility-dependent modulation of learning rates during adaptive decision-making.",

    "title": "The Connectome Modulates Critical Brain Dynamics Across Local and Global Scales",
    "content": "Neuronal activity in the brain has been hypothesized to operate near criticality--a dynamical regime poised between order and disorder that maximizes information processing, adaptability, and dynamic range. While criticality has been extensively studied at local scales (within neuronal populations) and at global scales (across interacting brain regions), the interplay between these levels remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a multiscale computational framework that bridges local and global criticality within a single, mechanistic model. At the mesoscopic level, individual brain regions are represented by neural mass models tuned near the transition between asynchronous and synchronous regimes. These regions are then coupled via an empirically derived mouse connectome to investigate how structural connectivity shapes the emergence of large-scale coordination. We show that (i) local near critical dynamics for an isolated brain region can be faithfully reproduced within a mean-field model framework, (ii) local distance to criticality is modulated by long-range coupling, (iii) whole-brain simulations reveal non-linear gradients of timescales and heterogeneous shifts towards/away from local criticality, and (iv) global criticality, manifested in scale-free avalanche distributions and optimal functional connectivity, emerges when local populations are locally tuned near criticality and coupled within an optimal range. These results demonstrate that local and global criticality are dynamically intertwined but not directly aligned, and that their relationship depends on the underlying structural connectivity. Our multiscale modeling framework provides a tractable tool for generating testable hypotheses on how brain criticality co-arises across scales and how it may be modulated in health and disease.",

    "title": "Altered Motor Gamma Activity and Hemispheric Lateralisation Reflect Perinatal Maturity in Preterm Children during Motor Control",
    "content": "Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is associated with alterations in brain development and an increased likelihood of motor difficulties, with effects that often persist across childhood. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex is closely linked to motor execution and reflects the dynamic properties of cortical function, yet motor-related oscillations have rarely been examined directly in children born preterm. In this study, we investigated motor-induced gamma oscillations in school-aged children born preterm using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eighteen children born preterm and nineteen age- and IQ-matched children born at full term (5 to 7 years old) completed a child-friendly dominant-hand finger movement task during recording with a child-customised MEG system. The preterm group exhibited significantly slower response times and approximately twenty-two per cent weaker contralateral gamma power compared with their full-term peers. They also showed reduced hemispheric lateralisation, indicating greater bilateral cortical engagement. Motor-related gamma power and lateralisation indices were positively associated with perinatal factors and motor performance scores. These findings suggest that attenuated gamma activity and altered lateralisation patterns in children born preterm may relate to delayed maturation of motor cortical circuits and variations in callosal development, potentially affecting interhemispheric communication and motor processing efficiency. This study provides new insight into the neurophysiological basis of motor development following preterm birth.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "title": "Peripheral CB1R inhibition modulates food intake and metabolic efficiency in obesity independently of the gut-brain vagal axis",
    "content": "Obesity arises from profound disruptions in neuroendocrine communication and impaired central regulation of energy homeostasis. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), through cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs), is a key modulator of feeding, metabolism, and gut-brain signaling. While global CB1R blockade improves metabolic control, its clinical translation has been limited by adverse neuropsychiatric effects, underscoring the therapeutic potential of peripherally restricted CB1R inhibition whose neural mechanisms remain insufficiently defined. Here, we show that two peripheral CB1R antagonists, the inverse agonist JD-5037 and the neutral antagonist AM6545, selectively suppress food intake and shift nutrient partitioning toward fat oxidation in obese, but not lean, mice, without altering total energy expenditure. We further demonstrate that high-fat exposure markedly upregulates CB1R expression in the nodose ganglia, suggesting an enhanced reliance on periphery-to-brain ECS signaling in obesity. Using cFos mapping, we reveal that inhibition of peripheral CB1Rs robustly recruits satiety-related brainstem and hypothalamic structures. Interestingly, disruption of the gut-brain vagal axis abolishes JD-5037-induced activation of brainstem nuclei but leaves hypothalamic activation, and the anorexigenic response, fully intact. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of key vagal endocrine mediators, cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), fails to blunt the feeding-suppressive effects of peripheral CB1R blockade. These findings uncover an unprecedent dual mechanism whereby vagal pathways mediate brainstem engagement, whereas hypothalamic recruitment and metabolic benefits arise through vagal-independent signaling. Our results position peripheral CB1R inhibition as a mechanistically distinct approach capable of engaging central homeostatic circuits without direct brain penetration, supporting peripherally acting CB1R antagonists as promising therapeutics for obesity and metabolic disorders.",

    "title": "Boosting the signal: Expectation-driven gain modulation of preparatory spatial attention",
    "content": "The visual system can flexibly adjust attentional deployment to match task demands, but whether observers can proactively modulate the spatial scope of attention based on expectations about upcoming search difficulty remains unclear. According to the zoom lens model, attention can narrow or broaden its spatial extent, with narrower focus enhancing processing efficiency, a mechanism that would benefit target discrimination in crowded displays. We tested whether observers adjust attentional scope when expecting sparse versus dense search arrays by combining spatial cueing with block-wise manipulations of display density expectations. Participants performed a visual search task in which endogenous cues predicted target location, while blocks predominantly contained either sparse (1 target, 3 distractors) or dense (1 target, 7 distractors) displays. We applied inverted encoding models to EEG data to reconstruct spatial channel tuning functions, enabling precise characterization of both the locus and breadth of attentional deployment. Behaviorally, expecting difficult searches selectively improved accuracy at cued locations without costs elsewhere. Consistent with this selective benefit, neural measurements revealed that expectancy enhanced the amplitude of spatially selective responses at the attended location but did not alter tuning width. These findings demonstrate that expectations about search difficulty modulate attention through gain-based signal enhancement rather than adjustments to spatial scope, revealing that preparatory attentional control operates via amplitude modulation within a stable spatial focus. This mechanism complements reactive attentional adjustments and provides an efficient means for the visual system to optimize processing under predictable task demands.",

    "content": "Noxious mechanical stimuli give rise to distinct percepts, from sharp cutaneous pain to diffuse visceral discomfort, yet the nociceptor ensembles that underlie these differences remain poorly defined. We mapped the peripheral architecture of nociceptive signaling by combining in vivo activity labeling of pelvic nerve afferents with single-cell RNA sequencing. Noxious stimuli recruited diverse classes of mechano-nociceptors, but stimulus type exerted modest influence on the composition of activated ensembles. Instead, tissue identity imposed the dominant organizational structure: stimulation of cutaneous and deep pelvic tissues engaged distinct subsets of both myelinated and unmyelinated neurons, revealing a clear domain-level division. Within this architecture, we identified a bladder-innervating myelinated nociceptor subtype with distinctive molecular features, illustrating an additional layer of refinement. Functional imaging and anatomical tracing corroborated this multilevel organization. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization of peripheral mechanical pain encoding, in which mechano-nociceptor populations are differentially engaged according to tissue domain and organ context.",

    "content": "Food addiction is a multifactorial disorder characterized by a loss of control over food intake, contributing to the development of obesity. To investigate the involvement of the prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the transition to food addiction, we examined PL calcium dynamics in mice exhibiting addicted versus non-addicted behavioral phenotypes. Our behavioral results allowed the identification of two distinct subpopulations of addicted and non-addicted mice, enabling direct comparison of their neural activity profiles. Addicted and non-addicted mice showed significant differences across several PL calcium activity parameters. These findings demonstrate a strong association between PL mPFC calcium activity dynamics and key addiction criteria, highlighting a critical role of this brain region in the development of food addiction. Understanding these neurobiological differences enhances our insight into brain mechanisms underlying loss of eating control and may inform more targeted approaches for studying and ultimately treating food addiction.",

    "content": "Visuospatial neglect (VSN) after right-hemisphere stroke causes reduced engagement with left-sided stimuli, but how VSN affects automatic processes, i.e. the registration of regularities and regularity violations is still equivocal. This study investigated these processes using event-related potential components C1, C2/N1, and the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), and how they differ in VSN compared to stroke and healthy controls, and their changes with time and rehabilitation. We applied a passive oddball paradigm, where diamond patterns periodically disappeared (OFF events) and reappeared (ON events) on the lower left and right sides, creating two simultaneous but independent sequences with standard and deviant events. The study included a VSN group (N=17, M=53.88{+/-}0.28 yrs); stroke patients (N=16, M = 56.81{+/-}13.26 yrs); and healthy participants (N=17, M=53.89{+/-}10.79 yrs). The VSN group underwent measurements three times: pre- and post-rehabilitation, and at a 4-month follow-up. Our results show that the C1 component emerged reliably in healthy participants and as a tendency in stroke controls, but not in VSN at any measurement point. The C2/N1 component emerged for all events without group differences. VSN patients showed no reliable vMMN, while it emerged in stroke patients for left-sided OFF events. Healthy controls showed vMMN in every condition. Our results suggest that both stroke and VSN impair the automatic detection of regularity violations, but VSN does so in a more substantial way, and this deficit does not improve with time or rehabilitation. Furthermore, the missing C1 component in VSN may indicate an early-stage deficiency even in visual processing.",

    "title": "Spatial auditory change detection in listeners with hearing loss",
    "content": "Everyday listening relies on the auditory system's ability to automatically monitor the background soundscape and detect new or changing sources. Although change detection is a fundamental aspect of situational awareness, little is known about how hearing impairment affects this ability. This study examined how sensorineural hearing loss influences spatial auditory change detection. Older hearing-impaired listeners (N = 30) completed a spatial change detection task requiring them to identify the appearance of a new sound source within a complex spatialised acoustic scene. Hearing loss was characterised by three factors that were measured with standard clinical tests: audiometric hearing thresholds, sensitivity to small level changes, and sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation. Simple and mixed-effects linear models were used to test how these factors predicted reaction time, hit rate, and false alarm rate. Listeners with poorer spectrotemporal sensitivity, higher audiometric hearing thresholds, and older age showed slower and less accurate detection, whereas sensitivity to small changes in level did not predict outcomes. Detection also varied with spatial location, where appearing sources from behind were detected more slowly and less accurately than those from the front or sides. Numerical analysis using head-related transfer functions confirmed that these rear-field effects were unlikely to be explained by overall or frequency-specific acoustic level differences. These findings reveal that hearing loss, age, and spatial factors jointly shape listeners' ability to monitor dynamic auditory scenes. Additionally, testing spectrotemporal sensitivity offers a promising clinical measure of non-speech auditory processing with relevance for hearing-aid fitting and situational awareness.",

    "content": "Voltage imaging demands technical innovations to realize its full potential in neuroscience. Although two-photon microscopy is widely used in brain research, its imaging speed is insufficient for high-throughput voltage recordings. To overcome this limitation, we developed an all-optical beam multiplexing engine via retroreflection from two near-parallel mirrors. This approach integrates seamlessly with standard two-photon microscopes, enabling kilohertz-frame-rate imaging across a 16-fold expanded field of view while maintaining synaptic resolution. Operating at over 220 megapixels per second, it enables submillisecond imaging of dendritic propagation of action potentials and simultaneous voltage recording from more than 200 hippocampal neurons in head-fixed, behaving mice. This advancement unlocks new possibilities for large-scale, high-speed functional studies in neuroscience.",

    "title": "Reduction of A\u03b225-35-Induced Cognitive Impairments in C57BL/6 Mice Through Focused Ultrasound Thermal-Cycling Stimulation",
    "content": "Hyperthermia (HT) is recognized across various medical disciplines for its capacity to modulate specific protein expressions. In efforts to improve Alzheimer's disease (AD), HT has the potential to regulate heat shock proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant enzymes, which helps decrease the aberrant accumulation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) protein and oxidative stress. Nonetheless, the precise delivery of mild hyperthermia to the brain remains a significant challenge. To apply mild hyperthermia targeted to the brain and evaluate its impact on cognitive improvement, this study used focused ultrasound (FUS) to administer localized mild hyperthermia to the brains of AD mouse induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35. For considerations of safety and therapeutic efficacy, a thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) protocol was adapted into a focused ultrasound thermal-cycling stimulation (FUS-TCS), which was compared with the continuous focused ultrasound hyperthermia stimulation (FUS-HTS). The findings revealed that the FUS-TCS treatment group exhibited a significant improvement in cognitive performance, as evidenced by enhanced outcomes in the Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Furthermore, this group demonstrated increased expression of A{beta}-degrading enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). These results suggest that localized mild hyperthermia targeting the brain using FUS-TCS treatment represents a promising strategy for ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with AD.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "Serotonergic neuron-glioma interactions drive high-grade glioma pathophysiology",
    "content": "High-grade gliomas are lethal brain cancers that are powerfully regulated by glutamatergic neurons through activity-dependent paracrine factors and functional neuron-to-glioma synapses. Here, we report that serotonergic neurons promote the proliferation of high-grade gliomas throughout the brain. Serotonergic neuronal activity drives circuit-specific increases in high-grade glioma proliferation, calcium transients, and reduced survival. This growth-promoting effect is chiefly mediated by activation of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) receptor 5HT2A on glioma cells. Knock out or pharmacological blockade of 5HT2A receptors in glioma abrogated the glioma growth-promoting effects of serotonergic neuronal activity, while serotonergic psychedelic drugs robustly promote malignant cell proliferation. Gliomas alter serotonergic neuronal activity patterns, resulting in elevated serotonin release into the tumor microenvironment. Together, these findings uncover pathogenic, feed-forward interactions between serotonergic neurons and glioma cells.",

    "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Gain and loss of function changes in CACNA1C affect neuronal networks through divergent pathways",
    "content": "Background: CACNA1C encodes the pore-forming subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2. Common variants in CACNA1C are associated with psychiatric disorders, while rare single-nucleotide variants cause CACNA1C-related disorder (CRD), a multi-system disorder with symptoms that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and seizures. However, the cellular mechanisms linking CACNA1C dysfunction to neurodevelopmental phenotypes remain poorly understood. Methods: We generated isogenic CACNA1C loss-of-function (LoF) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and reprogrammed a line from an individual carrying a novel gain-of-function (GoF) variant in CACNA1C. Neuronal activity was assessed using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), pharmacological manipulation, and gene expression analysis. Early developmental phenotypes were examined using qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing. Results: LoF and GoF patient-derived neurons displayed opposing alterations in network dynamics. Pharmacological and molecular assays indicated that these network differences were associated with dysregulated GABAergic signalling. Early developmental analysis revealed that loss of CACNA1C altered rosette morphology, CREB phosphorylation, and transcriptional programs related to axonogenesis and synaptic signalling, indicating effects on neuronal differentiation. The patient line exhibited opposing phenotypes, reflecting variant-specific effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that Cav1.2 regulates excitatory-inhibitory balance, network organization, and aspects of neurodevelopment. Divergent effects of LoF and GoF variants highlight how altered Cav1.2 signalling contributes to variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including ASD and epilepsy, and establish a framework for defining CACNA1C variant effects in human neurons.",

    "title": "A theory of multi-task computation and task selection",
    "content": "Neural activity during the performance of a stereotyped behavioral task is often described as low-dimensional, occupying only a limited region in the space of all firing-rate patterns. This region has been referred to as the \"neural manifold\" associated with a task. More recently, recordings of neural activity in animals challenged to perform multiple tasks have suggested that each task is associated with a different low-dimensional manifold. What connectivity structures underlie this flexibility in neural dynamics, and how is interference between the dynamics associated with different tasks avoided? We develop a theoretical model for multi-task computation in nonlinear recurrent neural networks whose connectivity is constructed as a weighted sum of many low-rank components, each encoding the dynamics associated with a different task. The model demonstrates that interference between different tasks' dynamics limits flexible multi-tasking and can lead to chaotic fluctuations. However, small modulations of a network's effective connectivity overcome this interference. We derive the conditions that enable such task selection and characterize both single-neuron and population statistics in task-selected and unselected states. The model reveals the requirements for a single network to produce distinct dynamics confined to distinct neural manifolds and suggests circuit mechanisms that support this capability. Using the model, we propose different hypotheses for explaining the origin of high-dimensional neural activity in large-scale recordings.",

    "title": "Title: You Are What You Sync: Neural Synchronization Predicts Religious Affiliation",
    "content": "Existing research has found that shared neural responses to naturalistic narratives are associated with shared understanding, especially within the same social group. In this fMRI study, we tested whether in-group neural synchronization reflects only explicit shared understandings or also relates to other group characteristics. We compared synchronization patterns in two distinct social groups: Religious (N = 21) and Secular (N = 21). Participants were scanned while watching short video clips with religious or neutral content and then answered questions about their reactions and interpretations. Behavioral results did not reveal group differences in the homogeneity of responses: neither in engagement and agreement while watching the videos, nor in the emotions and verbal reactions elicited by them. However, neuroimaging revealed strikingly higher in-group synchronization among Religious participants than among Secular participants, across both religious and neutral narratives. Remarkably, it was possible to predict the religious affiliation of each participant solely from in-group neural synchrony, with accuracy up to 92%. This pattern was consistent across all neural networks, most prominently in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Control, and Attention networks. It also emerged in the Salience network and Somatomotor regions, hinting at neural processes that may foster group cohesion and identification. We propose that increased neural synchrony in the Religious group is driven mainly by a more homogeneous social structure, suggesting a novel perspective on the role of neural synchrony in group dynamics.",

    "content": "The human auditory cortex robustly tracks attended speech, yet it remains unclear if speaker identity is encoded in spatial patterns of neural activity independent of temporal dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that the identity of an attended speaker is reliably reflected in distinct, time-invariant spatial activation maps in human intracranial EEG (iEEG). Leveraging these \"neural fingerprints\", we developed a novel framework for Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) that shifts from traditional temporal envelope tracking to spatial speaker identification. By decoupling the decoding of \"who\" is speaking from \"when\" they are speaking, our modular system achieves state-of-the-art speech extraction, particularly in short time windows (<2 seconds) where temporal models typically fail. Furthermore, we observed a reciprocal shift in neural activity during attentional switches, confirming that these spatial codes dynamically track listener intent. These findings establish that speaker identity is a robust, spatially distributed feature in the auditory cortex, offering a high-speed, complementary mechanism for neuro-steered hearing technologies.",

    "title": "Mapping the circulating proteome across neurodegeneration: A harmonized, consortium-scale framework for uncovering molecular pathophysiology",
    "content": "Large-scale plasma proteomics offers unprecedented opportunities to investigate the systemic biology of neurodegeneration, yet technical heterogeneity, site-specific artifacts, and clinical confounding remain major barriers to reproducible discovery. Leveraging data from 13,733 individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and non-impaired controls in the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC), we present a scalable and generalizable analytical framework for harmonizing and interpreting consortium-scale proteomic datasets. Using a high-dimensional perturbation framework, we systematically benchmark five commonly used batch correction methods across a range of realistic confounding structures, including site-disease imbalance, nonlinear effects, and heteroskedasticity. Empirical Bayes modelling via limma consistently emerged as the most robust method, optimally balancing removal of site-related technical variance with retention of disease-relevant biological signal. On this harmonized foundation, we resolve neurodegenerative disease plasma signatures, including a shared immune-metabolic axis in AD and PD, neuromuscular disruption in ALS, and proteostatic imbalance in PD. Tissue and cell-type enrichment highlight widespread immune-endocrine involvement in AD and hematopoietic activation in PD. Demographically matched analyses nominate distinct, candidate biomarkers across diseases, including lipid, redox, and complement factors in AD, lysosomal and cytoskeletal proteins in PD, and muscle-derived markers in ALS. This study establishes a scalable analytical framework for integrating real-world proteomic data and provides a disease-resolved catalogue of circulating signatures to inform biomarker development and targeted intervention across neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "content": "Reward-predictive cues can become attractive themselves due to incentive salience attribution. This manifests as persistent engagement with cues, known as sign-tracking. Cue-evoked phasic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) is critical for sign-tracking and cue-evoked reward craving, yet is also known to follow learning rules requiring outcome value updating. Would cue-evoked dopamine track incentive salience persistence, or change in accord with reward value alteration while failing to encode persistent behaviors? We assessed NAc dopamine activity using fiber photometry in sign-tracking rats during an omission task, in which physical cue interaction cancels reward. Animals adapted to reward loss while maintaining non-physical cue interaction reflective of persistent incentive salience. Cue-evoked dopamine remained unchanged during omission, mirroring robust incentive salience but not behavioral adaptations occurring with learning. In contrast, outcome-related dopamine reflected reward gain or loss. Therefore, cue-related dopamine encodes persistence of cue value, independent of outcome-related dopamine signals tracking reward occurrence.",

    "content": "Placebo analgesia is a well-established medical phenomenon with overlapping neural representations between humans and rodents, but the genetic contribution to this conserved neural circuitry remains unknown. Using functional brain imaging in 305 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we quantified the heritability of neural activation in placebo analgesia brain circuity during evoked pain, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, brainstem and cerebellum, using the ACE model. Neural responses showed significant heritability, with additive genetics accounting for 21 to 49% of the variance (A = 0.21 to 0.49), indicating that genetics have a moderate effect on pain-evoked brain activity within the placebo analgesia circuitry. For the first time, our findings reveal a heritable component of the neural network supporting placebo analgesia. By linking genetic variations to neural responses in the placebo analgesia circuitry, this study bridges human and preclinical research and opens new ways for improving clinical trial methodology and tailoring pain therapies to individual genetic profiles.",

    "title": "Signatures of covert neuron loss in the local field potential of motor cortex",
    "content": "Background: Covert stroke is understudied despite occurring ten times for every symptomatic stroke and contributing to stroke's enormous global disease burden. For instance, it is unknown whether covert stroke replicates the peri-infarct neuroelectrophysiological frequency spectrum impact of symptomatic stroke. This motivated the use of our novel electrolytic lesioning platform to explore the spectral consequences of covert neuron loss. Methods: During a multi-month period of participation in an arm reaching task, neuron loss was induced via electrolytic lesions to the motor cortex of two large animals (U: n = 4; H: n = 7). Behavioral metrics were paired with spectrum estimates from local field potential recordings. These spectra were represented as bandpowers, aperiodic/periodic parameters, and decomposed time-frequency tensors. Lesion impact was assessed using nonparametric permutation tests of next-day effects and state space model parameters. Results: Task success rate was unaffected by lesions, but shifts in aperiodic structure reduced next-day {gamma} bandpower (30 - 100 Hz; U: -1.38V2, p < 1 x 10-3; H: -1.66V2, p = 0.001) while sensorimotor rhythms spanning 8 - 45 Hz ({Sigma}SMR) were amplified (Monkey U: 8.68V2, p < 1 x 10-3; Monkey H: 2.40V2, p = 0.004). Additionally, state space modeling showed that spectral perturbations to {gamma} and {Sigma}SMR outlasted any behavioral impact of the lesions (Monkey U: Behavior=1 d, {gamma} =2 d, {Sigma}SMR =2 d; Monkey H: Behavior=0 d, {gamma} =3 d, {Sigma}SMR =1 d). Finally, tensor decomposition revealed interpretable, animal-specific perturbations to time-frequency dynamics. Conclusion: Covert neuron loss induced multi-day spectral perturbations similar to those observed after symptomatic stroke. The neural spectrum is thus more sensitive to neuron loss than previously understood and could be responsive to neuron loss caused by covert stroke. This work also motivates the use of electrolytic lesions to bridge covert and symptomatic regimes of neuron loss, advancing our causal understanding of post-stroke interactions between spectrum and behavior.",

    "content": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is traditionally viewed as a brake on motor output. Challenging this model, we investigated its role in value-based decision-making by recording single-neuron activity from the primate STN during a choice task. Our findings reveal that the STN contains functionally distinct clusters of neurons and, contrary to its classical role, the vast majority of task-related neurons (approximately 89%) exhibited activity consistent with action facilitation. Two of the clusters contained facilitative neurons that increased their firing for rewarded choices, and critically, their response latency predicted saccadic reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. Population-level analyses further demonstrated that these facilitative neurons robustly encode the upcoming choice. A smaller third cluster of neurons showed activity consistent with action suppression. These results indicate a dual function of the STN, suggesting it plays a predominant role in actively facilitating desired actions, rather than simply suppressing unwanted ones.",

    "title": "An RF coil array system for in vivo & ex vivo non-human primate brain studies at 10.5 Tesla",
    "content": "Purpose: We aimed to develop an innovative RF coil toolset for high resolution in vivo and ex vivo non-human primate neuroimaging applications at 10.5T MRI. The main goal was to improve our multimodal neural connectivity pipeline through the improved SNR, CNR, and spatial resolution that result from utilizing high-density RF coil arrays in combination with ultra-high field MRI. Methods: Two RF coil arrays, both comprising 8 transmit and 40 receive channels, were designed and built for in vivo and ex vivo NHP imaging at 10.5 T. Experimental data was collected on multiple in vivo and ex vivo specimens, showing the utility UHF MRI for NHP neuroscience. Results: Experimental results demonstrate uniform whole-brain coverage within both in vivo--which included the cerebellar, and spinal cord regions--and ex vivo specimens. High spatial resolutions (in vivo: 0.1x0.1x0.5 mm, ex vivo: 120 micron isotropic) were achieved, revealing detailed anatomical structures throughout. High temporal stability allowed for EPI and dMRI applications. Conclusion: An RF coil toolset comprising two 8ch transmit/40ch receive arrays was successfully designed for both in vivo and ex vivo NHP brain applications at 10.5 T. Both high-density RF coil arrays coupled with the SNR and CNR benefits available at UHF supported unmatched anatomical, functional, and diffusion applications at some of the highest spatial resolutions to date. Additionally, the combined capability of both in vivo and ex vivo MRI with the same brain specimen allows for tighter control for experimental-paradigm multistage studies examining translation between in vivo and ex vivo methodologies.",

    "title": "The BrainHealth Project study protocol: a scalable digital approach to measuring and promoting multidimensional brain health across the lifespan",
    "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",

    "title": "From Hands to Feet: Experience-Driven Plasticity in Secondary Somatosensory Cortex in People Born without Hands",
    "content": "In congenital handlessness, where individuals rely on their feet for compensatory manual functions, reorganization in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) appears limited to local shifts by adjacent body parts. It remains unclear how congenital handlessness and lifelong compensatory foot use shape the sensorimotor system beyond SI, and whether compensatory abilities can drive broader functional reorganization. Here, we used task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how compensatory foot use changes body representations in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in people born without hands (individuals with upper-limb dysplasia, IDs). We found that IDs showed foot selectivity in the left hand-selective SII, with stronger foot activity than typically-developed (TD) control participants during action execution. Notably, this reorganization in the left SII hand area cannot simply be explained by this area's intrinsic organization - the typical secondary preference of this area in the TDs when hand responses are excluded, as this area in TDs shows shoulder - but not foot - selectivity when the hand activity is excluded. This indicates a functional reorganization dependent on the IDs' sensorimotor experience. Resting-state results further revealed altered functional connectivity between SII and primary sensorimotor regions in IDs. Our findings suggest that SII exhibits flexible, experience-dependent plasticity, revealing a hierarchical principle of cortical plasticity, whereby reorganization in the SI is constrained by somatotopic principles while SII reflects functionally or experience-dependent plasticity.",

    "title": "Poorer physical function is associated with elevated spatial entropy in the aging brain network landscape",
    "content": "Life is a constant struggle against disorder. As we age, our ability to maintain internal order declines. In the healthy human brain, order is observable in the form of functionally segregated brain network communities that exhibit spatial consistency. These communities associate with distinct cognitive and physical functions. When mapped into the brain, they form a functional landscape. We assessed the spatial disorder of these landscapes in older adults with a wide range of mobility using a modified version of Shannon entropy. We found that compared to younger adults, older adults had significantly higher entropy in the sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and occipital lobe. Higher entropy in many of these regions was associated with worse physical function and higher body mass index in older adults. Findings suggest that spatial entropy in brain network landscapes may be a marker of declining physical function. Modifiable factors, such as losing excess weight, may help to ameliorate aging-related brain entropy increases in regions such as the sensorimotor cortex, which may in turn help to preserve physical function in older adults.",

    "title": "Motor System Oligodendroglia Atlas Reveals Activation States Associated with Region-Specific Vulnerability in ALS",
    "content": "Oligodendrocytes, the second most abundant cell type in the motor cortex and the most abundant in the spinal cord, are increasingly recognized as active contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Yet their diversity and disease relevance in the central nervous system remain incompletely defined. Here, we generate a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of 176 samples, integrating 2 in-house and 16 publicly available datasets. It encompasses more than 1,000,000 cells (350,000 oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors) from the human motor cortex and spinal cord in non-neurological controls and ALS patients. We identify a previously unrecognized oligodendrocyte subpopulation, marked by PPEF1, and uncover regional differences, with distinct OPALIN+ and RBFOX1+ oligodendrocyte proportions between cortex and spinal cord. Importantly, we demonstrate that 'disease-associated oligodendrocytes' (DAOs) represent a distinct activation state, rather than a distinct subpopulation. In ALS, spinal cord oligodendrocytes selectively shift toward reactive states, characterized by JUND-enriched regulon activity, heightened metabolic demand, increased intercellular signaling, and activation of cell-death pathways. Finally, we identify LRP2 as a novel transcriptional oligodendrocyte marker and find LRP2 and MBP proteins to be elevated in ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a potential biomarker of oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Our study provides a systems-level framework to interpret oligodendrocyte and OPC changes in ALS, linking cell state shifts to molecular alterations that can guide biomarker and therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Lysosomal swelling triggers LRRK2 activity",
    "content": "LRRK2 is implicated in lysosomal functions, but the physiological upstream cues that engage endogenous LRRK2 activity are incompletely defined. Here we show that lysosomal swelling serves as a selective and reversible trigger for LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation, without requiring membrane damage. Acute inhibition of PIKfyve, but not the general disruption of phosphoinositide signaling, induces the robust accumulation of phosphorylated Rabs across endolysosomal membranes. Rescue of swelling through pharmacological restoration of lysosomal ionic imbalances from PIKfyve inhibition suppresses LRRK2 activation without restoring lysosomal function. Mechanical lysosomal swelling from indigestible osmolyte uptake causes a dose-dependent increase in LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation on both swollen and non-swollen lysosomes. Together, these findings identify LRRK2 as a sensor of lysosomal volume and mechanical stress, not specifically membrane damage or PIKfyve inhibition. As lysosomal swelling is a shared pathological feature across LRRK2-linked diseases, these results reframe LRRK2 as part of an endolysosomal surveillance system responsive to lysosomal distension.",

    "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
    "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

    "title": "Ischemic stroke induces persistent alteration to brain stromal progenitor cells linked to chronic vascular dysfunction",
    "content": "Fibrotic scar formation after stroke serves a dual role: while essential for providing structural support during post-ischemic recovery, excessive fibrosis in the chronic phase of stroke impairs regenerative processes including axonal regrowth and neovascularization. The temporal dynamics of fibrosis are critical determinants of functional outcomes, as the balance between protective scarring and regenerative capacity differs across distinct stroke phases. Consequently, strategic modulation of fibrotic processes to preserve regenerative potential represents a promising therapeutic approach in stroke recovery. To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this fibrotic response, we investigated stromal progenitor cell composition in the post-stroke brain. The vast majority of stromal progenitor cells (SPCs) are pericytes, with minorities comprising perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) and vascular smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that ischemic stroke drives a long-term shift in this composition, characterized by sustained expansion of the PVF population and excessive laminin deposition in the peri-infarct region-effects that persist for at least six months post-stroke. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed sustained transcriptional and compositional alterations in the SPC population throughout chronic post-stroke phase, driven by AP-1-mediated signaling via TNF in both PVFs and pericytes. These changes correlate with long-term vasomotor dysfunction and capillary constriction in the peri-infarct region at six weeks post-stroke. Ischemic stroke drives aberrant, persistent PVF accumulation at the capillary bed with implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular dysfunction and recurrent stroke. Taken together, these findings reveal that ischemic stroke drives an aberrant long-term mis-localization of PVFs to the capillary bed that may have clinically-relevant implications for post-stroke cerebrovascular function as well as potential ramifications for recurrent stroke.",

    "title": "A Python tool to diagnose how functions behave when inputs are missing (None / NaN)",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>I built a small experimental Python tool called <strong>doubt</strong> that helps diagnose how functions behave when parts of their inputs are missing. I encountered this issue in my day to day data science work. We always wanted to know how a piece of code/function will behave in case of missing data(NaN usually) e.g. a function to calculate average of values in a list. Think of any business KPi which gets affected by missing data. </p> <p>The tool works by: - injecting missing values (e.g. <code>None</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>pd.NA</code>) into function inputs one at a time - re-running the function against a baseline execution - classifying the outcome as: - crash - silent output change - type change - no impact</p> <p>The intent is not to replace unit tests, but to act as a diagnostic lens to identify where functions make implicit assumptions about data completeness and where defensive checks or validation might be needed.</p> <hr /> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is primarily aimed at: - developers working with data pipelines, analytics, or ETL code - people dealing with real-world, messy data where missingness is common - early-stage debugging and code hardening rather than production enforcement</p> <p>It\u2019s currently best suited for relatively pure or low-side-effect functions and small to medium inputs.<br /> The project is early-stage and experimental, and not yet intended as a drop-in production dependency.</p> <hr /> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Compared to existing approaches: - <strong>Unit tests</strong> require you to anticipate missing-data cases in advance; <code>doubt</code> explores missingness sensitivity automatically. - <strong>Property-based testing (e.g. Hypothesis)</strong> can generate missing values, but requires explicit strategy and property definitions; <code>doubt</code> focuses specifically on mapping missing-input impact without needing formal invariants. - <strong>Fuzzing / mutation testing</strong> typically perturbs code or arbitrary inputs, whereas <code>doubt</code> is narrowly scoped to data missingness, which is a common real-world failure mode in data-heavy systems.</p> <hr /> <h3>Example</h3> <p>```python from doubt import doubt</p> <p>@doubt() def total(values): return sum(values)</p> <p>total.check([1, 2, 3]) ```</p> <hr /> <p>Installation</p> <p>The package is not on PyPI yet.

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "Robust automated preclinical fMRI preprocessing via a multi-stage dilated convolutional Swin Transformer affine registration",
    "content": "IntroductionAccurate preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is crucial for effective analysis in preclinical studies. Key steps such as denoising, skull-stripping, and affine registration are essential to align fMRI data with a standard atlas. However, challenges such as low resolution, variations in brain geometry, and limited dataset sizes often hinder the performance of traditional and deep learning-based methods.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a preclinical fMRI preprocessing pipeline that integrates advanced deep learning modules, with a particular focus on a newly developed Swin Transformer-based affine registration method. The pipeline incorporates our previously established modules for 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based denoising and Transformer-based skull stripping, followed by the proposed Multi-stage Dilated Convolutional Swin Transformer (MsDCSwinT) for affine registration. This new registration method captures both local and global spatial misalignments, ensuring accurate alignment with a standard atlas even in challenging preclinical datasets.ResultsWe validate the pipeline across multiple preclinical fMRI studies and demonstrate that our affine registration module achieves higher average Dice similarity coefficients compared to state-of-the-art methods.DiscussionBy leveraging GANs and Transformers, our pipeline offers a robust, accurate, and fully automated solution for preclinical fMRI.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "title": "Effects of height-induced postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance in healthy individuals: a systematic review with meta-analysis",
    "content": "BackgroundHeight-induced postural threat, such as standing or walking at elevation, elicits fear-related adaptations in balance control. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for interpreting motor behavior under anxiety and for informing rehabilitation and fall-prevention interventions. However, no previous systematic review with meta-analysis has quantified how height exposure influences balance performance.ObjectiveThe objective was to aggregate, characterize, and quantify the effects of height-related postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance.MethodsA systematic literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus was conducted from their inception date until 15 September 2025. Eligible cross-sectional studies compared ground-level (no threat) versus elevated (threat) conditions in healthy participants. Static balance outcomes during upright stance included sway amplitude and frequency; dynamic balance outcomes while walking included gait velocity. Included studies were coded for gender, age, postural threat conditions, balance assessment/outcome, and test modality. Methodological study quality/design and risk of bias was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics, and sensitivity was evaluated via Leave-One-Out method. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated and analyses were stratified by age group (i.e., children, young adults, older adults).ResultsThe search identified a total of N\u202f=\u202f438 records, and 25 of them (involving a total of 877 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Concerning static balance (18 studies, 44 comparisons), postural threat resulted in small-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.20) decreases in sway amplitude measures and in large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.06) increases in sway frequency measures, indicating a potentially protective \u201cstiffening\u201d response. However, children did not use the \u201cstiffening\u201d response when standing at height (sway amplitude: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.41; sway frequency: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.04). Regarding dynamic balance (7 studies, 16 comparisons), postural threat led to large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.33) declines in gait velocity, and this was more pronounced for conditions with a high (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.78) than a low (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.05) difficulty level.ConclusionHeight-induced postural threat evoked functional changes in static (i.e., decrease/increase in sway amplitude/frequency measures) and dynamic (i.e., decrease in walking speed measures) postural control. For static balance this is indicative of an effective \u201cstiffening\u201d response which is apparently not yet developed in children. For the dynamic balance, the further decrease in gait velocity during difficult walking conditions at height implies a compensatory mechanism to increase stability. Despite consistent direction and magnitude of effects, substantial between-study heterogeneity limits the generalizability of these findings, and results should therefore be interpreted with caution.",

    "title": "Lightweight deep learning models for EEG decoding: a review",
    "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

    "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
    "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",

    "content": "Neural activity is selective for the identity and semantic category of natural visual stimuli. In human neuroimaging, this selectivity can be investigated using multivariate pattern analysis. The resulting neural information is thought to reflect neural processes underlying object recognition. However, due to the complexity of natural stimuli, it remains unclear to what extent different visual features drive this information. To address this, we presented natural stimuli from different categories as well as several degraded versions, in which specific visual features were selectively manipulated, to human participants while recording magnetoencephalography (MEG). We applied multivariate pattern analysis and decomposed the resulting high-dimensional neural representational geometry into its distinct contributions from retinotopy, total spatial frequency and orientation energy, global shape, local shape, and textural correlation structure. These features contributed differentially to the neural information, with retinotopy and global shape being the strongest features underlying image and category information, respectively.

    "content": "<p>I built Jottings because I was tired of my own thoughts getting trapped inside algorithmic feeds where I had to perform. There was a huge mental load before posting something on X or Instagram.<p>Every time I wanted to share something small or unfinished, I opened Twitter and lost 20 minutes to the timeline. Writing a blog post felt too heavy for those smaller, quick thoughts. I just wanted a place to write something down quickly and hit publish.<p>Jottings is that place. It gives you a clean microblog on a domain you own. Posts show up in simple chronological order. No likes. No followers. No feed trying to decide what matters.<p>What Jottings is\n- A microblogging platform that builds fully static microblog sites\n- A free subdomain (you.jottings.me) or connect your own domain on PRO plans\n- Markdown, tags, RSS feed, links with preview, and image uploads\n- An optional AI writing helper when you are stuck or lazy to fix grammar\n- Optimized for SEO and AI search friendly\n- Analytics for your sites<p>What it is not\n- Not a social network\n- Not an engagement funnel\n- Not trying to keep you on the site\n- Not a replacement for long-form blogging, though you can use it that way<p>How it works\nEach Jot publish triggers a static site rebuild. The site is stored in Cloudflare R2 and served directly at the edge. Custom domains go through Cloudflare SSL for SaaS.\nI built it to be boring, reliable (barring Cloudflare's latest issues), and cheap to run.<p>Pricing\nFree tier for a subdomain, text posts, and a lot more.\nUSD5 per month for custom domains, images, full Markdown, and the writing helper.\nI priced it to be an easy yes.<p>Limitations\n- No comments (on purpose)\n- No native apps yet (iOS is coming)\n- The writing helper is helpful but not magic\n- I am a solo founder, so features move at human speed<p>I use Jottings regularly to document what I build. It has been the lowest-friction way I have found to publish anything publicly.<p>Demo of Jottings site for product updates: <a href=\"https://jottings.jottings.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.jottings.me/</a>\nDemo of my personal Jottings site: <a href=\"https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com</a> (with custom subdomain)<p>I would love feedback from this community. What would make this better or more useful for you?<p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://jottings.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.me</a> (2 min set up)\nFeel free to write to me at vishal@vishalvshekkar.com<p>\u2014 Vishal</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242071\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242071</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "content": "IntroductionThe relationship between glaucoma and neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex has yet to be fully explored and understood. This study employs the time-domain (TD) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to noninvasively monitor the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in the visual cortex.Methods203 eyes (104 subjects, 46 females, 58 males): 44 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 38 with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 54 with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 67 without abnormal/pathologic condition, were analyzed. All subjects had a complete eye examination, including Goldmann tonometry, computerized visual field optical coherence tomography, pattern electroretinogram, and visual evoked potentials. Visual cortex HRF was assessed by TD-fNIRS using a standard stimulation protocol (reversed checkerboard at 10\u202fHz). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to obtain groups (clusters) of eyes based on the respective TD-fNIRS parameters. The relationships between the clusters and the diagnostic groups were assessed by comparing the distributions of the former ones among healthy, hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes.ResultsWe found six clusters of eyes, five representing eyes with consistent measurements of HRF amplitudes across acquisition channels (left/right hemisphere) and repeated stimuli, distinguished by distinct magnitudes of neurovascular coupling. The sixth cluster included all the cases of incoherent HRF patterns. Evidence of a different distribution between glaucomatous and healthy eyes was found (p\u202f=\u202f0.0009), suggesting that high levels of neurovascular coupling are less likely to be observed in NTG and OAG groups.ConclusionOccipital TD-fNIRS could be fruitfully implemented in a clinical setting to provide significant and easy-to-get insights on neurovascular dynamics, supporting the differential diagnosis of glaucomatous patients. Our findings highlight the importance of the underappreciated correlates between glaucoma and overall neurologic status.",

Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

    "content": "Hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, and tooth enamel defects syndrome (HADDTS) is a recently identified disorder linked to a heterozygous mutation in the C-terminal Binding Protein 1 (CTBP1) transcriptional corepressor. The predominant mutation (p.R342W) is located within the major protein binding cleft (PXDLS), crucial for CtBP1\u2019s interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. To investigate the mutation\u2019s functional consequences, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent cell lines (iPSCs) carrying the CTBP1 mutation in heterozygous and homozygous conditions using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing method. The transcriptional profile of iPSC-derived early neurons from the isogenic wild type and CTBP1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants was determined by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data revealed downregulation of several key transcription factors, with homozygous mutations causing more pronounced downregulation compared to heterozygous mutations. Isogenic mutant neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibited reduced adhesion and migration, along with dysregulated calcium signaling, while mutant neurons showed premature neurite outgrowth. Together, our transcriptomic and biological results provide novel insights into the role and mechanism of CTBP1 p.R342W mutation in the defective neurodevelopmental processes.",

    "title": "Central auditory processing is altered after traumatic brain injury in Tanzanian adults",
    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",

    "title": "The interaction of regulated forms of cell death in the pathogenesis of severe facial paralysis and potential therapeutic strategies",
    "content": "Neuronal cell death plays a central role in the pathogenesis of facial paralysis. In the constructed severe facial paralysis model, axonal damage becomes the key factor triggering retrograde neuronal degeneration, resulting in a large number of neuronal deaths, which seriously affects the function of the facial nerve. The basic fibroblast growth factor exhibits strong neuroprotective ability and can significantly reduce the neuronal mortality rate, providing a strong guarantee for neuronal survival. Viral infection is also an important pathogenic factor that cannot be ignored. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 can trigger neuroinflammation through the immune response, further exacerbating nerve damage. However, recent studies have also brought hope. Neural reconstruction techniques, targeted drugs, and stem cell therapies hold potential value in promoting the recovery of damaged neural functions. These research results reveal that multiple factors affect the survival and function of neurons in facial paralysis through different pathways, laying a theoretical foundation for targeted treatment against neuronal death. In the future, based on these mechanisms, developing new therapies will bring new treatment opportunities for patients with severe facial paralysis, potentially improving their prognosis and significantly enhancing their quality of life, with important clinical value.",

We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.",

We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10058v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.",

However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.",

We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10257v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In smart-home voice assistant scenario, deciding whether to accept or reject a user query is the first step before any downstream processing. To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios. This work provides a reproducible data foundation, evaluation standard and extensible technical framework for reliability research in smart-home voice interaction.",

The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows.",

Normally 3D input device is used for 3D tasks since they perform better than traditional 2D input devices. However, they do not perform better for 2D tasks. This paper presents a bimanual hybrid user interface that supports four interaction modes: a dual 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) input device mode, a dual planar constrained 3DOF input device mode, a dual 2-finger multi-touch mode, and 3D hand and finger gestures. The application is a multi-dimensional visualization with coordinated 3D and 2D views on a desktop VR system. The input devices are buttonballs with seamless switching between 3D and 2D device modes, as well as between free-hand finger input and device usage. The 3D and 2D device mode switch automatically switches a buttonball's visual representation between a 3D cursor and a 2D cursor while changing the available user interaction techniques between 3D and 2D interaction techniques to interact with the coordinated views. The paper also provides two formal user studies to evaluate HyFinBall for various dimensional tasks, including 3D, 2D, and cross-dimensional tasks. Our experimental results show the benefits of the HyFinBall interface for cross-dimensional tasks that require 3D and 2D interactions.",

(2025) of the ``perfect\" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent \"entropic forces\" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive while avoiding jargon and lengthy technical details.",

Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and anesthetics by activating medial habenula (MHb) and/or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) induce unawareness and slowdown respiration. MHb projects to IPN and both increase their glucose intake during anesthesia (Herkenham, 1981). The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? I found that it promotes SWS, memory replay, sharp-wave ripples, spindles, hippocampo-cortical replay, synaptogenesis, rest and recovery, by activating median raphe (MRN) serotonin, and by inhibiting the theta state circuit, new memories encoding, awareness, arousal, alert wakefulness, and REM sleep. It causes also natural slowdown of respiration and heart rate, while it inhibits locomotion and arousal. This extended model adds role of the dentate gyrus>posterior septum>MHb>IPN>MRN>hippocampus + BF + claustrum>cortical slow-waves in memory replay, ripples, loss of awareness, SWS, and anesthesia. It proposes new neural mechanism for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN>MRN>claustrum>cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. My model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence, and wanting. This model claims that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-protein production, spines growth, and anti-inflammatory state.",

    "content": "arXiv:2502.15440v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for nonstationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization through dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting more efficient computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10011v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10844v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We develop here a stochastic framework for modeling and segmenting transient spindle- like oscillatory bursts in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. At the modeling level, individ- ual spindles are represented as path realizations of a two-dimensional Ornstein{Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a stable focus, providing a low-dimensional stochastic dynamical sys- tem whose trajectories reproduce key morphological features of spindles, including their characteristic rise{decay amplitude envelopes. On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order. The resulting framework provides a data- driven framework for the analysis of transient oscillations in EEG and, more generally, in nonstationary time series.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10834v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Allometric scaling laws, such as Kleiber's law for metabolic rate, highlight how efficiency emerges with size across living systems. The brain, with its characteristic sublinear scaling of activity, has long posed a puzzle: why do larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates? Here we show that this economy of scale is a universal outcome of avalanche dynamics. We derive analytical scaling laws directly from avalanche statistics, establishing that any system governed by critical avalanches must exhibit sublinear activity-size relations. This theoretical prediction is then verified in integrate-and-fire neuronal networks at criticality and in classical self-organized criticality models, demonstrating that the effect is not model-specific but generic. The predicted exponents align with experimental observations across mammal species, bridging dynamical criticality with the allometry of brain metabolism. Our results reveal avalanche criticality as a fundamental mechanism underlying Kleiber-like scaling in the brain.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The full connectome of an adult Drosophila enables a search for novel neural structures in the insect brain. I describe a new neural structure, called a Parallel Neuron Group (PNG). Two neurons are called parallel if they share a significant number of input neurons and output neurons. Most pairs of neurons in the Drosophila brain have very small parallel match. There are about twenty larger groups of neurons for which any pair of neurons in the group has a high match. These are the parallel groups. Parallel groups contain only about 1000 out of the 65,000 neurons in the brain, and have distinctive properties. There are groups in the right mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the lobula, and in two central neuropils (GNG and EB). Most parallel groups do not have lateral symmetry. A group usually has one major input neuron, which inputs to all the neurons in the group, and a small number of major output neurons. The major input and output neurons are laterally asymmetric. Parallel neuron groups present puzzles, such as: what does a group do, that could not be done by one larger neuron? Do all neurons in a group fire in synchrony, or do they perform different functions? Why are they laterally asymmetric? These may merit further investigation.",

    "title": "Altered Brain Network Topology during Successful Response Inhibition in Children with Binge Eating",
    "content": "Aim: Although a risk factor for the later development of eating disorders, few studies examine the neural underpinnings of binge eating (BE) in children. Preliminary evidence suggests a role of the corticostriatal system; the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the inhibitory control brain network for risk of BE in children. Methods: Data from 65 children with BE (57% girls) and 84 matched controls (52% girls) from the 4.0 baseline release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were included. Stop Signal Task-based fMRI data were analyzed using graph theoretic techniques. Global and nodal network properties (e.g. efficiency, betweenness-centrality) were compared for between-group differences and sex-by-group interactions. Results: Despite comparable behavioral performance, children with BE showed significantly increased nodal efficiency of the right postcentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and increased connectedness of the right postcentral gyrus compared to control children. Children with BE showed distinct network hubs including the right MFG and left insula, while controls had distinct hubs in the right orbitofrontal and left fusiform gyri. Group-specific sex differences were found in the functioning of insular and frontal cortices. Conclusion: Increased efficiency and connectedness in frontal and parietal nodes of the inhibitory control network functioning in children with BE may represent a vulnerability for overeating. Distinct sex differences in functioning in children with BE compared to control children may reflect specific vulnerabilities to BE in the inhibitory control system in boys and girls that may contribute to sex differences in prevalence.",

    "content": "Brain-body interactions are essential for physical and emotional homeostasis. The brain uses information from the external world to predict upcoming bodily changes. This process involves interoceptive predictions, which are thought to play a central role in brain-body interactions. Yet there is little direct experimental evidence causally linking interoceptive predictions to regulation of bodily physiology. Here we address this by focusing on insular cortex and glucose homeostasis. We find that just before the onset of a meal, insular cortex exhibits a transient burst of activity, reflecting a prediction of the future metabolic state. This transient predictive burst of activity is essential for anticipatory insulin release, subsequent post-meal insulin release, post-meal glucose and lipid homeostasis, and post-meal metabolism signaling in the liver. Our results highlight that insular cortex predictive computations are essential for anticipatory physiological control and for subsequently maintaining metabolic homeostasis.",

    "content": "Neurovascular coupling refers to the regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activity, a process forming the basis for multiple functional neuroimaging techniques. However, the mechanisms that coordinate neurovascular responses across distinct cortical arterial territories remain poorly understood. Here we show that pial collaterals, arterio-arterial connections traditionally considered dormant under physiological conditions, serve as active conduits that propagate neurovascular signals between adjacent cortical territories and functional units. We demonstrate that neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex triggers direct vascular signaling via endothelial Kir2.1 channels through pial collaterals, synchronizing blood flow responses beyond the activated area. The loss of pial collaterals abolished inter-territorial coupling without affecting local neurovascular responses. These results reveal that pial collaterals are critical regulators of cerebral perfusion.",

    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

It has been proposed that cortical memory is subserved by gated recurrency, a powerful machine learning method that enables memory of sequential dependencies. However, standard forms lack biological realism. We built a computational model using a subtractive form of gated recurrency, consistent with cortical circuitry and feedback that resembles corticofugal projections. This architecture outperformed state-of-the-art models with delay lines or non-biological gated recurrency at predicting auditory cortical responses to natural sounds. Its performance was further improved by incorporating a network layer that mirrors the high neuronal density in superficial cortical layers. Analyzing the model, we found that memory retention is longer in secondary than in primary auditory cortex, and that gated recurrency particularly helps capture responses during abrupt changes and quiet periods in the sounds. This work lays out the fundamental functional circuitry of the auditory pathway for processing the sequential dependencies in natural sounds.",

    "title": "Brain Dynamics During the Resting State",
    "content": "Functional MRI in the absence of tasks reveals dynamic large-scale configurations. Yet important gaps in our understanding remain: (1) What type of dynamics are observed during brain states? (2) What type of dynamics are observed between brain states? We address these questions by developing a multi-level Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) model, which jointly estimates state-specific equations of motion and probabilistic state transitions. Within states, the inferred dynamics were stable attractors: model estimated fixed points closely matched observed fMRI activity. A central finding was that dynamic states did not map one-to-one onto canonical static large-scale networks; instead, the relationship was many-to-many, with each state engaging multiple networks and each network participating in several states. For example, a default-mode related state also engaged attention/control net-works. Between states, transitions were structured (i.e., non-random) and heterogeneous. While some state transitions were relatively abrupt in terms of fMRI activity change (e.g., between a default-related network and an attention/control-related network), others were much smoother. Indeed, vector-field analyses in latent space quantified both toggle-like (abrupt) switches and smoother changes, revealing distinct transition pathways. To link systems-level organization to brain regions, we introduced region-level dynamics importance and state transition importance measures. Subcortical regions, particularly basal ganglia structures, dominated the dynamics of the highest-occupancy state, suggesting corticostriatal loops may scaffold a baseline regime from which excursions into other states arise. Importantly, regions most influential for within-state dynamics sometimes differed from those driving state transitions, demonstrating that fMRI signal magnitude alone does not uniquely uncover how regions contribute to system-level properties. Our SLDS framework provides a principled bridge between discrete-state and continuous-trajectory perspectives of resting state dynamics, clarifying what the brain does while in a state and how it moves between states during rest.",

    "content": "In M/EEG analyses, it is often convenient to extract time series of activity originating from the regions of interest (ROIs). However, due to the spread of electric and magnetic fields, M/EEG recordings capture activity from all sources within the brain. Commonly used approaches for the extraction of ROI activity only partially alleviate this problem, and field spread remains a challenge even at the level of ROI time series. Because of the remaining field spread (RFS), the extracted time series captures activity not only from the considered ROI but also from other regions (not necessarily neighboring ones). The amount of RFS can strongly affect the validity of interpretations: with more RFS, the extracted time series becomes less representative of the ROI. However, neither the amount nor the pattern of RFS is usually known. In this study, we apply the cross-talk function (CTF) to analyze contributions of all sources across the brain to the extracted ROI time series, thereby quantifying the degree of RFS. With CTF, we show that the effect of RFS on the extraction of ROI activity and on the estimation of inter-regional connectivity is highly non-uniform across the cortex. In particular, ROIs farther away from the recording sensors are more likely to capture activity and connectivity from other areas. Finally, we validate this observation in simulations and complement it by investigating spurious and ghost interactions in real data. Overall, our results illustrate how CTF can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantify the effects of RFS and to evaluate pipelines for the extraction of ROI activity.",

    "title": "Thermodynamics of consciousness: A non-invasive perturbational framework",
    "content": "The quest for reliable and objective measures of consciousness is critical in basic and clinical neuroscience. Across species, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) has emerged as a robust empirical marker by directly perturbing the brain, yet its underlying principles of physics are not fully understood. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a non-invasive framework based on generative whole-brain models of non-equilibrium brain dynamics. Using these models, we identified violations of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) in humans and rodents across wakefulness, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness. Mirroring the patterns observed with PCI, we found decreased FDT violations in unresponsive disorders of consciousness and anesthesia compared to conscious conditions. This reveals a close link between PCI and non-equilibrium dynamics in spontaneous brain signals, grounding PCI in fundamental principles of physics. Overall, this framework offers new complementary, non-invasive, model-based avenues for understanding the nature of consciousness and for developing objective tools to assess its loss and recovery in health and disease. It also provides a principled foundation for discovering novel strategies to restore consciousness.",

    "title": "Distributed neural dynamics underlie the shift from movement preparation to execution",
    "content": "Dissociating the neural mechanisms of movement preparation from those of execution across the brain is fundamental to understanding motor control. Invasive recordings in primary motor cortex (M1) indicate that shared neural populations support both phases by unfolding within orthogonal subspaces or \"manifolds\", yet whether and how these dynamics evolve across the broader set of brain regions involved in memory-guided skilled action remains poorly understood. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) data obtained during a memory-guided delayed finger-sequence task to track fast population dynamics across M1, premotor cortices, and the hippocampus. Linear discriminant analysis decoding of sequence-specific preparatory and execution patterns revealed a transition from preparation to execution patterns across all regions prior to movement onset. Importantly, the onset of execution exhibited region-specific timing, with M1 shifting last, {approx} 100 ms before the first button press, consistent with the established cortical motor hierarchy. Low-dimensional trajectories showed that preparatory and execution states occupied distinct manifolds, yet were not fully orthogonal, suggesting partial overlap in tuning. MEG dynamics were dominated by peri-movement phase activity in primary motor and premotor regions. Nevertheless, above-chance sequence decoding was recoverable from all motor and premotor regions during execution, and in M1 during preparation. The state shift and the decoding accuracy was driven by distributed modulations across multiple frequency bands, indicating that full-band population dynamics carry richer information than band-limited features alone. These results demonstrate that non-invasive MEG can resolve continuous, hierarchical neural state transitions in the human brain in the context of memory-guided movement control. They offer mechanistic insight into distributed motor-related brain dynamics and support developing brain-computer-interfaces that incorporate signals from multiple brain regions beyond the primary motor cortex.",

    "title": "Activation of cannabinoid receptor CB1 leads to aberrant myelination in development",
    "content": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a widespread role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Cannabinoid receptors like CB1 and CB2 can be activated with exogenous cannabinoids most popularly known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD). The components of the ECS are expressed early in fetal development, and prenatal exposure to cannabis can lead to structural changes in white matter. White matter is composed of neuronal axons ensheathed in myelin, a lipid-rich insulation that facilitates saltatory conduction and maintains axon integrity. In the CNS, myelin is made by specialized glial cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs), which in addition to neurons also express components of the ECS. However, while several studies have focused on how the ECS regulates neuronal development, there is a limited understanding of its impact on OL development or myelin formation. Therefore, our current study set out to understand how pharmacological activation of the ECS alters OL differentiation and myelin formation in vivo. We administered WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55), a CB1 and CB2 agonist, to larval zebrafish and longitudinally analyzed OL development and myelination in vivo. Interestingly, we observed an increase in non-axonal ensheathments in the spinal cord, which appeared to be surrounding neuronal cell bodies. These non-axonal ensheathments were dependent on CB1, as the addition of WIN 55 in a global CB1 mutant prevented this phenotype. Furthermore, this ectopic cell body ensheathment occurred independently from normal myelination processes, as individual OLs did not exhibit changes in the number of myelin sheaths, sheath length, or total myelin output. This study shows that activation of CB receptors in vivo leads to increased non-axonal ensheathment without significantly changing OL differentiation or normal myelin formation. Future studies can further investigate the pathways that drive this phenotype to better understand how exogenous cannabinoid activation can regulate the precision of oligodendrocyte ensheathment.",

    "title": "Modularity in the DCC extracellular domain elicits distinct effects on axon guidance",
    "content": "Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCClong isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects. These results underscore how DCC's distinct modules drive specific developmental responses.",

    "title": "Pre-clinical validation of a novel AAV-mediated gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy improves visual function in a mouse model and expression in patient organoids",
    "content": "Voltage-gated (Kv) potassium channels are critical for neuronal physiology, and their dysfunction can lead to serious consequences. For example, mutations in the silent modulatory Kv8.2 subunit are known to cause irreversible inherited blindness (KCNV2 retinopathy). This is a currently incurable condition that causes lifelong visual loss, reduced visual acuity, photoaversion, night blindness and abnormal colour vision, alongside a distinctive supernormal electrophysiological (ERG) retinal response to light. In this study, we demonstrate that AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a codon-optimised human KCNV2 gene subretinally into Kv8.2 knock-out mice significantly restores retinal function. Treated mice exhibited improved ERG responses and correct expression of KCNV2 and its encoded Kv8.2 protein in photoreceptors. Recovery of visually guided scotopic and photopic optomotor responses to wildtype levels was achieved at lower vector doses, highlighting dose-dependent efficacy. Furthermore, treatment of human retinal organoids derived from a KCNV2 patient iPSC line resulted in substantial Kv8.2 protein rescue. This work provides the first preclinical proof-of-concept for the safety and therapeutic potential of gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy, laying a strong foundation for future clinical trials.",

    "title": "Rac1 contributes to brain connectivity impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex",
    "content": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, leading to constitutive activation of the mTOR complex 1 pathway. Patients commonly present with epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TANDs), including intellectual disability and anxiety. Our previous work identified anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants, characterized by enhanced thigmotaxis. We found that anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants was rescued by Rac1 inhibitors. These findings prompted further investigation into Rac1 signaling in the context of TSC pathology. Using G-LISA and FRET live imaging, we confirmed elevated Rac1 activity in the mutant brains. Rac1 activity was reduced following NSC23766 and EHT1864 treatment. Compared to wild-type controls, Rac1 activity in mutants was elevated by 50% in untreated animals, and reduced by ~30-40% after Rac1 inhibitors. Moreover, aberrant connectivity between brain hemispheres that correlated with anxiety before was restored after Rac1 inhibition. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 1,260 DEGs between homozygous and heterozygous tsc2vu242 zebrafish. Rac1 inhibition restored the expression of approximately 1,000 genes toward wild-type levels. KEGG pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in mTOR signaling and focal adhesion, while GO terms highlighted processes including axon guidance, axonogenesis, and neuronal projection. Collectively, our findings support a functional role for Rac1 in TSC pathology, linking cytoskeletal dysregulation with aberrant axon development and anxiety-like behavior. Rac1 inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for modulating both brain structure and function in TSC-associated anxiety.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Network Dynamics Reveal Alzheimer's Disease Progression",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive disruptions in large-scale brain networks that precede cognitive decline, yet conventional functional connectivity analyses often fail to detect disruptions in coordination among large-scale brain networks that may be critical for early detection. This study leverages quasi periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) to characterize spatiotemporal network alterations across longitudinally stable (normal cognitive, mild cognitive impairment, dementia of Alzheimer's type) and transitioning (normal cognitive to mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment to dementia of Alzheimer's type) cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using resting state fMRI. QPPs were used to derive recurrent spatiotemporal templates and network integrity measures at the intrinsic connectivity network level, while cPCA decomposed Hilbert transformed time series into complex valued patterns that capture amplitude and phase relationships. Nonparametric group comparisons revealed a structured trajectory in which limbic, subcortical, and higher cognition networks, including triple network components, are affected early, followed by progressive disruption in visual, cerebellar, sensorimotor, and additional triple network systems. Transitioning cohorts showed many of these alterations before formal diagnostic conversion, indicating that spatiotemporal signatures carry preclinical information. QPP based metrics were particularly sensitive to limbic and subcortical degradation, whereas cPCA emphasized changes in higher order, visual, and cerebellar patterns, revealing complementary aspects of the same underlying pathology. These findings extend prior QPP only work and highlight the utility of combining QPP and cPCA based measures as a dynamic, network-level biomarker framework for AD progression. with potential applications in early detection, characterizing disease trajectories, and treatment monitoring.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>. It is completely free, but you must register in advance at <a href=\"https://ucdavis.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrc-CtpzorEtBSmZXJINOlLJB9ZR0evpr4\">https://ucdavis.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrc-CtpzorEtBSmZXJINOlLJB9ZR0evpr4</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

    "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
    "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

    "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

    "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
    "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
    "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

    "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

    "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

Applied to dense sampled data of one male and two females in different hormonal states (naturally cycling, oral contraceptive user, pregnancy), we linked inter- and intra-individual fluctuations in brain sex to neuroendocrine modulation. We found lower variation in brain sex across time in the male compared to the female subjects. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a more female-like brain, while (inverted) U-shaped brain sex trajectories emerged across menstrual cycle phases and pregnancy trimesters. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in brain sex capture hormone-related plasticity over time in dense sampled individuals.",

As the majority of Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients also show cerebrovascular pathology, we here aimed to dissect the interactions between AD and ischemic brain injury on the microglial response to amyloid beta pathology. Surprisingly, we find that ischemic stroke in the presence of cerebral amyloid beta-amyloidosis results in the generation of a novel neuroprotective microglial phenotype. These microglia drive a rapid accumulation of highly dense amyloid beta plaques that exhibit a relatively benign nature and are strikingly similar to Amyloid beta plaques observed in patients that are resilient to AD pathology. Thus, our data do not only highlight the impact of a co-morbid state of brain ischemia and amyloid beta pathology on the microglial phenotype but also identify novel molecular pathways that may serve to promote beneficial microglial functions in AD.",

    "content": "Recent advances in anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease have been promising, but they have also highlighted critical challenges, including increased vascular complications, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Emerging evidence suggests that the soluble epoxide hydrolase may be a promising therapeutic target due to the involvement of sEH-derived diols in inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular destabilization. APPPS1 mice were crossed with an inducible soluble epoxide hydrolase knock-out mouse line. The knock-out was induced before onset of amyloid deposition, and then the mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and RNA sequencing techniques. Here, we identify astrocytic soluble epoxide hydrolase as a key mediator of vascular instability in Alzheimer's disease. Targeted astrocyte-specific deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase in APPPS1 mice dramatically mitigated vascular changes, reducing the vascular amyloid burden by 67.95% and preserving VE-cadherin architecture. Importantly, vasomotion was markedly impaired in the Alzheimer's disease model and was preserved in soluble epoxide hydrolase-deficient animals. Transcriptomic profiling of vasculature in APPPS1xsEH{Delta}AC mice revealed upregulated expression of genes critical for neurovascular protection. These findings identify soluble epoxide hydrolase as a central regulator of neurovascular dysfunction and underscore its therapeutic potential in increasing vascular stability in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Artificial hibernation uncovers distinct synaptic engram architecture for memory retention",
    "content": "The memory trace at the neuronal and synaptic levels remains controversial. Stable, larger spines are thought to support memory, but the high turnover of dendritic spines and the drifting of neuronal representations following memory formation suggest alternative possibilities. To elucidate a structural trace underlying memory retention, we utilize a mouse model of artificial hibernation. During hibernation, hippocampal neurons exhibited a substantial reduction in their activity and an extensive elimination of dendritic spines and synapses. Despite these changes, their memory and associated hippocampal neuronal representations are intact after arousal. We find that a subset of spines is maintained during hibernation. These spatially clustered engram-engram synapses are exclusively protected from elimination and characterized by synaptic contacts with multi-synaptic boutons. These findings suggest that synaptic engram architecture, rather than larger spines per se, is resilient to network remodeling and underlies long-term memory retention.",

    "title": "Offline cerebello-cortico-striatal dynamics predict motor strategy exploration and retention in skill learning",
    "content": "Learning a motor skill requires exploring multiple possible solutions to find and retain an optimal strategy. The exploration and consolidation of the motor strategy are usually considered to be segregated respectively between task practice and rest periods. Here we show that two types of offline reactivations of neuronal representations of locomotor strategies in a brain-wide motor circuit are associated with exploration and retention. During short rests between trials, replays of these brainwide representations predict subsequent shifts in strategies indicating that distributed offline processes participate in strategy exploration. Shifts in strategy are consolidated, and their retention follows population reactivation in cerebellar sleep spindles and stabilization of cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity patterns, consistent with the role of spindles in brain plasticity. Overall, motor strategy optimization and consolidation are supported by two intertwined but distinct types of offline distributed reactivation events involving interregional interactions.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized not only by neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction but also by emerging evidence of oligodendrocyte and myelin pathology. Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, disrupts oligodendrocyte homeostasis through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a transcription factor essential for oligodendrocyte maturation, in AD-related glial dysfunction. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we observed aberrantly induced maturation dynamics and reduced oligodendrocyte lineage cell density at 12 months in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by increased MYRF expression. Interestingly, sustained MYRF overexpression was found to be toxic for oligodendrocytes in vitro. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that A{beta} exposure elevates MYRF protein levels and enhances its transcriptional activity, pointing to post-translational regulation. Mechanistically, A{beta} impaired GSK3-dependent phosphorylation and Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination of MYRF, prolonging N-MYRF stability, an effect prevented by PKC inhibition in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of PKC inhibitor Go6983 normalized MYRF levels, restored oligodendrocyte populations and myelin integrity, and improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice, with locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior remaining unaffected. Together, these findings identify MYRF dysregulation as a mechanistic link between A{beta}/PKC signaling and oligodendrocyte pathology, and highlight PKC inhibition as a potential strategy to restore oligodendroglial function and cognition in AD.",

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

(b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "Plasmalogen-Independent Neuroprotection: Synthetic alkyl ether lipids activate signaling to mitigate neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive function",
    "content": "Neuroinflammation is a key driver of neurodegenerative disorders, with chronic activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway contributing to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. In this study, we report that KIT-8, a synthetic alkyl ether lipid, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects despite its inability to be converted into plasmalogens within cells unlike its analog KIT-13, which is known to generate plasmalogens. Remarkably, KIT-8 activates key intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf') expression in Neuro2A cells, thereby mimicking the actions of both KIT-13 and natural plasmalogens. Furthermore, KIT-8 significantly improves memory function in mice, underscoring its inherent therapeutic potential. Importantly, the biological activity of KIT-8 suggests that plasmalogen synthesis is not required for its functional effects, introducing a novel concept in ether lipid biology. Supporting this notion, we identified additional alkyl ether lipid analogs, KIT-19 and KIT-20, which also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties despite lacking the ability to generate plasmalogens. These findings indicate that the ether bond structure alone may be sufficient to confer biological activity. To explore this further, we designed and synthesized a series of structurally distinct alkyl ether lipids (KIT compounds) retaining an ether bond at the sn-2 position. In an LPS-induced inflammatory model using mouse-derived microglial MG6 cells, selected compounds KIT-8, KIT-19, and KIT-20 significantly suppressed NF-{kappa}B signaling, reduced p65 nuclear translocation, and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta} and NOS2. Given the cognitive benefits associated with plasmalogens in Alzheimer's disease, our findings position alkyl ether lipids as promising standalone bioactive molecules, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuronal function independently of plasmalogen synthesis.",

    "title": "Automated assessment of tDCS electrode placement accuracy based on structural MRI",
    "content": "Purpose: Accurate electrode placement is essential for studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) since it determines whether - and to which extent - the intended brain region was modulated. Precise electrode placement also reduces between-subject variability. Using in-scanner tDCS, accuracy and precision of electrode placement can be determined. Previous studies manually segmented electrode positions from structural MRI, a process that is time-consuming and prone to error. We therefore developed an algorithm that automatedly extracts electrode coordinates from structural MRI. Methods: We applied this algorithm to 49 datasets acquired at different field strengths (3 T and 7 T), with two image resolutions and electrode montages (bifrontal or ring-shaped) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We validated its accuracy by comparing the automatedly extracted coordinates with manual annotations from two independent readers. We then used the actual and intended electrode coordinates to simulate how electrode placement deviations influenced the resulting electric field. Results: For all setups and scanners, the median localization error of the algorithm was 2.3 mm. It was within 1 mm of the variability between human readers (2.7 mm), indicating human-level reliability. Large deviations (> 20 mm) from intended positions led to substantial changes in the electric field - up to 35% for the ring-shaped montage - highlighting the need for placement verification in tDCS studies. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm obviates the need for manual electrode segmentation and allows an objective evaluation of electrode placement accuracy and precision for in-scanner tDCS. It may be used to relate electrode position errors to stimulation effects, thereby supporting reproducible tDCS research.",

    "content": "Circadian disruptions perturb the brain and immune system and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet whether this involves dysregulation of brain immunity remains less clear. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the brain immune compartment around the day-night cycle and identify brain border-associated macrophages (BAMs) as highly rhythmic cells. During the rest phase, we find that BAMs exhibit coordinated upregulation of endocytic genes and enhanced uptake of extracellular fluid-borne material including amyloid-beta. Rhythmicity in BAM scavenging is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1, mediated by the endocytic receptor CD206, and perturbed with age. In a mouse model of AD, we show that deletion of Bmal1 in BAMs worsens perivascular and leptomeningeal amyloid-beta plaque burden. Our results identify endocytosis as a specialized and rhythmic BAM function and identify perturbed timing of brain border immune functions as a potential mechanism by which circadian disruptions precipitate amyloidosis.",

    "title": "Systematic Errors in DC Offset Measurement and Mitigation at Neurostimulation Electrodes: Causes, Implications and Solutions",
    "content": "Objective: Neuromodulation therapies are becoming increasingly common as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders and deficits. Despite their widespread use, the frameworks used to evaluate device longevity and electrochemical safety are limited, producing variable results for platinum (Pt) electrodes across studies. In addition, next-generation neuromodulation electrodes like thin-film microelectrode arrays (TFMEAs) are more prone to failure by virtue of their smaller size, higher edge to bulk ratios, and greater sensitivity to electrochemical dissolution processes. Two potential contributors to the variability in reported electrochemical safety limits and device performance are particularly sensitive to scaling electrodes to smaller geometries, namely: 1) insufficient measurement device input impedance and 2) unmitigated stimulator leakage currents. Approach: To explore these effects, we first characterize the impact of electrode size (1.27 x 10-4 to 7.85 x 10-3 cm2) on apparent open circuit potential (VaOCP) and interpulse potential (VIPP) measurements at platinum electrodes across measurement instrumentation configurations. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used DC mitigation strategies, including stimulation with capacitive coupling (CC), and with capacitive coupling combined with cathode/anode shorting after each pulse (CC+ES), as a function of electrode size. Main Results: Without proper DC mitigation, insufficient measurement input impedance leads to an underestimation of DC offsets ({Delta}VIPP) and, consequently, overestimation of charge injection limit (Qinj) at Pt electrodes. In contrast, when DC offsets are properly mitigated and the input impedance of the measurement device is sufficient, the experimentally derived charge injection limits for Pt electrodes are larger than what has been reported historically. Significance: By identifying the instrumentation-related confounds biasing measurements of electrochemical safety limits, this work provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of Qinj for safety, as well as a framework for identifying and mitigating DC offset as a potential source of variability in electrophysiological findings across studies using TFMEAs.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p><a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">mkvDB</a> is a unified sync + async key-value store backed by PyMongo that provides a dead-simple and super tiny Redis-like API (<code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>remove</code>, etc). MongoDB handles concurrency so mkvDB is inherently safe across threads, processes, and ASGI workers.</p> <p>A long time ago I wrote a key-value store called pickleDB. Since its creation it has seen many changes in API and backend. Originally it used <code>pickle</code> to store things, had about 50 API methods, and was really crappy. Fast forward it is heavily simplified relies on <code>orjson</code>. It has great performance for single process/single threaded applications that run on a persistent file system. Well news flash to anyone living under a rock, most modern real world scenarios are NOT single threaded and use multiple worker processes. pickleDB and its limitations with a single file writer would never actually be suitable for this. Since most of my time is spent working with ASGI servers and frameworks (namely my own, <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/micropie\">MicroPie</a>, I wanted to create something with the same API pickleDB uses, but safe for ASGI. So mkvDB (MongoKeyValueDataBase) was born. Essentially its a very tiny API wrapper around PyMongo. It has some tricks (scary dark magic) up its sleave to provide a consistent API across sync and async applications.</p> <p>```</p> <h1>Sync context</h1> <p>db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # OK value = db.get(&quot;x&quot;) # OK</p> <h1>Async context</h1> <p>async def foo(): db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) await db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # must await value = await db.get(&quot;x&quot;) ```</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>mkvDB was made for lazy people. If you already know MongoDB you definitely do not need this wrapper. But if you know MongoDB are lazy like me and need to spin up a couple different micro apps weekly (that DO NOT need a complex product relational schema) then this API is super convenient. I don't know if ANYONE actually needs this, but I like the tiny API, and I'd assume a beginner would too (idk)? If PyMongo is already part of your stack, you can use mkvDB as a side car, not the main engine.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Nothing really directly competes with mkvDB (most likely for good reason lol). The API is based on <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/pickledb\">pickleDB</a>. <a href=\"https://dataset.readthedocs.io/\">DataSet</a> is also <em>sort</em> of like mkvDB but for SQL not Mongo.</p> <h3>Links and Other Stuff</h3> <p>Some useful links:</p> <ul> <li>Homepage: <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">https://patx.github.io/mkvdb</a></li> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/\">https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/</a></li> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/mkvdb\">https://github.com/patx/mkvdb</a></li> </ul> <p>Reporting Issues</p> <ul> <li>Please report any issues, bugs, or glaring mistakes I made on the Github issues page.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_Ear3789\"> /u/Miserable_Ear3789 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<p>Hey HN, Waleed here. We're building Sim (<a href=\"https://sim.ai/\">https://sim.ai/</a>), an open-source visual editor to build agentic workflows. Repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/simstudioai/sim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/simstudioai/sim/</a>. Docs here: <a href=\"https://docs.sim.ai\">https://docs.sim.ai</a>.<p>You can run Sim locally using Docker, with no execution limits or other restrictions.<p>We started building Sim almost a year ago after repeatedly troubleshooting why our agents failed in production. Code-first frameworks felt hard to debug because of implicit control flow, and workflow platforms added more overhead than they removed. We wanted granular control and easy observability without piecing everything together ourselves.<p>We launched Sim [1][2] as a drag-and-drop canvas around 6 months ago. Since then, we've added:<p>- 138 blocks: Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Supabase, SSH, TTS, SFTP, MongoDB, S3, Pinecone, ...<p>- Tool calling with granular control: forced, auto<p>- Agent memory: conversation memory with sliding window support (by last n messages or tokens)<p>- Trace spans: detailed logging and observability for nested workflows and tool calling<p>- Native RAG: upload documents, we chunk, embed with pgvector, and expose vector search to agents<p>- Workflow deployment versioning with rollbacks<p>- MCP support, Human-in-the-loop block<p>- Copilot to build workflows using natural language (just shipped a new version that also acts as a superagent and can call into any of your connected services directly, not just build workflows)<p>Under the hood, the workflow is a DAG with concurrent execution by default. Nodes run as soon as their dependencies (upstream blocks) are satisfied. Loops (for, forEach, while, do-while) and parallel fan-out/join are also first-class primitives.<p>Agent blocks are pass-through to the provider. You pick your model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, vLLM), and and we pass through prompts, tools, and response format directly to the provider API. We normalize response shapes for block interoperability, but we're not adding layers that obscure what's happening.<p>We're currently working on our own MCP server and the ability to deploy workflows as MCP servers. Would love to hear your thoughts and where we should take it next :)<p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43823096\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43823096</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052766\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052766</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Relative contribution of gonads and sex chromosomes to sex differences in cell-type gene expression in the mouse medial septum and sex-biased disease risk",
    "content": "Background While sex differences in the brain have traditionally been attributed to gonadal hormones, emerging evidence points to regulation by sex chromosomes. This study aims to differentiate the influence of gonads versus sex chromosomes on cellular gene expression in the mouse medial septum (MS), a critically understudied brain region. Methods Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing and the Sex Chromosome Trisomy mouse model, we (1) quantified sex differences in cellular gene expression and (2) isolated sex-biasing effects by identifying perturbed cell types, differentially expressed genes, biological pathways, and gene networks, which were integrated with GWAS data to explore links with sex-biased human phenotypes. Results Our analysis revealed that volumetric sex differences in the MS are mirrored by widespread transcriptomic changes across cell types. Critically, genetic effects displayed elevated relevance compared to sex hormones in driving sex-biased gene expression. These effects converge to regulate synaptic/neuronal development, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. Sex chromosome-associated DEGs were enriched for various human disorders, suggesting a cellular and mechanistic basis for their sex-biased patterns. Conclusions Our findings challenge the classical gonad-centric views of sexual differentiation, as the MS displays sex-biased transcriptional regulation driven by sex chromosome-associated effects that are highly relevant for human health.",

    "title": "Network Rerouting Under Ayahuasca: Temporally and Hemisphere-Resolved EEG Connectomics",
    "content": "Ayahuasca profoundly alters conscious experience, yet robust, time-resolved EEG markers of its network-level effects remain limited. We combined machine learning with complex-network analysis to quantify how functional connectivity reorganizes across time and hemispheres in resting-state EEG from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including three 5-min sessions: pre-dose (T1), 2 h post-dose (T2), and 4 h post-dose (T3). The cohort consisted of naive ayahuasca users, a population known to exhibit attenuated or more stable acute responses, making the detection of network-level changes particularly challenging. Connectivity was estimated using multiple metrics and sliding windows (10-120 s), and network features were computed and averaged to ensure statistical validity. A representation-selection step identified Spearman correlation and an intermediate temporal scale as optimal, with classification performance peaking at 60-70 s (independent-test AUC and accuracy = 0.93). Linear mixed models revealed a bilateral decrease in eigenvector centrality (weaker hub influence), increased degree heterogeneity in the right hemisphere, and reduced global efficiency in the left. Edge-level analyses localized these effects: Posterior-left connections weakened acutely (lowest at T2), whereas right temporal-central coupling transiently strengthened (highest at T2). Together, these convergent results support a mechanistic summary: as hub-centric shortcuts weaken, communication is increasingly routed through alternative, more distributed and less efficient pathways, with a right-lateralized expression at a later time. Methodologically, the window-optimized, hemisphere-resolved, and edge-validated pipeline extends prior EEG work and highlights temporal scale (approximately 60 s) as a biologically meaningful parameter for detecting psychedelic-induced network reorganization.",

    "title": "Therapeutic modulation of the calpastatin/calpain pathway restores calpain-mediated synaptic proteolysis and preserves motor neurons survival and function in C9orf72 ALS",
    "content": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in the C9orf72 gene is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS, with early neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction being a key pathological feature. Current therapies provide only limited symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for targeted, mechanism-based interventions. Using a C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model (C9-miR) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) motor neurons, we identified significant downregulation of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a calcium-dependent protease family implicated in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that restoring calpastatin function through calpain inhibition with calpeptin or a novel calpastatin-derived peptide ameliorates locomotor deficits and NMJ dysfunction in the C9-miR zebrafish model. These interventions enhance synaptic vesicle turnover and quantal release at the NMJ while improving motor neuron excitability and synaptic integrity in iPSC-derived motor neurons. N-terminomic/TAILS mass spectrometry approaches revealed direct calpain-mediated cleavage of synaptic proteins in motor neurons derived from C9orf72 patients. Proteolysis of key synaptic proteins, such as spectrin, is prevented by calpeptin and calpastatin peptide treatments. Our findings establish the calpastatin/calpain axis as a pivotal regulator of synaptic function in C9orf72-associated ALS and identify it as a promising therapeutic target, offering a novel strategy to restore synaptic transmission and potentially halt disease progression.",

    "title": "A stuttering-associated Gnptab variant alters fine-motor kinematics",
    "content": "Precise reach-to-grasp movements rely on complex cortico-basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, and can be affected by cellular pathway defects. We investigated whether mild Gnptab deficiency, affecting mannose-6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting, impairs fine motor behaviors in mice. Using the staircase test, high-frame-rate video, and markerless tracking, we assessed reaching and grasping in Gnptab-mutant and control littermates. Our data suggest that Gnptab-mutant mice retrieved about 75% fewer pellets than controls and exhibited abnormal grasping, characterized by increased wrist extension and larger digit angles, decreased digital velocity, and shorter reach distances, while elbow angles remained largely unchanged. These findings suggest a specific deficit in grasp shaping and trajectory control, rather than overall limb positioning. Our data establishes a quantitative link between GNPTAB-related lysosomal pathway disruption and fine-motor impairments, providing a valuable model for understanding how cellular dysfunction impacts motor circuit function.",

    "title": "The Research Landscape of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Parkinson's Disease: Systematic Review and Interactive Tool",
    "content": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has emerged as a powerful framework for characterizing the time-varying network disruptions underlying Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the rapid expansion of this field has introduced substantial methodological heterogeneity, creating a fragmented landscape that complicates knowledge synthesis and clinical translation. To address this, we performed a systematic review to map the conceptual and methodological diversity of dFC research in PD. Beyond a traditional static synthesis, we developed DynaPD, an open-source interactive application that allows researchers to dynamically explore study designs, analytical pipelines, and reported findings. Our synthesis of 37 eligible studies reveals a landscape defined by methodological contrast. While preprocessing strategies exhibited high variability (divergence), we observed a marked convergence on core analytical choices, specifically the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for parcellation and the sliding-window technique coupled with k-means clustering for state identification. Regarding empirical findings, a consensus emerged on the relevance of specific dynamic features - namely dwell time, fraction time, and number of transitions - yet clinical interpretations varied, particularly concerning the implications of strongly connected versus sparsely connected states. We further identified stated limitations across the studies, including a predominance of cross-sectional designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting standards. These findings highlight the urgent need for longitudinal studies with extended acquisition protocols and standardized reporting frameworks. By providing both a systematic evidence synthesis and a living interactive tool, this work aims to consolidate the diverse dFC literature, fostering a more coherent and cumulative path toward precision neurology in PD.",

    "title": "Analytical meditation improves physiological well-being in expert practitioners: a study on central and peripheral neurophysiological correlates",
    "content": "Meditation has been long associated with improvements in mental well-being, emotional regulation, and attentional control. Yet, the diversity of meditative techniques and participant expertise has hindered the systematic identification of their neurophysiological correlates supporting these benefits. To address this challenge, we investigated the neurophysiological signatures of concentrative and analytical meditation in 35 experienced Tibetan monk practitioners. EEG, ECG, EDA, and respiration were simultaneously recorded during Concentrative, Loving-Kindness and Emptiness meditations. Linear-mixed-models revealed significant modulations in autonomic and cortical activity across meditations. Peripheral indices indicated enhanced parasympathetic tone, decreases respiratory rate, and gradual increase in EDA - reflecting a state of relaxed-alertness with concurrent vagal engagement and sustained sympathetic arousal. EEG analyses supported this state showing elevated gamma-band power during analytical meditations. These findings suggest that advanced meditative states foster an adaptive integration of autonomic and cortical responses, supporting the emergence of relaxed-vigilance - a psychophysiological condition associated with well-being and cognitive flexibility.",

    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Disentangling motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations and their modulation with rTMS",
    "content": "Cortical beta oscillations are central to motor control. These rhythms are modulated during movement preparation and execution, and are also sensitive to cognitive factors such as uncertainty, attention and reward prediction. However, the distinct motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations-roles that may inform condition-specific therapeutic strategies-remain unclear. This study aimed to disentangle the respective contributions of motor and cognitive functions, and to assess their modulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twenty-four healthy participants performed a visually cued reaching task in which directional uncertainty was dynamically manipulated by varying the number of targets in real-time. Reaction time was quantified as a behavioural measure. Three stimulation conditions were applied during the preparatory periods between the 'uncertainty' and 'go' cues: no stimulation, regular rTMS at each participant's individual beta frequency, and irregular rTMS. Electroencephalography was used to measure beta-band oscillatory activity. Our results showed that 'uncertainty' cues induced bilateral beta suppression, with greater uncertainty linked to smaller reductions in beta power. Movement-related beta modulation was lateralised to the hemisphere contralateral to the executing hand, where elevated beta power in the pre-'go' cue period predicted longer reaction times. Both regular and irregular rTMS significantly shortened reaction times and attenuated beta event-related desynchronisation. Reductions in beta desynchronisation correlated with improvements in reaction times, suggesting beta desynchronisation reflects a neural threshold for movement initiation. These findings indicate that cortical beta oscillations encode distinct motor and cognitive processes, and that beta frequency rTMS can modulate beta dynamics to facilitate faster movement initiation by lowering this neural threshold.",

    "title": "Drosophila maintain a consistent navigational goal angle for days to weeks",
    "content": "Past work has demonstrated that Drosophila can keep to a consistent navigational bearing for minutes to hours. Here, we ask whether they can do so over days to weeks. First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks. Furthermore, the technology introduced here may enable trained behaviors across thousands of reinforcement trials in Drosophila, a paradigm central to mammalian neuroscience yet absent in flies.",

    "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
    "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

    "title": "Vascular Microbleeds Without Brain Atrophy: A Microvascular Signature of Mid-Stage 5xFAD Pathology",
    "content": "Cerebral microbleeds are increasingly recognized as a downstream manifestation of vascular injury in Alzheimer disease (AD), arising secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Here, we examined the pathological specificity of microbleeds by comparing an amyloidosis mouse model (5xFAD) with a small-vessel disease (SVD) model characterized by vascular smooth-muscle cell loss. In vivo multimodal MRI, including gradient-echo, spin-echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging, was complemented by ex vivo high-resolution anatomical scans for validation. Both in vivo and ex vivo gradient-echo MRI consistently revealed hippocampal microbleeds in the 5xFAD model without macroscopic atrophy or ventricular enlargement, whereas no microbleeds or blood-brain barrier disruption were detected in the SVD model. Diffusion-weighted MRI further showed region-specific alterations in apparent diffusion coefficient within the midbrain of 5xFAD mice, but not in other regions or in the SVD cohort. These findings indicate that microbleeds are a pathology-specific marker of amyloid-related vascular injury rather than a general indicator of small-vessel impairment. The combined imaging evidence underscores the potential of microbleeds as a disease-specific biomarker for detecting amyloid-driven vascular fragility and refining diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.",

    "content": "Parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) are disrupted across diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting their vulnerability to developmental perturbations. Inflammation can perturb PVI development and function, and inflammatory mechanisms are often propagated within the brain by microglia. Yet the microglial mechanisms linking inflammatory signals to interneuron development are unclear. To test the role of microglial innate immune signaling in PVI development, we used mice lacking toll-like receptor adaptor MyD88 specifically in microglia. MyD88-deficient microglia showed reduced inflammatory responses but increased early-life phagocytosis of inhibitory synaptic material. In adulthood, males without microglial MyD88 exhibited increased hippocampal PVI density, increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, increased inhibitory signaling, and impaired discrimination behaviors. We determined the cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, which normally drives adult microglial remodeling of the ECM, is developmentally regulated in the hippocampus. MyD88-deficient microglia fail to respond to IL-33, leading to reduced remodeling of the ECM component aggrecan. These results reveal microglial immune signaling via MyD88 regulates hippocampal inhibitory circuit development in a sex-specific manner.",

    "content": "Learned associations between environmental cues and reward drive motivated behavior, yet how specific cell types support this process remains unclear. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked dorsal medial prefrontal cortical astrocytes throughout the acquisition, expression, and reversal of Pavlovian sucrose conditioning. As learning progressed, astrocytes exhibited time-locked, spatially coordinated calcium signals that differentiated correct behavioral action from mistakes, evolving from broad outcome encoding to selective representation of responses associated with the reward-conditioned stimulus. Omission testing revealed that prefrontal astrocytes preferentially respond to the cue-reward association, rather than the conditioned stimulus or reward alone. When reward contingencies were reversed, astrocytic activity rapidly adapted to track the new cue-reward association and encode updated and outdated motivated behavioral actions. Finally, astrocytic ablation attenuated motivated behavior during initial associative learning and prevented persistence of conditioned reward seeking when reward contingencies were updated or unpredictable. These findings reveal prefrontal astrocytes are functionally plastic elements that regulate reward-seeking behavior across associative learning.",

    "title": "Susceptibility-matched padding improves the quality of cervical and lumbar spinal fMRI",
    "content": "Spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has advanced significantly in recent years, revealing insights into the function of somatosensory and motor systems. However, the complex environment of the spinal cord induces unique sources of noise, limiting the quality of spinal fMRI recordings. Various hardware and software solutions have been proposed to address these challenges. Among them, susceptibility-matched padding has gained popularity due its low cost, ease of use, and effectiveness in reducing static B0 field inhomogeneities, which are a major source of artefacts in spinal fMRI. Despite anecdotal evidence, the impact of susceptibility-matched padding on the quality of spinal cord fMRI has not been assessed systematically. We investigated the effects of non-protonated perfluorocarbon liquid-filled padding (SatPad) on B0 field homogeneity and functional echo-planar imaging (EPI) in cervical and lumbar spinal cord in 10 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent two resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, one per cord section. Within each session they were scanned with and without SatPad in a pseudo-randomised order. The use of SatPad increased B0 field homogeneity and improved functional image quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio, timeseries coefficient of variation, DVARS, and ghosting artefacts. While both cervical and lumbar cord data benefited from the use of SatPad, greater effects were observed in the cervical cord. These findings provide a compelling basis for integrating susceptibility-matched padding into routine spinal fMRI protocols.",

    "title": "PLD1-Dependent Regulation of Synaptic Integrity: Implications for Cognitive Resilience and Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis",
    "content": "Dysregulation of Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study investigated PLD1 signaling in synaptic integrity and cognition during aging and in a late-onset AD mouse model, hypothesizing differential effects of PLD1 modulation on synaptic vulnerability. AAV2-mediated gene transfer was employed to overexpress (PLD1 OXP) or attenuate (PLD1 ATT) PLD1 in aged wild-type (WT) and 3xTg-AD mice. To validate these constructs, differentiated PC12 cells were utilized. Within these cells, a model of post-mitotic neurons, PLD1 OXP exhibited a notable reduction in both the average neurite length and the percentage of neurite-bearing cells. This suggests that elevated PLD1 activity exerts a significant influence on neurite outgrowth. Conversely, PLD1 ATT did not inhibit neurite formation, indicating it is not detrimental at the cellular level. These cellular findings paralleled in vivo observations - electrophysiological studies revealed PLD1 OXP impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission, particularly in aged WT mice, whereas PLD1 ATT improved synaptic function in 3xTg-AD mice. Behaviorally, PLD1 ATT enhanced spatial working memory and reduced anxiety-like behavior, notably in 3xTg-AD mice. These results highlight that tight PLD1 regulation is vital for maintaining synaptic integrity and cognitive resilience. Thus, PLD1 attenuation may serve as an important complement to immunotherapeutic approaches by strengthening synaptic resilience in neurodysfunctional states, including AD and related dementia (ADRD).",

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Heat-shock pathway activation by TRC051384 protects spiral ganglion neurons from noise-induced hearing loss",
    "content": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major public health problem caused by damage to cochlear hair cells, synapses, and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Since effective treatments are lacking, we investigated cellular stress responses induced by moderate and loud noise in a mouse model of cochlear synaptopathy. RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed that noise exposure elicited a robust but transient upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and proteasome subunits in SGNs and their supporting cells. To target this response, we administered TRC051384, a small molecule activator of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1, prior to noise exposure. TRC051384 crossed the blood labyrinth barrier and reached the cochlea, induced heat shock protein gene expression, and restored ubiquitin proteasome function in SGNs. Notably, TRC051384 treatment enhanced auditory brainstem response threshold recovery, preserved Wave I amplitudes, and maintained ribbon synapse density. These findings establish proteotoxic stress in SGNs as a key driver of NIHL and identify HSF1 activation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

    "title": "Reevaluating the classification of pediatric speech sound disorders: a ground truthing perspective",
    "content": "Pediatric Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs) are conventionally diagnosed using auditory-perceptual assessments, heavily relying on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions. This approach, while prevalent, is increasingly criticized due to inherent perceptual biases, limited sensitivity to subtle speech motor variations, and insufficient reflection of underlying speech mechanisms. This paper critically re-examines a widely used diagnostic classification system for pediatric SSDs, namely Dodd\u2019s Model of Differential Diagnosis (MDD), emphasizing the limitations of perceptual methods and advocating for instrumental techniques to address significant ground truthing issues. Critical analysis in this paper integrates evidence from perceptual research, instrumental phonetics, and speech motor development studies, highlighting discrepancies between traditional classification methods and modern instrumental data. Findings indicate profound limitations in current auditory-perceptual classification methods, particularly regarding their inability to detect subtle motoric impairments such as jaw sliding, covert motor contrasts, and undifferentiated tongue gestures. Evidence from instrumental studies supports a speech-motor rather than purely cognitive-linguistic basis for many pediatric SSDs, revealing significant inadequacies in current clinical practices. To avoid the narrow interpretation of \u201cmotor speech\u201d as referring only to childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or dysarthria, we explicitly broaden its scope to include a wider range of motoric influences on SSDs. Given these critical ground truthing concerns, the paper proposes adopting instrumental-based methodologies that offer greater precision in identifying underlying motor-based impairments, thereby promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of pediatric SSDs. Furthermore, the discussion advocates for adopting a dimensional rather than categorical classification framework, emphasizing gradual developmental trajectories and foundational speech motor skills. Aligning with modern precision medicine principles, the proposed approach aims to refine diagnostic accuracy, improve intervention effectiveness, and ultimately enhance clinical outcomes for children with SSDs.",

    "content": "Due to the intricate dynamic coupling between molecular networks and brain regions, early diagnosis and pathological mechanism analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain highly challenging. To address this, we propose a graph convolutional neural network framework (DEG-BRIN-GCN) based on a differentially expressed gene-brain region interaction network (DEG-BRIN), aiming to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and biological interpretability in AD research. We began by systematically analyzing transcriptomic data from 19 brain regions, identifying 329 differentially expressed genes that display widespread co-expression across multiple regions. Using these findings, we constructed DEG-BRIN to model prior associations among genes, thereby revealing potential molecular connectivity patterns implicated in AD pathological progression. Leveraging this network prior, we developed an AD classification model based on graph convolutional networks. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our proposed DEG-BRIN-GCN achieves significantly better diagnostic performance than three categories of baseline models: traditional machine learning methods, Random-GCN (models based on random network topologies), and PPI-GCN. Further analysis identified key brain regions\u2013such as the superior parietal lobule, putamen, and frontal pole\u2013along with high-contribution genes, including VCAM1, MCTP1, HBB, and CX3CR1, which play critical roles in AD pathology. Notably, this study is the first to implement a interpretability analysis based on a \u201cgene-region-pathway\u201d triad, offering a novel framework for cross-scale exploration of AD pathological mechanisms. Our findings underscore the central importance of inter-regional molecular interaction networks in the accurate diagnosis of AD.",

    "content": "Neuropathic pain is commonly accompanied by hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, which is driven by regulation of several ion channels, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) that stabilize the resting membrane potential. The TWIK-Related Spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, K2p18.1) is predominantly expressed in sensory ganglia, where it provides major background K+ conductance. We describe a heterozygous c.1107del frameshift mutation in KCNK18, encoding TRESK, found in a patient with painful small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia. This C-terminal c.1107del mutant is predicted to generate an elongated C-terminal domain, with an altered protein sequence. Whole-cell patch calmp recordings showed that the c.1107del variant reduced K+ current density, while heterozygous-like expression resulted in intermediate currents, consistent with a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Confocal imaging revealed decreased plasma membrane expression, indicating a trafficking-dependent loss of function while oligomerization with TRESK (homomeric channels) or TREK1 remained intact. In silico analysis revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern and reduced C-terminal hydrophobicity in the mutant TRESK. Overall, these findings support c.1107del as a pathogenic KCNK18 variant causing TRESK haploinsufficiency, offering mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) induces profound circadian disruption\u2014characterized by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) degeneration, A\u03b2 and tau pathology, and aberrant melatonin secretion which results in fragmented sleep\u2013wake cycles and cognitive decline. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise significantly ameliorates these circadian rhythm and sleep\u2013wake disturbances through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, exercise accelerates the removal of A\u03b2 and tau by activating autophagy\u2013lysosomal degradation and glymphatic clearance, thereby reducing the neuropathological burden. Furthermore, exercise also upregulates neuroprotective pathways and strengthens the amplitude and phase stability of core clock gene oscillations, which in turn restores robust melatonin rhythmicity and SCN function. Collectively, these effects break the vicious cycle between AD pathology and circadian disruption, stabilizing circadian homeostasis and improving cognitive function. These mechanistic insights highlight exercise as a robust non-pharmacological chronotherapeutic strategy for ameliorating circadian disruption in AD. These insights support the development of personalized, chronotype-tailored exercise interventions to resynchronize circadian rhythms and ultimately improve sleep quality and cognitive function in patients with AD.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08942v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Junior indie game developers in distributed, part-time teams lack production frameworks suited to their specific context, as traditional methodologies are often inaccessible. This study introduces the CIGDI (Co-Intelligence Game Development Ideation) Framework, an alternative approach for integrating AI tools to address persistent challenges of technical debt, coordination, and burnout.\n  The framework emerged from a three-month reflective practice and autoethnographic study of a three-person distributed team developing the 2D narrative game \"The Worm's Memoirs\". Based on analysis of development data (N=157 Jira tasks, N=333 GitHub commits, N=13+ Miro boards, N=8 reflection sessions), CIGDI is proposed as a seven-stage iterative process structured around human-in-the-loop decision points (Priority Criteria and Timeboxing).\n  While AI support democratized knowledge access and reduced cognitive load, our analysis identified a significant challenge: \"comprehension debt.\" We define this as a novel form of technical debt where AI helps teams build systems more sophisticated than their independent skill level can create or maintain. This paradox (possessing functional systems the team incompletely understands) creates fragility and AI dependency, distinct from traditional code quality debt.\n  This work contributes a practical production framework for resource-constrained teams and identifies critical questions about whether AI assistance constitutes a learning ladder or a dependency trap for developer skill.",

The framework enables real-time, personalized urban evaluation based on individual priorities and lifestyle requirements. The methodology employs grid-based discretization and a two-stage computational architecture that separates intensive preprocessing from lightweight real-time calculations. The computational architecture demonstrates that accessibility modelling can be made accessible to non-technical users through interactive interfaces, enabling fine-grained spatial analysis and identification of accessibility variations within neighbourhoods. The research contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 11's vision of inclusive, sustainable cities by providing tools for understanding how different populations experience identical urban spaces, supporting evidence-based policy development that addresses accessibility gaps.",

The application utilizes the OCEAN model to understand the user's personality traits and make customized suggestions to enhance their well-being. The proposed application focus on improving the user's mood rather than just detecting their emotions. Preliminary results of the model are presented, showing the potential of the application in predicting the user's mood and providing personalized recommendations. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of such an application for various societal segments, including doctors, individuals, and mental health organizations, in improving emotional well-being and reducing the negative impact of mental health issues on daily life.",

    "title": "Assessing the Human-Likeness of LLM-Driven Digital Twins in Simulating Health Care System Trust",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.08939v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Serving as an emerging and powerful tool, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Human Digital Twins are showing great potential in healthcare system research. However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08938v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be effectively integrated into Strategic Technology Management (STM) practices to enhance the strategic alignment and effectiveness of technology investments. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative survey data (n=230) and qualitative expert interviews (n=14), this study addresses three critical research questions: what success factors AI innovates for STM roadmap formulation under uncertainty; what resources and capabilities organizations require for AI-enhanced STM; and how human-AI interaction should be designed for complex STM tasks. The findings reveal that AI fundamentally transforms STM through data-driven strategic alignment and continuous adaptation, while success depends on cultivating proprietary data ecosystems, specialized human talent, and robust governance capabilities. The study introduces the AI-based Strategic Technology Management (AIbSTM) conceptual framework, which synthesizes technical capabilities with human and organizational dimensions across three layers: strategic alignment, resource-based view, and human-AI interaction. Contrary to visions of autonomous AI leadership, the research demonstrates that the most viable trajectory is human-centric augmentation, where AI serves as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment. This work contributes to theory by extending the Resource-Based View to AI contexts and addressing cognitive and socio-technical chasms in AI adoption, while offering practitioners a prescriptive framework for navigating AI integration in strategic technology management.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08937v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Seeking advice is a core human behavior that the Internet has reinvented twice: first through forums and Q\\&amp;A communities that crowdsource public guidance, and now through large language models (LLMs) that deliver private, on-demand counsel at scale. Yet the quality of this synthesized LLM advice remains unclear. How does it compare, not only against arbitrary human comments, but against the wisdom of the online crowd? We conducted two studies (N = 210) in which experts compared top-voted Reddit advice with LLM-generated advice. LLMs ranked significantly higher overall and on effectiveness, warmth, and willingness to seek advice again. GPT-4o beat GPT-5 on all metrics except sycophancy, suggesting that benchmark gains need not improve advice-giving. In our second study, we examined how human and algorithmic advice could be combined, and found that human advice can be unobtrusively polished to compete with AI-generated comments. Finally, to surface user expectations, we ran an exploratory survey with undergraduates (N=148) that revealed heterogeneous, persona-dependent preferences for agent qualities (e.g., coach-like: goal-focused structure; friend-like: warmth and humor). We conclude with design implications for advice-giving agents and ecosystems blending AI, crowd input, and expert oversight.",

First, the development of the Fitbit Insights explorer, a large language model (LLM)-powered system designed to help users interpret their personal health data, is described. Subsequently, the safety, helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and personalization (SHARP) principle-based framework is introduced as an end-to-end operational methodology that integrates comprehensive evaluation techniques including human evaluation by generalists and clinical specialists, autorater assessments, and adversarial testing, into an iterative development lifecycle. Through the application of this framework to the Fitbit Insights explorer in a staged deployment involving over 13,000 consented users, challenges not apparent during initial testing were systematically identified. This process guided targeted improvements to the system and demonstrated the necessity of combining isolated technical evaluations with real-world user feedback. Finally, a comprehensive, actionable approach is established for the responsible development and deployment of LLM-powered health applications, providing a standardized methodology to foster innovation while ensuring emerging technologies are safe, effective, and trustworthy for users.",

    "title": "From Script to Stage: Automating Experimental Design for Social Simulations with LLMs",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.08935v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for social science research. Multi-agent simulations powered by LLMs are increasingly becoming a vital approach for exploring complex social phenomena and testing theoretical hypotheses. However, traditional computational experiments often rely heavily on interdisciplinary expertise, involve complex operations, and present high barriers to entry. While LLM-driven agents show great potential for automating experimental design, their reliability and scientific rigor remain insufficient for widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated multi-agent experiment design framework based on script generation, inspired by the concept of the Decision Theater. The experimental design process is divided into three stages: (1) Script Generation - a Screenwriter Agent drafts candidate experimental scripts; (2) Script Finalization - a Director Agent evaluates and selects the final script; (3) Actor Generation - an Actor Factory creates actor agents capable of performing on the experimental \"stage\" according to the finalized script. Extensive experiment conducted across multiple social science experimental scenarios demonstrate that the generated actor agents can perform according to the designed scripts and reproduce outcomes consistent with real-world situations. This framework not only lowers the barriers to experimental design in social science but also provides a novel decision-support tool for policy-making and research.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08934v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-assisted gait analysis holds promise for improving Parkinson's Disease (PD) care, but current clinical dashboards lack transparency and offer no meaningful way for clinicians to interrogate or contest AI decisions. To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08933v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly embedded in collaborative learning environments, yet their impact on the processes of argumentative knowledge construction remains insufficiently understood. Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2511.02241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.09524v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding. Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/NeuroSketch.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.09366v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \\textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.09351v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Influential models of primate visual cortex describe two functionally distinct pathways: a ventral pathway for object recognition and the dorsal pathway for spatial and action processing. However, recent human and non-human primate research suggests the existence of a third visual pathway projecting from early visual cortex through the motion-selective area V5/MT into the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here we integrate anatomical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence demonstrating that this pathway specializes in processing dynamic social cues such as facial expressions, eye gaze, and body movements. This third pathway supports social perception by computing the actions and intentions of other people. These findings enhance our understanding of visual cortical organization and highlight the STS's critical role in social cognition, suggesting that visual processing encompasses a dedicated neural circuit for interpreting socially relevant motion and behavior.",

    "content": "Photoreceptors gate and shape visual information. Since perception ultimately guides action, the way photoreceptors transform light into neural signals constrains an animal's behavioural repertoire. Yet, the physiological role of the highly conserved calcium-dependent chloride current in cone photoreceptors has remained elusive. Whereas calcium-activated currents typically provide negative feedback, we identify a counter-intuitive positive feedback mechanism that enhances detection of slow motion. Using genetics, electrophysiology, and behavioural assays in zebrafish, we show that loss of this current exaggerates the biphasic character of cone impulse responses and diminishes their voltage response amplitude to low temporal frequencies (<1 Hz). These changes in photoreceptor properties translate to behaviour, reducing the gain of the optokinetic response to slow-moving stimuli. Mechanistically, the calcium-dependent chloride current acts as a positive feedback loop that sustains the photovoltage response and counteracts strong adaptation within the cone phototransduction cascade.",

    "title": "Gene Therapy for Efficient Suppression of T-Type Channels in Treating Diabetic Neuropathy",
    "content": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a chronic and often incurable syndrome, is one of the most common and unpleasant complications of diabetes. Effective clinical interventions for PDN are very limited and already developed approaches are characterized by lack of molecular or cellular target specificity and a short duration of therapeutic effects. Numerous investigations causally link upregulation of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels in peripheral nociceptive neurons to painful symptoms of PDN. Here we suggest an approach to alleviate these symptoms based on implementation of virus-mediated cell-specific delivery of vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Processed by Dicer into specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), they would suppress the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels. In order to experimentally validate this approach, we have initially confirmed the ability of designed Dicer-substrate small interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs) to suppress expression of T-type channels in neurons of primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Target sequences of the effectively interfering DsiRNA were then used to design shRNAs and the coding sequences of shRNAs were cloned into the vector pAAV under U6 promotor. This plasmid was also proved to be effective in interference with expression of the T-type channels in the rat cultured DRG neurons. The expression cassette of this plasmid will be packed into AAV6 particles with tropism to unmyelinated fibers to suppress T-type channel expression in nociceptive DRG neurons and to alleviate painful symptoms of PDN.",

    "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single gene that severely affects motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is ultimately fatal. While disruptions in the structural integrity of the striatum are well documented, less is known about how the underlying functional impairments relate to the disease. We developed a large-scale modeling framework based on intrinsic ignition to uncover functional anomalies during HD progression. We first measured how much a spontaneous event in one brain region influences the rest of the brain, then systematically perturbed the activity of the striatum to predict the empirical changes in functional connectivity (FC) by re-optimizing the model parameters and conducting in-silico experiments. Results showed that disruption of the activity dynamics in the caudate, and to some extent the putamen, are the key factors that explain a substantial amount of the variance in FC alterations during HD progression. We then assessed the ability to recover whole-brain functional activity by driving the caudate and putamen activity towards a healthy-like regime and found that, by tuning the local bifurcation parameter of caudate and putamen, it is possible to recover whole-brain healthy functional activity, albeit moderately. Surprisingly, although the functional disruptions in the caudate better explained the alterations in FC, the recovery of the dynamics was more effective in the putamen. Overall, our results suggest that the disruptions of the dynamics in the striatum can explain the gross functional connectivity changes in HD. Our study demonstrates that computational modeling is an important tool to reveal the underlying patterns behind the observed data and provides an opportunity to test interventional mechanisms in silico.",

    "title": "ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations promote fragility of genes governing excitatory neurotransmission via topoisomerase II\u03b2 impairment",
    "content": "Abnormal TAR DNA/RNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization, aggregation, and pathogenic mutations. Altered excitatory neuronal transmission is an early functional defect in these diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neuronal activity can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting a potential link between altered excitability and genomic instability. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TDP-43 is involved in neuronal activity-induced DSBs. Moreover, we show that ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations (A90V and A315T) disrupt this mechanism, leading to the accumulation of DSBs and altered neuronal activity compared to wild-type TDP-43 protein. Using the BLISS technique, we mapped genome-wide DSBs in primary mouse neurons expressing wild-type or mutant (A90V, A315T) TDP-43 and found enrichment of DSBs within genes regulating excitatory transmission. Mechanistically, the TDP-43 A90V mutation impairs topoisomerase II{beta} function, resulting in enzyme trapping and/or DNA supercoiling that predisposes DNA to breaks. Notably, this impairment is partially rescued by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) overexpression. These findings uncover a novel mechanism linking aberrant neuronal activity and DNA damage, bridging two key pathological hallmarks of ALS/FTD associated with TDP-43 dysfunction. It also paves the way for developing novel therapeutic approaches that rely on targeted DSB repair and/or modulating topoisomerase II{beta}-DNA complexes.",

    "title": "Effective connectivity reveals a shift to left-hemisphere dominance for spatial attention with diminishing arousal",
    "content": "In healthy righthanders, spatial attention typically becomes biased to the right side when alertness wanes. The underlying neural mechanisms of healthy spatial attention and these drowsiness-related spatial biases remain contested. Competing theories propose that attention is governed either by the interaction of two bilateral networks (dual-network model) or by a dominant right hemisphere (right hemisphere dominance model). To adjudicate between these models, we investigated how effective connectivity within the auditory cortical hierarchy is modulated by drowsiness. We recorded high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) in 32 healthy participants performing a lateralised auditory localisation task in both awake and drowsy states. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis revealed that arousal states become decodable approximately 150 ms post-stimulus. We used Parametric Empirical Bayes and Dynamic Causal Modelling to map arousal-dependent changes in effective connectivity between left-sided and right-sided auditory stimuli. Consistent with the right hemisphere dominance model of spatial attention, right-sided stimuli elicited stronger bidirectional information flow between bilateral inferior frontal gyri during wakefulness. However, we observed a significant reduction in right-hemispheric frontoparietal connectivity alongside a strengthening of a left-hemispheric pathway from the inferior parietal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus during drowsiness. This finding supports the dual-network theory and conflicts with the right hemisphere theory's prediction of a bilateral decrease in activity during drowsiness. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how diminishing arousal shifts cortical processing from a bilaterally integrated network to a left-lateralised state. Our results therefore support the dual-network model of spatial attention while retaining elements of the right hemisphere model.",

    "title": "Attentional focus and emotion modulate voice recognition deficits in cerebellar stroke patients",
    "content": "The cerebellum, long regarded as a motor structure, is increasingly recognized for its role in higher-order cognitive and socio-emotional functions. Its contribution to vocal emotion decoding, however, remains insufficiently understood. While prior work has linked the cerebellum to attentional control and predictive coding, direct evidence for its role in modulating prosody recognition under explicit versus implicit attentional demands is lacking. This study investigated how cerebellar stroke, controlled for time since stroke in months, and with an equal number of left- and right-lateralized lesions, alters vocal emotion processing depending on attentional focus. We aimed to disentangle sensory encoding and integration from decisional contributions of the cerebellum by combining behavioral analyses, drift diffusion modeling (DDM), and functional MRI in cerebellar stroke. Fifteen patients with chronic, isolated cerebellar stroke and fifteen matched controls performed two tasks on vocal stimuli expressing anger, happiness, or neutrality. In the explicit task, participants categorized the expressed emotion; in the implicit task, they categorized speaker gender while ignoring emotional tone. Behavioral performance was analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression and DDM (angle model). Functional MRI analyses included conventional contrasts as well as model-based regressors derived from behavioral and computational parameters. Patients showed lower accuracy than controls, with deficits particularly pronounced in the explicit task. Performance also varied by emotion: gender recognition for angry voices (implicit processing) was relatively preserved, whereas happy and neutral voices were more vulnerable. Contrary to predictions, DDM parameters did not differ between groups. Instead, task effects dominated: implicit processing yielded higher drift rates, larger boundary separation, faster non-decision times, and stronger attentional focus compared to explicit recognition, suggesting that explicit evaluation imposes additional cognitive costs. At the neural level, patients recruited extended networks during explicit processing, including orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior insula, and cerebellar lobule IX, alongside cerebello-cortical tracts. Implicit processing was associated with more restricted activations, particularly in frontal opercular and cerebellar regions (lobule IX). Model-based analyses further revealed that successful categorization in patients relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and pre-supplementary motor area, although these effects were not significant when controlling for time since stroke. Our findings demonstrate that the cerebellum does not primarily shape decision dynamics but optimizes sensory representations of prosodic cues for downstream evaluation. When predictive tuning is compromised, patients maintain intact decision processes yet rely on compensatory cortical recruitment, particularly during explicit tasks. This pattern supports predictive coding accounts of cerebellar function in socio-emotional communication and highlights the need to consider subtle socio-affective deficits in cerebellar patients.",

There are other newcomers (I listed some <a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/embar?tab=readme-ov-file#other-orms-to-consider\">here</a>) but none of them are very type-safe.</p> <h1>What my project does</h1> <p>This is a Python ORM I've been slowly working on over the last couple of weeks.</p> <h1>Target audience</h1> <p>This might be interesting to you if:</p> <ul> <li>Type-safety is important to you</li> <li>You like an ORM (or query builder) that maps closely to SQL</li> <li>You want async support</li> <li>You <em>don't</em> like &quot;Active Record&quot; objects. Embar returns plain dumb objects. Want to update them? Construct another query and run it.</li> <li>You like <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview\">Drizzle</a> (this will never be as type-safe as Drizzle, as Python's type system simply isn't as powerful)</li> </ul> <p>Currently it supports sqlite3, as well as Postgres (using psycopg3, both sync and async supported). It would be quite easy to support other databases or clients.</p> <p>It uses Pydantic for validation (though it could be made pluggable) and is built with the FastAPI ecosystem/vibe/use-case in mind.</p> <h1>Why am I posting this</h1> <p>I'm looking for feedback on whether the hivemind thinks this is worth pursuing! It's very early days, and there are many missing features, but for 95% of CRUD I already find this much easier to use than SQLAlchemy. Feedback from &quot;friends and family&quot; has been encouraging, but hard to know whether this is a valuable effort!</p> <p>I'm also looking for advice on a few big interface decisions. Specifically:</p> <ol> <li>Right now, <code>update</code> queries require additional <code>TypedDict</code> models, so each table basically has to be defined twice (once for the schema, again for typed updates). The only (?) obvious way around this is to have a codegen CLI that creates the <code>TypedDict</code> models from the Table definitions.</li> <li>Drizzle also has a &quot;query&quot; interface, which makes common CRUD queries very simple. Like Prisma's interface, if that's familiar. Eg <code>result = db.users.findMany(where=Eq(user.id, &quot;1&quot;))</code>. This would also require codegen. Basically... how resistant should I be to adding codegen?!?</li> <li>Is it worth adding a migration diffing engine (lots of work, hard to get exactly right) or should I just push people towards something like sqldef/sqitch?</li> </ol> <p>Have a look, it already works very well, is fully documented and thoroughly tested.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ol> <li>Type-safe. I looked at SQLAlchemy, PonyORM, PugSQL, TortoiseORM, Piccolo, ormar. All of them frequently allow <code>Any</code> to be passed. Many have cases where they return dicts instead of typed objects.</li> <li>Simple. Very subjective. But if you know SQL, you should be able to cobble together an Embar query without looking at the docs (and maybe some help from your LSP).</li> <li>Performant. N+1 is not possible: Embar creates a single SQL query for each query you write.

    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Morphometric Latent Factors in Autism and Their Association with Receptor Profiles and Behavior",
    "content": "The profound heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a major barrier to developing targeted therapies. While dimensional subtyping using functional connectivity (FC) has advanced the field, the intrinsic instability of FC limits its power to identify stable trait-like biomarkers. This study provides a direct comparison of latent factors derived from both FC and a stable morphometric measure, Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND), within the same ASD cohort. We hypothesized that stable structural factors would provide a more behaviorally relevant and biologically grounded account of ASD heterogeneity. Our findings reveal an important dissociation between functional and morphometric features. Latent factors derived from morphometric similarity (MIND) significantly correlated with core ASD behavioral traits (SCQ, SRS), while functional factors showed no association. This dissociation was also found at the neural level. Specifically, we observed weaker structure-function correspondence in the ASD group compared to the healthy control group (HC). Moreover, the stable structural factors were linked to trait-like neurodevelopmental mechanisms: the association with the CB1 receptor (important for synaptic pruning) observed in the HC was notably missing in the ASD group. Conversely, the functional factors were associated with a state-like arousal system (the norepinephrine transporter, NET). Collectively, our results demonstrate that stable morphometric-based factors, rather than time-varying functional ones, are predictive of behavioral traits in ASD.

    "title": "Traumatic Conditioning Induces a Combination of Anesthesia Resistant Memory and Protein Synthesis Dependent Long-Term Memory in Adult Drosophila",
    "content": "Stressful experiences elicit long-lasting memory trace that often persists for life-time. Though storage of experience dependent memory is key to survival, post-traumatic memories are detrimental to the physical and emotional wellbeing. The generation of any form of long-term memory culminates from synaptic plasticity and potentiation through persistent change in protein synthesis. Drosophila has been a robust model for the study of memory mechanisms; olfactory memory paradigms have been enormously successful in elucidating neuroanatomical, molecular, physiological and signalling pathways underlying the process. Long-term memory (LTM) has been induced by protein synthesis dependent mechanisms followed by a post-learning consolidation process whereas a medium-term anaesthesia resistant memory (ARM) is mediated by the Radish protein in flies. Here we present a novel and simple memory paradigm in adult flies for inducing sustained stress-induced memory paradigm, where a single attractive odorant is associated with an aversive stimulus- copper sulfate, which provides bitter taste as well as sustained malaise due to toxicity. We find that the elicited memory is a combination of ARM and LTM which is dependent on the number of training cycles. The eight-cycle training paradigm leads to robust, CREB and protein synthesis dependent memory persisting for about 7 days. The mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells neurons as well as the dopaminergic input neurons (PPL1 subset) are involved in the formation of memory mediated by enhanced calcium as well as synaptic elaboration in the {gamma} subset of the MB neurons.",

    "content": "Epilepsy often becomes treatment-resistant, partly due to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Enhancing inhibitory neuron activity via gene therapy may restore excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We developed a compact 410-bp glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter (cmGAD67) that enables strong, selective transgene expression in inhibitory neurons while preserving AAV packaging capacity. When delivered systemically, AAV vectors carrying cmGAD67 preferentially targeted parvalbumin interneurons and supported effective circuit manipulation. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) under cmGAD67 (AAV-GAD65) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) epilepsy models. Systemic AAV-GAD65 suppressed abnormal delta oscillations, reduced seizure-like events, normalized anxiety-like behavior, and improved survival in a severe PTZ paradigm. Biochemical analyses confirmed increased cortical and hippocampal GABA levels, linking behavioral and electrophysiological improvements to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis. Prior clinical evidence indicates that AAV-GAD65 delivery to the subthalamic nucleus is safe and effective in Parkinson's disease. Building on this foundation, our findings establish the cmGAD67 promoter as a powerful platform for inhibitory neuron-targeted AAV gene therapy and highlight AAV-cmGAD67-GAD65 as a promising approach for treatment-resistant epilepsy and other disorders involving disrupted E/I balance.",

    "title": "Normative modeling of brain morphology reveals neuroanatomical heterogeneity and biological subtypes in major depressive disorder",
    "content": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by high neurobiological heterogeneity, which hinders precise diagnosis and treatment. Traditional group-level neuroimaging analyses fail to capture individual differences, while normative modeling offer a promising approach to quantify individual deviations from healthy brain structure patterns, facilitating the identification of biological subtypes and offering a data-driven framework to dissect this heterogeneity. METHODS: Using 1,190 healthy controls (age 22-37), we constructed normative developmental trajectories of gray matter volume (GMV) across 246 Brainnetomedefined regions using Bayesian linear regression. Deviation maps were derived for 398 MDD patients. k-means clustering was employed to identify GMV-based biotypes. Then, the clinical characteristics and anatomical differences among these subtypes were explored, along with the post-treatment clinical features and treatment responses of participants who completed the 8-week antidepressant treatment within each subtype. RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited widespread yet individually variable GMV deviations. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes: Subtype 1 displayed predominantly negative deviations in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, whereas Subtype 2 showed widespread positive deviations in temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Subtype 1 had higher extraversion and symptom-linked deviation patterns; in Subtype 2, deviation burden correlated with generalized anxiety. Longitudinally, Subtype 1's GMV deviation changes predicted symptom improvement, while Subtype 2's deviations correlated with baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS: Normative modeling of GMV reveals marked neuroanatomical heterogeneity in MDD and identifies subtypes with distinct clinical and treatment-related characteristics, laying a foundation for precision psychiatry and individualized interventions.",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Semantic reasoning takes place largely outside the language network",
    "content": "The brain's language network is often implicated in the representation and manipulation of abstract semantic knowledge. However, this view is inconsistent with a large body of evidence suggesting that language processing is neurally distinct from the rest of cognition. Here, we use precision brain imaging to uncover a set of brain regions, separate from the language network, that are engaged in semantic processing of both linguistic and pictorial stimuli. In three fMRI experiments, participants (total n=41 tested across 49 sessions) viewed sentences and pictures depicting simple events. In separate blocks, they performed either a semantic task or a difficulty-matched perceptual task. Across all three experiments, several areas in left lateral prefrontal cortex, left temporo-parietal cortex, and right cerebellum responded to semantic tasks for both sentences and pictures. These semantic processing areas are spatially and functionally distinct from the nearby language-selective areas, as well as from the multiple demand and default mode networks, exhibiting a unique response profile. Our results provide evidence for a new kind of selectivity in the human brain and pave the way for future explorations of the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic reasoning.",

    "title": "Gait transition mechanism from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion in the Japanese macaque based on inverted pendulum",
    "content": "The ability of non-human primates to transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion offers critical insights into both the evolution of human bipedalism and the principles of complex motor control. While quadrupedal and bipedal gaits in non-human primates have been studied, the dynamic mechanisms underlying the transition between these gaits remain poorly understood. Japanese macaques trained to walk bipedally have been reported to utilize inverted pendulum dynamics to achieve efficient bipedal locomotion. Given the intrinsic instability of inverted pendulum systems, which can induce large changes in movement with minimal control input, we hypothesized that this mechanism also contributes to the gait transition. To test this, we developed a neuromusculoskeletal model of the Japanese macaque that integrates a detailed musculoskeletal structure with a physiologically inspired motor control system. Through forward dynamics simulations, we generated a variety of movement patterns by systematically parameterizing motor commands, including failed transitions that are difficult to capture experimentally. We then applied dynamical systems analysis using on an inverted pendulum model to examine the underlying principles of the transition process. Our results demonstrate that successful gait transitions depend on generating an inverted pendulum motion through appropriate control of the forward step length of one hindlimb. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how Japanese macaques coordinate their complex musculoskeletal systems to perform skilled, full-body movements in the gait transition, offering a deeper understanding of both advanced motor control and the evolution of human bipedalism.",

    "title": "Diminished spatial dynamics and maladaptive spatial complexity link resting brain network disruption to cognition in schizophrenia",
    "content": "Resting-state fMRI studies increasingly emphasize the dynamic nature of brain networks. While most approaches examine temporal fluctuations in connectivity, we focus on the spatial dynamics and complexity at voxel level - how networks expand and contract, and change their structural complexity over time. Using dynamic independent component analysis (ICA), we investigate the hierarchical structure of the resulting time-varying spatial networks, from their broad periphery to their most active core. We combine this with fractal dimension (FrD) as a measure of a network's spatial complexity and analyze temporal changes (dynamic flexibility) in a network and synchronized fluctuations between network pairs (fractal dimension coupling, FrDC). We refer to this approach as 'dynamic spatial network complexity and connectivity (dSNCC)'. Using a combined cohort of 508 subjects (315 healthy controls, 193 schizophrenia patients), we found that schizophrenia is associated with higher mean FrD in several networks, suggesting more irregular patterns/boundaries and a disorganized network structure. Critically, patients showed significantly reduced dynamic flexibility, indicating their networks are 'stuck' in a less adaptable state. This robust finding is evidenced by a synergistic loss of temporal standard deviations in both network volume and FrD across multiple networks and activity thresholds. This maladaptive complexity was associated with cognitive impairment, with several dSNCC measures showing significant associations with subject scores for processing speed, visual learning, and verbal learning. Higher complexity in these networks and more significantly, their reduced dynamic flexibility as seen in patients, were particularly associated with impaired performance. Furthermore, we found aberrant connectivity (FrDC) in schizophrenia, with certain network pairs exhibiting overly synchronized complexity changes. Our results demonstrate that dSNCC is a powerful tool for characterizing network dynamics and may potentially provide a measurable mechanism for maladaptation in schizophrenia, where the brain's inability to fluidly change its complexity may contribute to cognitive deficits and symptoms like disorganized thought. These findings highlight the importance of studying the intrinsic spatial dynamic properties to reveal the fundamental principles of brain network organization in health and disease. Our work represents a significant leap in complex systems neuroscience and provides a novel, quantifiable biomarker framework highly relevant for understanding and targeting other complex disorders characterized by network dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, or other mental health conditions.",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
    "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "The protein interactome of the Neuron Specific Gene family (NSG1-3)",
    "content": "The Neuron-Specific Gene (NSG) family members (NSG1-3) play critical and diverse roles in neuronal protein trafficking, but their precise molecular functions remain poorly understood. Here, we employed proximity-labeling proteomics to map the interactomes of each NSG protein. Unlabeled mass spectrometry identified over 1,000 significantly enriched interactors compared with a cytoplasmic control, revealing substantial overlap between NSG1 and NSG2, and a more divergent profile for NSG3. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis confirmed established associations with glutamatergic synapses and endosomal trafficking, while also uncovering unexpected links to presynaptic machinery, inhibitory synapses, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein translation, particularly for NSG3. Reciprocal biotinylation patterns and co-immunoprecipitation revealed novel heteromeric complex formation between NSG1 and NSG2, with limited interactions involving NSG3. All three NSGs biotinylated core AMPA receptor subunits and auxiliary proteins, while NSG1 and NSG2 also associated with NMDA receptors, GABA receptor subunits, as well as multiple presynaptic proteins. Moreover, NSG1 and NSG2 specifically biotinylated components of multiunit tethering complexes including neuron-specific retromer, and biotinylated a preponderance of ADAM10 substrates, reinforcing their role in proteolytic processing. Finally, despite the relatively divergent interactomes of NSG1 and NSG2 compared to NSG3, all family members robustly biotinylated amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting possible synergistic or competitive interactions that could shape APP proteolytic processing and/or trafficking. Together, these data provide a comprehensive systems-level view of NSG protein interactions, establishing a molecular framework for future investigations into NSG-mediated neural plasticity and disease mechanisms.",

    "content": "We propose the existence of a sub-population of border ownership neurons that signal figure side along equiluminant borders, those defined purely by color contrast. We postulate that these neurons, similar to primate equiluminant V1 [26] and V4 [5] cells, are strongly activated by equiluminant contrast on their preferred side, with diminished response for strictly luminance contrast. To test this hypothesis, we propose a hierarchical and mechanistic model that explains how equiluminant border ownership signals can be achieved in the ventral stream. Our simulation results suggest that model equiluminant neurons are highly color-selective while exhibiting similar orientation and border ownership selectivity as their luminance counterparts. Additionally, our model equiluminant cells indeed exhibited the above postulated pattern of responses. We suggest that these neurons are the missing links in the equiluminance channels in the ventral stream that transform equiluminant oriented edge signals in V1 to equiluminant object-centered shape representations in V4. Our findings point to the importance of re-examining the border ownership neuron population to further detail their role in equiluminant channels in the ventral stream.",

    "title": "NMDA receptor ablation in medial prefrontal cortex disrupts value updating and reward history integration",
    "content": "Schizophrenia, a serious mental illness, is associated with evidence of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction and characterized by cognitive impairments that reflect impaired value updating and feedback-driven control; however the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying these disruptions remain unclear. Here we test how NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contributes to adaptive decision-making by combining targeted genetic ablation in mice and systemic pharmacology. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to eliminate the obligate GluN1 subunit, we induced spatially confined NMDAR hypofunction in mPFC and compared its effects to systemic pharmacological blockade with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 during performance of a touchscreen-based restless bandit task. Prefrontal NMDAR ablation impaired value discrimination, weakened the use of negative feedback, and reduced mutual information between recent outcomes and current choices, indicating disrupted reward-history integration. Reinforcement-learning models incorporating a choice-kernel term best captured behavior and revealed that NMDAR ablation selectively dampened learning and choice-history parameters governing flexible updating. Systemic MK-801 produced broad impairments in control animals, reducing accuracy, mutual information, and outcome sensitivity, yet exerted only modest additional effects after NMDAR ablation, suggesting that prefrontal NMDAR loss occluded much of the pharmacological disruption. Simulations using fitted RLCK parameters reproduced these patterns, showing convergent flattening of choice dynamics under MK-801 and persistent deficits in GluN1 ablated animals. Together, these findings demonstrate that prefrontal NMDAR signaling is necessary for effective value updating and feedback-driven learning, and that its loss recapitulates core features of systemic NMDAR hypofunction. This work establishes a mechanistic bridge between localized cortical glutamatergic dysfunction and the reinforcement-learning disturbances characteristic of schizophrenia.",

    "title": "Divalent cation depletion enhances neuronal excitability through CaSR-dependent modulation of threshold channels",
    "content": "External calcium ([Ca2+]e) and magnesium ([Mg2+]e) concentrations fluctuate across physiological and pathological brain states. For example, [Ca2+]e; decreases during intense neuronal activity and epilepsy, whereas it rises during sleep. Similarly, [Mg2+]e; varies with the sleep/wake cycle and is reduced in epilepsy. Lowering either [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e increases intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the action potential (AP) threshold, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we confirm that reducing [Ca2+]e or [Mg2+]e enhances intrinsic excitability and hyperpolarizes the AP threshold of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Physiological reductions in [Mg2+]e (0.8 to 0.4 mM) have minimal effect, whereas decreases from supraphysiological levels (2.0 to 0.4 mM) robustly increase excitability. Using pharmacology and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identify the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) as a key mediator of these effects. The calcilytic NPS-2143 mimics and largely occludes both the intrinsic excitability increase and the AP-threshold hyperpolarization, while genetic reduction of CaSR produces similar outcomes. We further show that AP-threshold hyperpolarization induced by low divalent cations involves both Kv1 and Nav1.2 channels. Together, these findings reveal CaSR as a critical link between external divalent cation levels and intrinsic neuronal excitability through the modulation of Kv1 and Nav channels.",

    "content": "The mechanisms supporting concrete object concepts remain elusive. Here, macaque monkeys spent years learning object-concept primitives defined by color and shape. During fMRI, the monkeys held in mind one concept feature cued by the other. Using a whole-brain searchlight, we observed cross-feature decoding not in retinotopic cortex, but bilaterally in anterior inferior temporal cortex (aIT), temporal pole (TP), and frontal cortex (FC). Only TP and aIT had response patterns to concept shapes matching color-space geometry, and only PF had responses that decode behavioral errors. Two additional imaging experiments showed that color-associated versus non-color-associated shapes, and color-shape combinations congruent versus incongruent with the concepts, were distinguished only by extrastriate visual cortex, suggesting extrastriate cortex underpins color perception and perceptual feature binding. Together, the results provide a blueprint for how the brain generates stable object concepts and provides hypotheses for how conceptual representations engage perceptual representations through selective feedback during vision.",

    "title": "Restoring Amyloid Clearance via Astrocytes: Z17 Is a Selective Inhibitor of CHI3L1 in Alzheimers Disease",
    "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, accumulation of hallmark protein aggregates and substantial neuroinflammation. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) which is predominantly produced by activated astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Overexpression of CHI3L1 has been implicated with AD progression and worsening of symptoms. Herein, we report the identification of Z17 as a novel and selective CHI3L1 inhibitor which directly bind to CHI3L1 an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 6.0 M. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, Z17 acted as a dual-action regulator by reinstating astrocytic function and suppressing inflammation. Additionally, Z17 rescued CHI3L1-induced impairment by dose-dependently restoring A{beta} uptake and normalizing lysosomal proteolytic activity and pH. Furthermore, Z17 effectively blocked CHI3L1-driven activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in human astrocytes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the functional rescue. The in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of Z17 demonstrated favorable drug-like properties for CNS development. These findings support the advancement of Z17 as a selective CHI3L1 inhibitor capable of simultaneously mitigating neuroinflammation and restoring astrocytic clearance mechanisms, making it a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Alzheimers disease.",

    "content": "Background: Amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau pathology are key molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet how their interaction contributes to cognitive decline remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between Ab burden, tau pathology, presynaptic density, and spatial learning and memory in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic (TG) mouse model of amyloidosis. Methods: Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Barnes maze test in male TG and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, aged 6, 12, and 18 months. Gross visual function was assessed indirectly in 18-month-old animals using the light/dark exploration test. Brains were collected for autoradiography of tau pathology and presynaptic density with [18F]Flortaucipir and [3H]UCB-J, respectively, while Ab plaque load was measured by immunohistochemistry. Correlation and linear mixed-effects regression analyses were used to assess relationships between behavioral and pathological measures. Results: APP/PS1 mice showed normal cognitive performance at 6 months, a selective long-term memory deficit at 12 months, and severe impairments in learning and retention at 18 months, independent of visual confounds. Age-dependent increases in [18F]Flortaucipir binding and Ab plaque load were observed in all brain regions of TG compared to WT mice, whereas [3H]UCB-J binding was increased in a region-dependent manner in 18-month-old TG vs. WT animals. Barnes maze performance during the final day of testing correlated negatively with both Ab and tau pathology across all areas examined. Linear regression revealed a significant association between tau and age and between tau and Ab in the cortex, indicating that memory decline in ageing TG mice was driven by the combined effects of these pathologies. Conclusions: Deficits in memory retention precede impairments in task learning performance in APP/PS1 mice. Spontaneous tau accumulation contributes to the progressive cognitive decline, capturing key aspects of the Ab-tau interaction observed in human AD.",

    "content": "The pupillary light response was once considered a brainstem reflex, but newer findings indicate that pupil dilation can also reflect content held 'in mind' with working memory (WM). This suggests that WM may recruit even the earliest sensorimotor apparatus for maintenance. Here, we tested two boundaries of this pupillary WM response: whether it generalizes beyond low-level stimuli and whether it adapts to changing behavioral goals. Namely, we tested whether the pupils reflect remembered brightness for realworld scene images, and whether the effect varies when different features dimensions are emphasized for the memory test (i.e., visual detail vs. semantic category). We found a feature-specific pupillary WM effect for remembering natural scenes, but only when the task encouraged a visual maintenance strategy. Rather than a retrospective echo of sensory-evoked stimulus features, the pupillary WM response prospectively adapts to how the memory content will be used.",

    "title": "The Psychedelic Psilocin Suppresses Activity of Central Amygdala Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 Neurons and Decreases Ethanol Drinking in Female Mice",
    "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>",

    "title": "Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories",
    "content": "<p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>",

    "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity to Visual Sequences in Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reflects Familiarity",
    "content": "<p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity (\"sequence plasticity\") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that \"sequence plasticity\" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>",

The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions.

    "title": "Behavioral Relevance of Early Neural Coding of Low-Level Odor Features in Humans",
    "content": "<p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>",

    "title": "Aperiodic Activity Reflects Pathologic Waveform Shapes in Focal Epilepsy",
    "content": "<p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<i><sup></sup></i> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>",

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

Something with vectors as first-class citizens. Something that's more forgiving if you need a for-loop, or you're not familiar with vector semantics. So I wrote Serif. </p> <p>This is an early release (0.1.1), so don't expect perfection, but the core semantics are in place. I'm mainly looking for reactions to how the design feels, and for people to point out missing features or bugs.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Serif is a lightweight vector and table library built around ergonomics and Python-native behavior. Vectors are first-class citizens, tables are simple collections of named columns, and you can use vectorized expressions or ordinary loops depending on what reads best. The goal is to keep the API small, predictable, and comfortable.</p> <p>Serif makes a strategic choice: clarity and workflow ergonomics over raw speed.</p> <pre><code>pip install serif </code></pre> <p>Because it's zero dependency, in a fresh environment:</p> <pre><code>pip freeze # serif==0.1.1 </code></pre> <p><strong>Sample Usage</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a short example that shows the basics of working with Serif: clean column names, natural vector expressions, and a simple way to add derived columns:</p> <pre><code>from serif import Table # Create a table with automatic column name sanitization t = Table({ &quot;price ($)&quot;: [10, 20, 30], &quot;quantity&quot;: [4, 5, 6] }) # Add calculated columns with dict syntax t &gt;&gt;= {'total': t.price * t.quantity} t &gt;&gt;= {'tax': t.total * 0.1} t # 'price ($)' quantity total tax # .price .quantity .total .tax # [int] [int] [int] [float] # 10 4 40 4.0 # 20 5 100 10.0 # 30 6 180 18.0 # # 3\u00d74 table &lt;mixed&gt; </code></pre> <p>I also built in a mechanism to discover and access columns interactively via tab completion:</p> <pre><code>from serif import read_csv t = read_csv(&quot;sales.csv&quot;) # Messy column names? No problem. # Discover columns interactively (no print needed!) # t. + [TAB] \u2192 shows all sanitized column names # t.pr + [TAB] \u2192 t.price # t.qua + [TAB] \u2192 t.quantity # Compose expressions naturally total = t.price * t.quantity # Add derived columns t &gt;&gt;= {'total': total} # Inspect (original names preserved in display!) t # 'price ($)' 'quantity' 'total' # .price .quantity .total # 10 4 40 # 20 5 100 # 30 6 180 # # 3\u00d73 table &lt;int&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>People working with \u201cExcel-scale\u201d data (tens of thousands to a few million rows) who want a cleaner, more Pythonic workflow. It's also a good fit for environments that require zero or near-zero dependencies (embedded systems, serverless functions, etc.)</p> <p>This is not aimed at workloads that need to iterate over tens of millions of rows.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Serif is not designed to compete with high-performance engines like pandas or polars. Its focus is clarity and ergonomics, not raw speed. </p> <p><strong>Project</strong></p> <p>Full README and examples <a href=\"https://github.com/CIG-GitHub/serif\">https://github.com/CIG-GitHub/serif</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAerius\"> /u/TheAerius </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj5wdb/introducing_serif_a_zerodependency_vectorfirst/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj5wdb/introducing_serif_a_zerodependency_vectorfirst/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Launch HN: InspectMind (YC W24) \u2013 AI agent for reviewing construction drawings",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Aakash and Shuangling of InspectMind (<a href=\"https://www.inspectmind.ai/\">https://www.inspectmind.ai/</a>), an AI \u201cplan checker\u201d that finds issues in construction drawings, details, and specs.<p>Construction drawings quietly go out with lots of errors: dimension conflicts, co-ordination gaps, material mismatches,  missing details and more. These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.<p>Here\u2019s a video with some examples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ</a>.<p>Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues don\u2019t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10\u2013100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.<p>We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500\u20132000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.<p>We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!<p>You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that don\u2019t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanical/architectural elements; - Fire/safety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that don\u2019t exist.<p>The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We don\u2019t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.<p>Construction drawings aren't standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier \u201cautomated checking\u201d tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, we\u2019re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!<p>We\u2019re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. There\u2019s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so we\u2019re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldn\u2019t be done with previous tools.<p>Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. It\u2019s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. We\u2019re open to feedback on that too, we\u2019re still figuring it out.<p>If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  we\u2019d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, what\u2019s useful, and what\u2019s missing!<p>We\u2019ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong. Thanks for reading! We\u2019re happy to answer anything and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "title": "Chronic semaglutide treatment enhances the incentive motivational value of a small food reward and associated cue in male and female rats",
    "content": "Rationale: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, are increasingly utilized in clinical practice due to their efficacy in promoting sustained weight loss following chronic administration. While acute treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been shown to suppress food intake and reward-seeking behaviors in rodent models, the impact of prolonged exposure on preclinical measures of motivated behavior remains insufficiently characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of chronic administration of semaglutide on both the acquisition and expression phases of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA), a behavioral paradigm used to assess the attribution of incentive salience to a food-paired cue. The influence of chronic semaglutide on the conditioned reinforcing properties of the food-associated cue, performance on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for food reward, and ad libitum consumption of the food reward were also assessed. Results: Chronic semaglutide administration did not significantly alter either the acquisition or the expression of PavCA behavior. However, relative to vehicle-treated controls, semaglutide markedly enhanced responding for the food-associated cue during a conditioned reinforcement test and increased PR responding for the food reward. In contrast, semaglutide reduced both free consumption of the food reward and homecage chow intake. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that chronic semaglutide administration potentiates the incentive value of food-paired cues and increases motivation for food reward under restricted access conditions, yet attenuates overall food consumption when food is freely available. This dissociation highlights the nuanced effects of semaglutide on motivated behavior and suggests an amplification of the reinforcing properties of discrete, limited food rewards and associated cues.",

    "title": "Neuromuscular Signals Shape Fatigue and Effort-Based Decision-Making in Humans",
    "content": "Physical fatigue influences our willingness to undertake effortful actions, yet the physiological signals driving this process are not well understood. We created a biofeedback paradigm to distinguish the effects of reduced muscle-force capacity from compensatory increases in neuromuscular activity on effort-based decision-making. Human participants made risky choices about prospective physical effort before and after repeated fatiguing exertions under two biofeedback conditions: force biofeedback, which required increased neuromuscular drive, and EMG biofeedback, which constrained the increase in neuromuscular drive. Both biofeedback conditions led to similar reductions in muscle strength and feelings of fatigue. Using computational modeling of choice behavior, however, we found that the Force biofeedback condition, which required compensatory neuromuscular activation, caused a significantly greater increase in the subjective cost of effort than EMG biofeedback. By combining neuromuscular manipulation with computational modeling, our study demonstrates how various physiological processes affect feelings of fatigue and decisions to exert effort in response to fatiguing exertions. These results suggest that fatigue may consist of separate components that collectively serve to motivate behavior while simultaneously protecting and restoring bodily homeostasis amid physical challenge.",

    "title": "Oxytocin enhances excitability and potentiates synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus granule cells",
    "content": "The dentate gyrus is the principal gateway for information into the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus transforms input from the entorhinal cortex into sparse, selective representations that support memory formation. Oxytocin is a key neuromodulator of social behavior and supports social memory through its actions in hippocampal area CA2. However, whether oxytocin also modulates the dentate gyrus (DG), a source of major excitatory input to CA2, remains unclear. We performed whole-cell recordings to test if oxytocin modulated the excitability of mouse dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that bath application of the oxytocin receptor agonist Thy4, Gly7-oxytocin (TGOT) increased DG granule cell excitability by depolarizing the resting membrane potential, increasing input resistance, and hyperpolarizing action potential threshold. In addition to increasing postsynaptic excitability, we found that TGOT decreased the paired-pulse ratio of perforant path to granule cell synapses and also increased the frequency, without an effect on amplitude, of miniature EPSCs suggesting that TGOT increased the probability of glutamate release. Notably, long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst pairing occluded the effect of TGOT on synaptic strength suggesting that oxytocin and long-term potentiation may converge on common downstream mechanisms. Our results revealed a previously uncharacterized role for oxytocin in regulating the relay of information between the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus. This suggests a potential mechanism through which oxytocin shapes hippocampal processing of socially relevant stimuli.",

In this study, we investigated associations between microstructural metrics derived from the Standard Model (SMI) in white matter (WM) and the Standard Model with EXchange (SMEX/NEXI) in gray matter (GM) with two MT measures differing in specificity and sensitivity to myelination: the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) and the inhomogeneous magnetization transfer ratio (ihMTR). Measurements were performed in WM and GM in ten healthy subjects scanned at 3T. In WM, the strongest significant association was observed between ihMTR and the axonal water fraction, consistent with higher myelination in regions of elevated axonal density and limited extra-axonal space. This correlation exceeded that of MPF, supporting the greater specificity of ihMTR to myelin. Interestingly, ihMTR displayed a gradient along the longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum, in agreement with previous histology measurements. Correlation between ihMTR and the extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity (De{perp}), a putative myelination biomarker, was not significant, whereas MPF and De{perp} exhibited a moderate significant positive correlation. Since a negative correlation is expected if reflecting myelination, these results suggest that in healthy tissue De{perp} is mainly influenced by microstructural factors like fiber coherence and packing, the latter most likely affecting MPF but not ihMTR. In GM, ihMTR correlated significantly only with the exchange time (t), confirming tex as a proxy for cell membrane permeability modulated by myelin. MPF correlated exclusively with the cell-process fraction (f), suggesting the latter is modulated by total (neuronal and glial) cell membrane density. Overall, findings underscore the complementary and concurring microstructural information captured by these metrics, highlighting their potential to disentangle distinct tissue mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. Future studies incorporating ground-truth histology should validate the precise sensitivity of each metric to various microstructural tissue features.",

    "title": "Investigation of CNS damage following HIV infection and methamphetamine exposure using human iPSC-derived microglia and 3D cerebral assembloid models",
    "content": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is characterized by glial activation and neuroinflammation emerging from HIV infection. Moreover, methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant whose use is linked to high HIV prevalence, significantly worsening clinical outcomes for people living with HIV and hastening onset of systemic illness. Overall, pathologies associated with HIV infection/METH use comorbidity include neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, synaptodendritic damage, and resulting cognitive dysfunction. However, mechanisms underlying this neuropathogenesis remain elusive due to the scarcity of human brain-specific experimental model systems. Therefore, we created a next-generation three-dimensional (3D) human brain model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Specifically, this 3D in vitro cerebral assembloid model integrates functional microglia derived from hiPSCs with cerebral organoids. Microglia are key contributors to HAND symptoms associated with HIV/METH comorbidity. We show that the presence of microglia in this assembloid model allows productive infection with HIV, which is enhanced by METH exposure, resulting in increased glial activation, inflammatory responses (namely IL-1{beta} and IL-6 release), and neurotoxicity marked by neuronal cell death and synaptic protein loss. Importantly, in this model, we observed markedly decreased levels of the microglial receptor TREM2, which is implicated in microglial functions including phagocytosis, apoptosis and inflammatory responses following HIV infection and METH treatment. Analysis of our model showed that decreased TREM2 function may lead to HIV- and METH-associated pathological changes. Overall, our assembloid model could be a valuable tool for future analyses of HIV/METH/CNS interactions and mechanisms underlying HAND, which could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to decreasing the CNS viral reservoir.",

    "title": "A transient feature of the inferior olive supports thedevelopment of cerebellar internal models",
    "content": "The inferior olive (IO) supports motor learning by supplying the cerebellum with critical sensory and motor input. In adult rats, that input includes externally generated limb stimulation. In contrast, the IO of postnatal day 8 (P8) rats does not exhibit responses to external stimuli. Instead, IO activity primarily reflects corollary discharges associated with the production of self-generated limb twitches during active (REM) sleep. Because corollary discharges are necessary for the computation of internal models, we tested the hypothesis that IO-related corollary discharge is necessary for the emergence of a functioning cerebellar internal model during development. First, by conducting extracellular recordings in the IO at P12 and P20, we confirmed the presence of twitch-related corollary discharge at both ages; however, whereas the IO at P20 responded to limb stimulation, the IO at P12 did not. Next, using a protocol for selectively lesioning the climbing fibers that connect the IO to the cerebellum, including the interpositus nucleus (IP), we confirmed that lesioning at P12 prevents the IP's expression of corollary discharge at P13. Finally, we assessed the necessity of IO input to the cerebellum for the emergence of an internal model by lesioning climbing fibers at P12 or P19 and testing for the expression of a cerebellar internal model in the thalamus at P20. Only when the lesions occurred at P12 was the expression of the internal model severely disrupted. These findings provide the most direct evidence to date linking twitch-related corollary discharge to the developmental emergence of a cerebellar-dependent internal model.",

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Aakash and Shuangling of InspectMind (<a href=\"https://www.inspectmind.ai/\">https://www.inspectmind.ai/</a>), an AI \u201cplan checker\u201d that finds issues in construction drawings, details, and specs.<p>Construction drawings quietly go out with lots of errors: dimension conflicts, co-ordination gaps, material mismatches,  missing details and more. These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.<p>Here\u2019s a video with some examples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ</a>.<p>Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues don\u2019t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10\u2013100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.<p>We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500\u20132000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.<p>We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!<p>You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that don\u2019t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanical/architectural elements; - Fire/safety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that don\u2019t exist.<p>The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We don\u2019t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.<p>Construction drawings aren't standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier \u201cautomated checking\u201d tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, we\u2019re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!<p>We\u2019re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. There\u2019s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so we\u2019re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldn\u2019t be done with previous tools.<p>Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. It\u2019s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. We\u2019re open to feedback on that too, we\u2019re still figuring it out.<p>If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  we\u2019d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, what\u2019s useful, and what\u2019s missing!<p>We\u2019ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong. Thanks for reading! We\u2019re happy to answer anything and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Higher glucose levels buffer against everyday stress load",
    "content": "Adaptive stress responses are dependent on the availability of energy and the body's effectiveness in metabolizing glucose as fuel. However, it is not well understood if glucose levels contribute to the functional regulation of daily stress in healthy individuals. Here, we used 4307 ratings of stress during a four-week period of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with concurrent recordings from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in 91 participants (47 women). In accordance with the hypothesized metabolic link, we found that higher glucose levels were associated with lower self-reported stress (b = -.038, p = .035, controlling for mood). Crucially, dynamic changes in glucose levels also precipitated subsequent increases in stress levels (0-2h before EMA: p = .013; incremental effect 10-12h before: p < .001), with lower glucose levels associated with subsequent stress increases and elevated glucose with stress relief, highlighting the potential of monitoring physiological biosensor data to improve adaptive stress regulation. We conclude that metabolic signals, such as glucose, play an important role in channeling stress responsiveness in healthy adults, pointing to a pivotal avenue for improved interventions to avoid excessive stress experiences.",

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Neuronal PARIS-STAT3 axis drives tau pathology and glial activation in Alzheimers disease",
    "content": "PARIS, a substrate of Parkin, accumulates in Parkinsons disease and promotes disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that PARIS also contributes to Alzheimers disease by elevating STAT3 transcriptional activity, thereby inducing tau pathology, hippocampal atrophy, and glial activation. Genetic depletion of Paris reduced tau phosphorylation and cognitive decline in tauopathy mice, whereas neuron-specific PARIS overexpression caused tau accumulation, gliosis, and memory impairment. In contrast, astrocyte-specific overexpression did not induce pathology, indicating that PARIS acts in neurons to drive tau phosphorylation and glial activation. The pathological features induced by neuronal PARIS overexpression were rescued by STAT3 inhibition, demonstrating that PARIS and STAT3 signaling underlies these effects. Moreover, Paris knockout did not alter pathology in the amyloid-driven mouse model, highlighting specificity for tau pathology. Together, these findings reveal PARIS as a neuronal regulator of STAT3 signaling that exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration and identify the PARIS and STAT3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimers disease.",

    "title": "Forward-projected cortical eigenmodes provide an efficient sensor-space representation of resting-state EEG",
    "content": "Sensor-space EEG analyses typically rely on electrode layouts or data-driven components and rarely encode cortical geometry, which makes scalp patterns difficult to link to anatomy and to compare across participants. We introduce a sensor-space basis dictionary that explicitly incorporates cortical geometry. Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenmodes are computed on a standard cortical template (fsaverage) and mapped through the lead-field matrix of a three-layer boundary-element head model to yield cortex-anchored sensor-space harmonics. This leadfield-mapped LB dictionary spans scalp topographies while preserving a meaningful spatial-frequency ordering inherited from the cortical manifold. We assess representational efficiency using ordinary least squares projections of resting EEG (eyes closed and eyes open) across 59-, 32-, and 19-channel montages, and compare against spherical harmonics (SPH), principal components (PCA), and independent components (ICA). Efficiency is quantified by the variance explained (R-squared) by the leading K modes, and by two efficiency indices, K70 and K90, defined as the smallest number of modes needed to reach at least 70% and 90% of the variance. Reliability is quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3,1) for eyes-open versus eyes-closed coefficients. The cortex-anchored basis shows higher early-K variance explained (R-squared) than SPH and PCA (for example, in 59-channel eyes-closed data at the number of modes K = 4, LB achieves an R-squared of about 0.56 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.59], compared with SPH about 0.44 [0.42, 0.46] and PCA about 0.08 [0.07, 0.09]) and reaches 70% and 90% variance with fewer modes (LB K70 about 8.6 versus SPH 12.3, PCA 19.3, ICA 22.8; LB K90 about 22.6 versus SPH 25.3, PCA 23.2, ICA 30.2). Mode-wise coefficient reliability is comparable between LB and SPH. By combining cortical eigenmodes with a forward head model, this approach provides a geometry-aligned, interpretable representation of sensor-space EEG that offers superior fidelity-complexity trade-offs at small K and a principled scaffold for low-dimensional EEG sensor-space analysis.",

    "title": "Critical spatial separation at the scale of V1 receptive fields determines motion segmentation",
    "content": "Integrating elements that belong to a single object while segregating overlapping objects is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, exemplified by the phenomenon of motion transparency. While the middle temporal (MT) cortex is central to motion processing, the role of V1 in motion transparency remains controversial. It is still unclear at what spatial scale segmentation for motion transparency occurs. To address these questions, we conducted human psychophysics experiments using locally paired-dot stimuli moving in two directions separated by 90{degrees}. Subjects performed a 3AFC task to report whether the visual stimulus had no motion, a single direction, or two distinct directions. We systematically manipulated the path length of the dots, and therefore, the spatial separation between the paired dots, and the retinal eccentricity of the visual stimulus. We found that as the spatial separation between the paired dots increased, subjects perception shifted from a single direction to two distinct directions. Critically, we found that the spatial separation required for this perceptual transition increased with the eccentricity and closely matched the known receptive field sizes of V1 neurons at those eccentricities. Direction segmentation occurred only when the spatial separation between motion components exceeded the V1 receptive field size. Conversely, direction integration occurred when the spatial separation was smaller than the V1 receptive field size. Our results demonstrate that the receptive field size of V1 neurons sets the critical spatial scale for direction segmentation and suggest that V1 plays a key role in motion transparency and, more generally, in motion segmentation.",

    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "The n-back task has become a central paradigm for investigating the mechanisms of working memory (WM) and related executive functions. This review provides an integrative analysis of the n-back experiment, covering its cognitive operations, task variants, neuroimaging findings, and practical applications across multiple domains. We first delineate three core cognitive components\u2014updating, maintenance, and attentional control\u2014and summarize converging evidence that these functions rely on overlapping fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal networks. We then examine major task variants and review applications in: (1) cognitive training and transfer effects, particularly the proposed association between WM and fluid intelligence; (2) clinical contexts including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and neurological rehabilitation; (3) developmental and educational settings; and (4) emerging research on social cognition, stress, and emotional regulation. Critically, this review evaluates ongoing inconsistencies in how the n-back task is interpreted as a measure of WM and highlights methodological factors, such as task heterogeneity, multi-process interference, and mental fatigue, that complicate both behavioral and neural inferences. To address these issues, we outline methodological recommendations including adaptive task design, multimodal physiological monitoring, and standardized experimental protocols. We further discuss future directions involving virtual reality (VR), mobile platforms, and brain-computer interface (BCI) integration to improve ecological validity and translational relevance. By synthesizing behavioral and neural evidence, this review underscores the n-back task\u2019s versatility while emphasizing the need for improved construct clarity and methodological rigor.",

    "content": "In many circuit models of neural computation, synaptic connections between neurons are organized according to their tuning to the variables being processed. The connectivities of canonical neural network models of head direction, spatial navigation, and orientation selectivity obey this principle and contain symmetries related to the angular and spatial variables they operate on. We develop a graph embedding algorithm to identify such symmetries. The algorithm segregates structure related to cell type from that related to the symmetries we seek to identify, distinguishing it from standard embedding methods. Our method successfully identifies rotational and translational symmetries in heading direction and visual projection neuron circuits using a connectome of the adult {\\em Drosophila} brain, and it also identifies a toroidal symmetry in a synthetic connectome of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. Such embedding geometries reveal the latent variables that are processed by a neural circuit and which cell types are responsible for this computation.",

These patients were randomly divided into a training group (108 cases, 70%) and a validation group (47 cases, 30%). Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis were conducted on the training group to identify risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after surgery. A predictive model was established using R software and validated.ResultsAfter conducting Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, factors influencing the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma were identified as follows: elevated preoperative prolactin levels, higher preoperative suprasellar cistern height, and hyponatremia in the first 1\u20132\u202fdays after surgery. The area under the ROC curve for forecasting delayed postoperative hyponatremia (DPH) in training and validation sets was 0.943 and 0.959, respectively. The DCA curve indicated a higher benefit in clinical application.ConclusionThe risk prediction model for delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma, developed in this study, demonstrates favorable predictive performance. The nomogram can be utilized for early identification of high-risk individuals for DPH.",

    "content": "BackgroundHigh-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that offers increased spatial precision compared to conventional tDCS. As its use has expanded across research and clinical settings, there has been increasing interest in understanding its safety and tolerability.ObjectiveThis review summarizes adverse events related to HD-tDCS in both healthy and clinical populations, focusing on how stimulation intensity, session frequency, and polarity influence tolerability.ResultsIn healthy populations, HD-tDCS is most often administered at 1\u20132\u2009mA for 20\u2009min. The most reported adverse events include tingling, itching and burning localized to the site of stimulation, typically described as mild or transient. Studies comparing active and sham stimulation generally report no significant differences in adverse event frequency or intensity, even at higher intensities of 2\u20133\u2009mA. Reports of severe adverse events are rare, and participant dropout due to discomfort is uncommon. Multi-session protocols show similar safety profiles, suggesting that repeated stimulation does not increase adverse effects. In clinical populations HD-tDCS is typically delivered across multiple sessions. Reported adverse events are mild and transient, with few reports of severe outcomes. Polarity-specific comparisons suggest that anodal and cathodal stimulation are similarly tolerated, with no notable differences in adverse event profiles.ConclusionOverall, current evidence indicates that HD-tDCS is a safe and well-tolerated technique across diverse populations and stimulation parameters. Continued use of standardized adverse event reporting will be important to further confirm these findings as clinical application broaden.",

    "content": "Lexical retrieval is commonly impaired in many persons with aphasia (PWA). Verbal fluency tasks are often used to assess lexical retrieval ability. However, common methods of analyzing verbal fluency data (e.g., total number of appropriate responses, clustering and switching) fail to adequately capture the underlying organization of the mental lexicon. To better understand the nature of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, this study applied a semantic network approach to verbal fluency data obtained from 120 healthy controls and 127 PWA (64 fluent and 63 nonfluent). Participants named as many animal category members as they could in 1\u202fmin, and their responses were converted into semantic networks. Global network metrics were computed for each group, including average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity. Compared to the healthy control network, the PWA network was less integrated and more fragmented, reflected by longer average shortest path lengths, reduced clustering, and higher modularity. These disruptions were especially evident in the nonfluent PWA network compared to the fluent PWA network. Complementary spreading activation and percolation analyses demonstrated that PWA networks were both less efficient and less resilient to disruption. Our results demonstrate that network-based analyses of verbal fluency provide a sensitive measure of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, revealing structural disruptions that are not fully captured by traditional analyses. More broadly, this approach highlights how network science can advance theories of lexical-semantic organization and inform the development of individualized clinical assessments and treatment strategies.",

    "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
    "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

Based on the rat model and clinical stroke patients, this paper combines multiple indicators such as electroencephalography (EEG) relative power (RP), Lempel-Ziv complexity and sample entropy to investigate the mechanism by which tDCS modulates neural oscillations in ischemic stroke. The results indicated that tDCS substantially reduced the RP of the \u03b4 frequency band, enhanced the normal oscillation of the \u03b1 frequency band, and improved the complexity index of the EEG signals. These findings suggest that tDCS could facilitate the recovery following ischemic stroke through the modulation of EEG rhythms.",

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "VCAP-102 Achieves Exceptional BBB Penetration in Marmosets After Ten Years of AAV Capsid Evaluation",
    "content": "Efficient passage of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for achieving broad central nervous system transduction following systemic delivery. Since PHP.B was reported in 2016 to exhibit high BBB permeability in C57BL/6J mice, many BBB-penetrant capsids have been developed, yet their performance often varies substantially across species. From 2016 to 2025, we produced each newly reported BBB-penetrant capsid as its sequence became available and evaluated it under standardized intravenous administration conditions in marmosets. This included PHP.B, PHP.eB, AAV-F, CAP-B22, CAP-B10, CPP.16, CAP-Mac, and BR1N. Although several of these capsids have been reported to penetrate the marmoset BBB, none reproduced these effects under our unified evaluation conditions. We also pursued several directed-evolution approaches to engineer AAV9-based variants with improved BBB permeability; however, none surpassed AAV9. In 2025, VCAP-102 was reported as an AAV9-derived capsid with BBB permeability in mice and non-human primates. When evaluated using our standardized framework, VCAP-102 consistently mediated markedly stronger and more widespread whole-brain transduction than AAV9 across all three animals tested. These findings provide a decade-long, systematic assessment of BBB-penetrant AAV capsids in marmosets and identify VCAP-102 as a highly promising candidate for future systemically delivered AAV-based gene therapies.",

    "title": "Stress Coping Style Alters Functional Brain Network Activity to Acute Stressor",
    "content": "Consistent individual differences in behavior (e.g., personality types, stress coping styles) are a common occurrence across animal taxa. One hypothesis poses that the resulting constraints for within-individual behavioral variation may also lead to constraints for the evolution of behavior. With stress coping styles seen across taxa, it suggests a common underlying proximate mechanism. In this study we investigated neural activity patterns across the brain by quantifying immediate early gene expression in individuals with alternative stress coping styles in response to an acute stressor in zebrafish (Danio rerio). While immediate early gene expression levels of individual brain regions in the aversive brain network were similar across groups, functional network activity differed. There were several differences across groups including interactions between the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal homologs. One brain area that had many different connections across groups was the central gray. There were many differences involving central gray activity between proactive and reactive fish at baseline suggesting that baseline activity may prime for the reaction to stress. Collectively, baseline brain activity can predict behaviors, suggesting that these differences in brain interactions at baseline may be important for biasing behavioral responses to stressors that characterizes a stress coping style.",

    "title": "Multiscale characterisation of the human claustrum from histology to MRI",
    "content": "Though linked to an unusually broad array of functions, the human claustrum's complex morphology has hindered in vivo study, resulting in a small MRI literature marked by implausibly large discrepancies in reported characteristics. We constructed the first three-dimensional histological \"gold standard\" claustrum model, and systematically evaluated in vivo 7-Tesla MRI datasets against it and downsampled derivatives. MRI showed resolution-dependent differences rather than contrast limitations, transforming the claustrum's intricate sheet into an artefactually thickened ribbon. However, submillimetre MRI reliably recovered the dorsal \"core\" that contains most claustral volume and density and houses major corticoclaustral connectivity. At 0.5mm resolution, extension into the temporal lobe, including irregular ventral \"puddles\", was partially recovered, with uncertainty reflecting boundary imprecision rather than anatomical loss. Our results refute the view that the claustrum is inaccessible in the living human brain, define practical measurement limits, and provide a foundation for future functional investigations.",

    "title": "Tissue-to-Bytes: A Catalytic Digital Twin Platform for Consortium-Scale Integration of Single-Cell Omics Data in BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network",
    "content": "The NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and data scientists to create reference brain cell atlases to be used by the research community as a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of human brain function and disorders. Coordinated sharing and management of the scarce human brain tissue, across lifespans and among the eleven participating BICAN centers and laboratories with anatomical precision, is a formidable undertaking. Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIPM provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone. The NIMP digital twin paradigm not only serves BICAN; it provides a blueprint for future-proof data coordination at consortium scale.",

    "content": "While Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically triggers cognitive decline, some individuals with significant AD pathology maintain normal cognition into late life. Understanding the neuronal underpinnings of such cognitive resilience would propel the development of interventions for delaying dementia. To this end, we used cognitive testing to identify a subset of cognitively resilient 13-month-old TgF344-AD rats (established AD) and their non-transgenic littermates, followed by Neuropixels recording from 8500 neurons during repeated somatosensory stimulation. Cognitively resilient TgF344-AD rats recruited fewer neurons yet displayed more stable neuronal representations during repeated stimulations in cortical excitatory and hippocampal inhibitory ensembles, with reduced excitatory spike burstiness during network activation and a distinct pattern of functional synaptic connectivity. These associations existed independently of amyloid and tau levels. For the first time, our study revealed neuronal population-level hallmarks of maintained cognition that may serve as a novel neurophysiological biomarker of cognitive resilience and a target for stabilizing cognition.",

    "title": "Genetic Targeting and Conductance-Based Modeling Reveal Novel Diversity Within Mouse Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons",
    "content": "Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit auditory signals from the cochlea to the brain and are divided into two main types: type I and type II, distinguished by their anatomy and connectivity. However, the function of type II SGNs remains poorly understood due to their scarcity and lack of clear physiological markers. In this study, we use two Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter mouse lines to enhance the identification and targeting of type II SGNs for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We reveal a set of distinguishing biophysical features, most notably, the presence of an inactivating potassium current and weaker voltage-gated sodium currents, that clearly separate type II SGNs from their type I counterparts. Additionally, we uncover greater-than-expected heterogeneity among type II SGNs, including variation in size, excitability, and ion channel expression. These features suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of type II SGNs, with potential differences in function. We find that most type II SGNs are relatively inexcitable and incapable of sustained firing. Instead, they appear to be better suited to integrating sustained signals, potentially supporting roles in detecting cochlear damage or modulating efferent feedback. Additionally, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that removing the inactivation component of the inactivating potassium current specific to type II SGNs allowed repetitive spiking to similar levels seen in type I SGNs, suggesting a crucial role for the current in stifling type II SGN activity. Together, our findings define biophysical signatures that distinguish SGN types and subtypes, offering new insight into their contributions to normal hearing and cochlear pathology.",

    "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "title": "Attentional responses to the color exposure sequence of landscape paintings: evidence from fNIRS and eye-tracking",
    "content": "IntroductionColor is a critical determinant of esthetic experience, shaping both immersion and cognitive responses. However, the extent to which the sequence of color exposure modulates the interplay between neural activation and ocular behavior remains insufficiently understood.MethodsTen chromatic landscape paintings were collected and converted into achromatic versions, yielding a total of 20 visual stimuli. Participants were assigned to two conditions: Condition A (achromatic to chromatic) and Condition B (chromatic to achromatic). Visual attention and prefrontal activation were assessed using eye-tracking techniques and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.ResultsAnalyses revealed significantly greater neural activation in Condition A within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.006), left orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043), and right orbitofrontal cortex (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.043). Eye-tracking metrics indicated longer Total duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.015), Maximum duration of fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.036), and Total duration of whole fixation (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.025) under Condition A. Subjective evaluations also showed significant differences, with higher ratings for Match (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.005) and Feel (p-raw\u2009=\u20090.029).DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that color stimuli exert a decisive influence not only on subjective immersion but also on objective neurocognitive processes. The study extends the scientific foundation of empirical esthetics and offers novel implications for the design of museum and exhibition environments.",

    "title": "Preliminary ERP evidence of the impact of loneliness on Stroop interference for socio-emotional stimuli",
    "content": "Growing evidence highlights the adverse clinical effects and societal implications of loneliness, i.e., the negative feeling associated with a perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social connections. To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",

    "content": "ObjectiveTo explore the risk factors of cognitive dysfunction in patients with leukoaraiosis (LA) and to construct a predictive model using machine learning.MethodsA total of 273 patients with LA were included. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The patients were divided into a training set (191 cases) and a validation set (82 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Seven machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, GBDT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) were employed to construct predictive models. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall, F1 score, MCC, AUROC, and SHAP was used for model interpretation.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, CRP, Fazekas score, and IASA score were associated with cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, Fazekas score, and IASA score were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an AUROC of 0.8373 for the validation set. SHAP analysis indicated that age, LDL-C, IASA score, and Fazekas score were the most important predictors.ConclusionThe Random Forest model can be used to predict the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with LA, providing a reference for early warning.",

    "content": "Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic secondary headache disorder that develops from excessive analgesic use. The prevalence of MOH is estimated 1\u20132% in the general population, reaching up to 50% among individuals with chronic headache. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MOH remain incompletely understood, neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into its developments. This review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that MOH is associated with structural and functional alterations in two key neural systems: (1) the pain matrix involved in nociceptive processing, (2) the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry implicated in addictive behaviors. Importantly, certain structural and functional changes show partial reversibility following medication withdrawal. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to establish causal relationships between these neurobiological changes and the development/maintenance of MOH, which remains essential for developing targeted interventions.",

    "title": "Development of a non-human primate model for preclinical research of a novel auditory nerve implant",
    "content": "The cochlear implant is a widely available hearing restoration technology that can provide speech understanding in quiet environments. This technology struggles however, in noisy settings or situations involving multiple speakers. The primary cause of these performance limitations is a poor neural interface, in which the bony wall of the cochlea separates the electrode surface from the auditory nerve fibers, thus causing unwanted current spread and non-specific frequency activation. This study utilizes an alternative auditory prosthetic technology (auditory nerve implant, ANI) that enables direct auditory nerve stimulation, which provides a potentially superior neural interface and enables more precise targeting of auditory nerve fibers than traditional cochlear implants. As auditory nerve implants progress towards clinical translation, new implant designs and stimulation strategies will be created. Animal models to efficiently test and iterate through these new designs will be useful for the continued development of ANI technology. We present a viable surgical approach in the non-human primate (rhesus macaque) along with electrophysiological results that demonstrate robust activation of the auditory system at low current levels via intraneural stimulation. Our findings indicate that the rhesus macaque, which possesses an inner ear anatomy more similar to the human compared to other animal models used in the hearing field (e.g., rodents, felines and ferrets), has strong potential as a useful preclinical testbed involving an upright head model for future ANI prototypes and stimulation strategy development.",

    "content": "BackgroundThis study investigated the brain functional characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain (NP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).MethodsA total of 35 subjects were enrolled, including 10 able-bodied controls, 12 patients with SCI and NP (SCI-NP), and 13 patients with SCI (without NP). fNIRS was used to detected blood oxygen signals during motor tasks and resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in the subjects. We also performed Pearson correlation analyses of pain scores (NPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in patients with SCI-NP. Statistical analyses were performed using Shapiro-Wilk test for normality; paired t-test for intra-group differences; ANOVA (LSD post-hoc, Bonferroni-corrected) for multi-group comparisons; Cohen's d/partial \u03b72 for effect size; independent samples t-test (FDR-corrected) for inter-group FC differences.ResultsDuring the task state, patients with SCI-NP activated bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1, L/R P = 0.044/0.032), bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA, L/R P = 0.041/0.037), right primary motor cortex and left parietal lobe (LPL, P = 0.047). Hemodynamic changes in the bilateral S1, secondary somatosensory cortex, SMA, and right prefrontal cortex of patients with SCI-NP were significantly stronger than those in the other two groups. During RS, the whole-brain and most inter/intra-regional FC strength trended able-bodied controls > patients with SCI > patients with SCI-NP. NPS strongly correlated with LPL (r = 0.977, P = 0.004); PSQI correlated with motor cortex HbO changes (r = 0.889\u22120.975, P = 0.005\u22120.043).ConclusionPatients with SCI-NP exhibit significant abnormal cerebral cortical excitation and reduced FC. HbO is a potential biomarker for evaluating NP. fNIRS supports objective assessment of SCI-NP and rehabilitation strategy formulation [ChiCTR2500097098].",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08032v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The usability of open-source software (OSS) is important but frequently overlooked in favor of technical and functional complexity. Argumentation can be a pivotal device for diverse stakeholders in OSS usability discussions to express opinions and persuade others. However, the characteristics of argument discourse in those discussions remain unknown, resulting in difficulties in providing effective support for discussion participants. We address this through a comprehensive analysis of argument discourse and quality in five OSS projects. Our results indicated that usability discussions are predominantly argument-driven, although their qualities vary. Issue comments exhibit lower-quality arguments than the issue posts, suggesting a shortage of collective intelligence about usability in OSS communities. Moreover, argument discourse and quality have various impacts on the subsequent behavior of participants. Overall, this research offers insights to help OSS stakeholders build more effective arguments and eventually improve OSS usability. These insights can also inform studies about other distributed collaborative communities.",

As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks. We conclude by outlining the most important research needs for translating vibration-based interventions into reliable and deployable clinical tools.",

This work introduces HOLE (Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings), a method for analyzing and interpreting deep neural networks through persistent homology. HOLE extracts topological features from neural activations and presents them using a suite of visualization techniques, including Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, dendrograms, and blob graphs. These tools facilitate the examination of representation structure and quality across layers. We evaluate HOLE on standard datasets using a range of discriminative models, focusing on representation quality, interpretability across layers, and robustness to input perturbations and model compression. The results indicate that topological analysis reveals patterns associated with class separation, feature disentanglement, and model robustness, providing a complementary perspective for understanding and improving deep learning systems.",

However, the perspectives of Deaf and Hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals remain marginalized in their development, particularly those outside of the West and in the global South. This paper presents findings from a global, multilingual survey capturing community views on SLTs across a wide range of countries, sign languages, and cultural contexts. While participants recognized the potential of SLTs to support access and independence, many expressed concerns about cultural erasure, inaccurate translation, and hearing-dominated research pipelines. Perceptions of SLTs were shaped by factors including sign language proficiency, policy exposure, and deaf identity. Across regions, participants emphasized the importance of DHH-led design, citing the risk of harm when DHH communities are excluded from technological decision-making. This study offers a novel cross-continental, community-informed analysis of SLTs and concludes with actionable recommendations for researchers, technologists, and policymakers.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08787v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collective memory -- community members' interconnected memories and impressions of the group -- is essential to the community's culture and identity. Its development requires members' continuous participatory contribution and sensemaking. However, existing works mainly adopt a holistic sociological perspective to analyze well-developed collective memory, less focusing on member-level conceptualization of this possession or what the co-contribution practices can be. Therefore, this work alternatively adopts the latter perspective and probes such interpretative and interactional patterns with two mobile systems. With one being a locative narrative and exploration system condensed from existing literature's design frameworks, and the other being a conventional online forum representing current practices, they served as the anchors of observation for our two-week, mixed-methods field study (n=38) on a university campus. A core debate we have identified was to retrospectively contemplate or document the presence as a history for the future. This also subsequently impacted the narrative focuses, expectations of collective memory constituents, and the ways participants seek inspiration from the group. We further extracted design considerations that could better embrace the diverse conceptualizations of collective memory and bond different community members together. Lastly, revisiting and reflecting on our design, we provided extra insights on designing devoted locative narrative experiences for community-driven UGC platforms.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Charging electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy can lessen their environmental impact. However, the fluctuating availability of renewable energy affects the sustainability of public EV charging stations. Nearby public charging stations may utilize differing energy sources due to their microgrid connections - ranging from exclusively renewable to non-renewable or a combination of both - highlighting the substantial variability in energy supply types within short distances. This study investigates the near-future scenario of integrating dynamic renewable energy availability in charging station navigation to impact the choices of EV users towards renewable sources. We conducted a within-subjects design survey with 50 car users and semi-structured interviews with 10 EV users from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The results show that when choosing EV charging stations, drivers often prioritize either time savings or money savings based on the driving scenarios that influence drivers' consumer value. Notably, EV users tend to select renewable-powered stations when they align with their main priority, be it saving money or time. This study offers end-user insights into the front-end graphic user interface and the development of the back-end ranking algorithm for navigation recommender systems that integrate dynamic renewable energy availability for the sustainable use of electric vehicles.",

However, many existing studies primarily focus on the humanrobot relationships that older adults form directly with robotic pets rather than exploring how these robotic pets can enhance human-human relationships. Our ethnographic study investigates how robotic pets can be designed to facilitate human relationships. Through semi-structured interviews with six older adults and thematic analysis, our empirical findings provide insights into how robotic pets can be designed as telerobots to connect with others remotely, thus contributing to advance future development of robotic systems for mental health.",

Designing for joint activity focuses on explicitly supporting the interdependencies between agents necessary for effective coordination among agents engaged in the joint activity. This builds and expands upon designing for usability to further address how technologies can be designed to act as effective team players. Effective joint activity requires supporting, at minimum, five primary macrocognitive functions within teams: Event Detection, Sensemaking, Adaptability, Perspective-Shifting, and Coordination. Supporting these functions is equally as important as making technologies usable. We synthesized fourteen heuristics from relevant literature including display design, human factors, cognitive systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science to aid the design, development, and evaluation of technologies that support joint human-machine activity.",

Previous efforts to promote privacy protection have largely focused on top-down approaches such as regulation and technology design, missing opportunities to understand how to empower users through bottom-up, collective approaches. Our paper addresses this by analyzing what and how privacy-related topics are discussed on Quora. We identified a wide range of interconnected privacy topics brought up by the users, including privacy risks and dangers, protection strategies, organizational practices, and existing laws and regulations. Our results highlight the interplay among the individual, technological, organizational, and societal factors affecting users' privacy attitudes. Moreover, we provide implications for designing community-based tools to better support users' collective efforts in navigating privacy, tools that incorporate users' diverse privacy-related behaviors and preferences, simplify information access and sharing, and connect designers and developers with the user community.",

    "title": "A Comparative Study of EMG- and IMU-based Gesture Recognition at the Wrist and Forearm",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.07997v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gestures are an integral part of our daily interactions with the environment. Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is the process of interpreting human intent through various input modalities, such as visual data (images and videos) and bio-signals. Bio-signals are widely used in HGR due to their ability to be captured non-invasively via sensors placed on the arm. Among these, surface electromyography (sEMG), which measures the electrical activity of muscles, is the most extensively studied modality. However, less-explored alternatives such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide complementary information on subtle muscle movements, which makes them valuable for gesture recognition. In this study, we investigate the potential of using IMU signals from different muscle groups to capture user intent. Our results demonstrate that IMU signals contain sufficient information to serve as the sole input sensor for static gesture recognition. Moreover, we compare different muscle groups and check the quality of pattern recognition on individual muscle groups. We further found that tendon-induced micro-movement captured by IMUs is a major contributor to static gesture recognition. We believe that leveraging muscle micro-movement information can enhance the usability of prosthetic arms for amputees. This approach also offers new possibilities for hand gesture recognition in fields such as robotics, teleoperation, sign language interpretation, and beyond.",

    "title": "Surface Waves and Axoplasmic Pressure Waves in Action Potential Propagation: Fundamentally Different Physics or Two Sides of the Same Coin?",
    "content": "arXiv:2505.24580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's \"surface wave\" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The \"surface wave\" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.",

    "title": "Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations",
    "content": "arXiv:2507.00269v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant statistical interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.",

    "title": "How random connectivity shapes the fluctuating dynamics of finite-size neural populations",
    "content": "arXiv:2412.16111v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Mesoscopic models of finite-size neuronal populations are crucial to understand the dynamics of neural networks in the brain, especially their fluctuations and response to stimuli. However, current theories to derive such models are based on homogeneous all-to-all (full) connectivity. This assumption neglects the variance in the connectivity of biologically realistic networks with connection probabilities $p<1$ (non-full connectivity). To gain insight into the different fluctuation mechanisms underlying neural variability at the population level, we derive and analyze a stochastic mean-field model for finite-size networks of Poisson neurons with random connectivity (including non-full connectivity), external noise and disordered mean inputs. We treat the quenched disorder of the connectivity by an annealed approximation enabling a doubly stochastic description of synaptic inputs for finite network size. A further reduction leads to a low-dimensional closed system of coupled Langevin equations for the mean and variance of the membrane potentials as well as a variable capturing finite-size fluctuations. Compared to microscopic simulations, the mesoscopic model describes the fluctuations and nonlinearities well and outperforms previous theories that neglected the variance in the connectivity. The joint effect of connectivity disorder and finite network size can be analytically understood by a softening of the effective nonlinearity and the multiplicative character of spiking noise. The mesoscopic theory shows that quenched disorder can stabilize the asynchronous state, and it correctly predicts large quantitative and non-trivial qualitative effects of connection probability on the variance of the population firing rate and its dependence on stimulus strength. In conclusion, our theory elucidates how disordered connectivity shapes nonlinear dynamics and fluctuations of neural populations.",

    "title": "Sleep effects on brain, cognition, and mental health during adolescence are mediated by the glymphatic system",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.08704v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Background: Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation and heightened vulnerability to cognitive and mental health disorders. Sleep plays a vital role in neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep to adverse brain and behavioral outcomes remain unclear. The glymphatic system (GS), a brain-wide clearance pathway, may provide a key mechanistic link. Methods: Participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n =6,800; age ~ 11 years) were categorized into sleep-sufficient (>=9 h/night) and sleep-insufficient (<9 h/night) groups. Linear models tested associations among sleep, PVS burden, brain volumes, and behavioral outcomes. Mediation analyses evaluated whether PVS burden explained sleep-related effects. Results: Adolescents with insufficient sleep exhibited significantly greater PVS burden, reduced cortical, subcortical, and white matter volumes, poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains (largest effect in crystallized intelligence), and elevated psychopathology (largest effect in general problems). Sleep duration and quality were strongly associated with PVS burden. Mediation analyses revealed that PVS burden partially mediated sleep effects on cognition and mental health, with indirect proportions up to 10.9%. Sequential models suggested a pathway from sleep -> PVS -> brain volume -> behavior as the most plausible route. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep during adolescence is linked to glymphatic dysfunction, reflected by increased PVS burden, which partially accounts for adverse effects on brain structure, cognition, and mental health. These findings highlight the GS as a potential mechanistic pathway and imaging biomarker, underscoring the importance of promoting adequate sleep to support neurodevelopment and mental health.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.08815v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurons, as eukaryotic cells, have powerful internal computation capabilities. One neuron can have many distinct states, and brains can use this capability. Processes of neuron growth and maintenance use chemical signalling between cell bodies and synapses, ferrying chemical messengers over microtubules and actin fibres within cells. These processes are computations which, while slower than neural electrical signalling, could allow any neuron to change its state over intervals of seconds or minutes. Based on its state, a single neuron can selectively de-activate some of its synapses, sculpting a dynamic neural net from the static neural connections of the brain. Without this dynamic selection, the static neural networks in brains are too amorphous and dilute to do the computations of neural cognitive models. The use of multi-state neurons in animal brains is illustrated in hierarchical Bayesian object recognition. Multi-state neurons may support a design which is more efficient than two-state neurons, and scales better as object complexity increases. Brains could have evolved to use multi-state neurons. Multi-state neurons could be used in artificial neural networks, to use a kind of non-Hebbian learning which is faster and more focused and controllable than traditional neural net learning. This possibility has not yet been explored in computational models.",

The core message here is modest: the paper offers an interesting analogy and an eye-catching fit, but several key steps mix physical claims with definitions and curve-fitting choices. We highlight three such points: (i) a normalization issue that is presented as \"bosonic enhancement\", (ii) an identification of rank with energy that makes the BE fit only weakly diagnostic of an underlying mechanism, and (iii) a baseline comparison that is too weak to support an ontological conclusion. We also briefly flag a few additional concerns (interpretation drift, parameter semantics, and reproducibility).",

Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding man- ifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns; while the readout module achieves biological fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, we present this work as a study of the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns.",

    "title": "Enhanced ex vivo 3D whole-brain mapping and automated analysis of Parkinson's disease pathologies in mice",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates, which are thought to drive neurodegeneration in vulnerable neuronal populations, particularly within the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship between -syn aggregation and dopaminergic cell degeneration by developing an optimized analysis pipeline for efficient whole-brain mapping. We injected -syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of wild-type mice, using monomeric -syn-injected mice as the control group. Aggregate propagation and dopaminergic degeneration were analyzed using antibodies against phosphorylated -syn (pS129) and tyrosine hydroxylase, followed by brain clearing combined with high-resolution (<4 m) light-sheet microscopy (LSM), coupled with automated pipeline data analysis. Whole-brain LSM mapping revealed dense somatic and neuritic phosphorylated -syn aggregates within dopaminergic neurons of the SNc 12 weeks post-unilateral PFF injection, accompanied by significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and prion-like propagation -syn aggregates to anatomically connected brain regions, including the striatum. The distribution pattern of -syn pathology visualized by LSM was validated by whole-brain immunohistochemical analysis of PFF-injected mouse brains. The 3D LSM approach introduced here uniquely captures the spatial organization and propagation of -syn pathology and dopaminergic degeneration across interconnected brain networks.",

    "title": "Preoptic Neurons that Regulate Hibernation Entry",
    "content": "Seasonal hibernation allows species to survive harsh environments by entering a profound hypometabolic and hypothermic state called deep torpor (DT). However, the neural mechanisms controlling entry into this state remain poorly understood. Here, we map neuronal activity across hibernation stages in the Syrian hamster and identify DT-associated activity in the hypothalamic anterior preoptic area (aPOA) as essential for hibernation entry. Single-nucleus multiomic profiling enabled the design of a novel enhancer adeno-associated virus selectively targeting candidate glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations. Using this tool, we demonstrate that activity of a subpopulation of Samd3-positive glutamatergic neurons in the hamster aPOA is both necessary and sufficient for DT induction. Together, our findings identify a neuronal population regulating hibernation entry and provide the first genetic access to manipulate this complex behavior.",

    "content": "The development of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology in Alzheimer s disease (AD) is accompanied by profound changes in astrocytes and microglia. How these responses are orchestrated by cell surface proteins, key mediators of cell-cell communication, remain unclear. Using in situ astrocyte cell-surface proteome profiling in 5xFAD mice, we identified a set of dysregulated surface proteins induced by A{beta} pathology, including CD44. CD44 was selectively upregulated in plaque-adjacent astrocytes and interacted with osteopontin (OPN), encoded by the diseaseassociated microglia gene Spp1, to promote lipid accumulation, and this effect is {gamma}-secretase dependent. Astrocytic CD44 in turn regulated Spp1 expression and microglial activity. Conditional deletion of Cd44 in adult astrocytes of 5xFAD mice attenuated glial reactivity, reduced A{beta} pathology, and improved cognition. These findings define a plaque-proximal OPN-CD44 axis that controls astrocyte lipid metabolism and glial activity, positioning CD44 as a surface-accessible therapeutic target in AD.",

    "title": "Early intervention with a PACAP lactoside following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury prevents persistent LHb hyperactivity and motivational deficits in male mice",
    "content": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often leads to long-lasting mood disorders and motivational deficits, significantly decreasing quality of life. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has known neuroprotective effects and is often deficient in neurological conditions, but its role in preventing mTBI's long-term effects on mood circuits remains unclear. Our previous studies of repetitive closed-head mTBI in murine models found that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a key area for post-injury impairments. These impairments are characterized by mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and mood-related behavioral deficits. Here we investigated if a novel PACAP type I receptor (PAC1R) agonist, TES2320, could prevent or treat these long-term mTBI effects. The drug is based on a truncated glycoside analogue of PACAP that is stable and brain penetrant. Using RNAscope, we first found that mTBI caused a persistent and widespread reduction in PACAP mRNA within the LHb, suggesting a possible mTBI-related PACAP signaling deficiency in LHb circuits. We then used two intervention strategies in young adult male mice: an early intervention administered immediately after injury and a late intervention given as a single injection one-month post-injury. One month after injury, we measured LHb activity and self-care grooming motivation. Both early and late PAC1 agonist interventions almost completely normalized the mTBI-induced increases in LHb spontaneous tonic activity and hyperexcitability. However, only the early intervention improved the delayed initiation of grooming seen in mTBI mice. Unfortunately, a single late PAC1R agonist injection not only failed to reverse the grooming delay, but also significantly reduced total grooming behavior 24 hours after treatment. This finding points to a potential behavioral side effect of late PAC1R agonist administration on grooming. Overall, our findings confirm that an early PAC1R agonist intervention effectively prevents mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and associated motivational deficits, likely by restoring the persistent PACAP signaling deficiency in the LHb and its related circuits. This preclinical study provides strong evidence that novel PAC1R agonists could be a valuable preventive therapy for mTBI-related depression and anti-reward circuit dysfunction.",

    "title": "Tether-mediated extraction of myelinoid bodies by microglia and astrocytes can maintain myelin integrity",
    "content": "Oligodendrocytes make myelin for the electrical insulation of axons and saltatory impulse conduction. Myelin lipids and proteins undergo a slow turnover, but exactly how the multilamellar and compacted membrane sheaths are remodeled without compromising myelin sheath integrity has remained puzzling, in particular at advanced age when myelin abnormalities increase. Earlier EM studies had suggested myelin membranes are shed and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia. However, the formation of multilamellar myelinoid bodies (MBs), leaving a well-ordered myelin sheath behind, is difficult to reconcile with simple shedding mechanisms. Here, we show by three-dimensional FIB-SEM reconstructions of optic nerves in mice and by two-photon live-imaging of myelinated cortical slices that MBs are initially connected to their parental sheaths by long tethers, which are stretched by trogocytosing microglia and astrocytes. We observe ruptured tethers attached to both MBs and sheaths, suggesting a novel mechanism of tension-driven tether scission. Importantly, the successive fusion of the corresponding innermost myelin membranes in an extended tether can preserve myelin sheath integrity. Thus, the remodeling by tether-mediated MB extraction emerges as a mechanism of physiological maintenance of myelin sheaths in the CNS.",

    "title": "Loss of neurexins disrupts inhibitory connectivity and increases vulnerability of dopamine neurons in culture",
    "content": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are essential regulators of basal ganglia function. Their axonal structure is intricate, with numerous non-synaptic release sites and fewer synaptic terminals that notably release glutamate or GABA. Despite their significance, the molecular mechanisms governing DA neuron connectivity and neurochemical identity remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins (Nrxns) regulate the interactions of DA neuron axons with target cells and thereby influence axonal branching and synapse formation by DA neurons. We therefore examined neuronal survival, axonal growth and synapse formation in cultured DA neurons lacking all neurexins (DAT::NrxnsKO). Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons revealed that loss of Nrxns does not disrupt the basic development of these neurons or the structure of their axonal terminals, including normal expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, loss of Nrxns affects the survival of DA neurons and their formation of inhibitory synapses, suggesting that Nrxns regulate the axonal connectivity of these neurons.",

    "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
    "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

    "title": "Electroconvulsive Therapy Induces Dopaminergic Axon Regeneration, Corticostriatal Remodeling, and Restoration of Motor Function in Parkinsonian Mice",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons with loss of axonal dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum, leading to striatal circuit dysfunction and debilitating motor symptoms. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not restore lost neuronal function. Decades of clinical observations have reported the unexpected observation that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a standard treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, can incidentally alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD, two weeks of repeated ECT produced robust and sustained motor recovery, with improvements in locomotion and sensorimotor asymmetry persisting for at least 30 days post-treatment. Remarkably, ECT induced dopaminergic axonal sprouting from surviving dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located at the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental border, leading to a partial recovery of striatal dopaminergic axonal reinnervation. In striatal direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), which exhibit pathological hyperexcitability and spine loss following dopamine depletion, ECT normalized both corticostriatal synaptic responses and spine density. Consistently, ECT upregulated gene transcripts involved in cytoskeletal remodeling while downregulating those associated with glutamatergic signaling and neuronal excitability. These changes were accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional shift toward enhanced mitochondrial anabolic capacity and energy production, including increased expression of genes involved in ATP and Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that ECT can partially restore basal ganglia circuitry following dopamine depletion and provide a basis for further study of its potential as a noninvasive, disease-modifying intervention for PD.",

    "title": "Tau interactions with inner nuclear envelope proteins modulates chromatin",
    "content": "Intracellular re-distribution of the neuronal microtubule associated protein Tau, from the axon into the somatodendritic compartment, is a physiological stress-related event that increases Tau in the soma and enables Tau interactions with the nucleus. Cellular functions of stress-induced Tau-Nucleus interactions are unknown. Combining proximity biotinylation interactomics with chromatin imaging and molecular reconstitution assays, we uncover that physiological Tau interacts with proteins coordinating chromatin at the nuclear membrane, including lamin B receptor, thereby changing their DNA interactions. Accordingly, we find that increasing somatodendritic Tau is sufficient to dysregulate expression of genes in lamin associated domains and transcription factors, collectively leading to an upregulation of stress response pathways and downregulation of cholesterol metabolic genes. These nuclear envelope-related mechanisms suggest that neuronal stress-related somatodendritic Tau missorting can initiate chromatin-related cascades important for early changes in AD and tauopathies.",

    "title": "Anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus",
    "content": "The medial thalamus (MTh) is a critical hub for integrating the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet its cellular and circuit organization remains poorly defined. Here, we combine activity-dependent genetic tagging, whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and viral circuit tracing to build a comprehensive anatomical and molecular atlas of nociceptive and opioidergic neurons within the MTh. We show that acute and chronic pain activate distinct, spatially localized microdomains across multiple MTh subnuclei, including the central medial, interanteromedial, mediodorsal, and xiphoid nuclei. Activity-dependent tagging reveals a stable ensemble of nociceptive neurons that remains engaged across acute and chronic pain states, suggesting persistent thalamic encoding of affective nociception. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we find that most nociceptive-activated neurons express Oprm1, and that nearly all Oprm1 neurons are activated by nociceptive stimuli, identifying a pain-active, -opioid receptor-expressing population in MTh (MThMOR). Rabies-based tracing demonstrates that MThMOR neurons receive convergent inputs from nociceptive and inhibitory regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and habenula, while projecting broadly to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures involved in pain, arousal, and motivation. Enkephalinergic inputs to MTh arise from distinct, non-nociceptive populations, suggesting parallel pathways for nociceptive transmission and endogenous opioid modulation. Together, these findings define the anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus and highlight MThMOR neurons as a cell-type-specific substrate for the development of targeted opioid-based pain therapies.",

    "title": "Phospho-signalling deregulation of the mTOR pathway in fibroblasts from LRRK2 Parkinson s patients",
    "content": "Activating mutations at the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Using in-depth mass-spectrometry, here we analysed the impact of LRRK2 mutations on the proteome and phospho-proteome of skin fibroblasts from a large LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain. The cohort encompassed G2019S LRRK2-associated PD (L2PD) (n=15), G2019S LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers (L2NMCs) (n=13), idiopathic PD (iPD) (n=12), and control subjects (n=14) (total n=54). The proteome analysis revealed 89 differential proteins in G2019S L2PD (58 down/ 31 up) and 168 in G2019S L2NMCs (127 down / 41 up) compared to controls. Most of these proteome changes involved deficits in proteins related to mitochondrial energy and ribosomal protein synthesis. At the phospho-proteome level, we identified 394 differential phospho-sites in G2019S L2PD (188 hyper / 206 hypo), 367 in G2019S L2NMCs (215 hyper / 152 hypo), and 428 in iPD (214 hyper / 214 hypo) compared with controls. These phospho-proteomic changes included hyper-phosphorylated proteins associated with the mTOR and Rho GTPase pathways. Notably, the top hyper-phosphorylated hit in G2019S carriers was pThr37/46 4E-BP1, a key effector of the mTOR pathway controlling protein synthesis, and this protein was also deregulated in iPD. In summary, our study uncovers peripheral deregulation of mTOR phospho-signalling associated with LRRK2 mutations, which is related to deficits in mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins, and affects converging pathways altered in iPD.",

    "title": "Encoding and Decoding of Brain Dynamic Functional Connectivity for ADHD Diagnosis",
    "content": "Recent studies have demonstrated strong associations between the changes in dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and both behavioral and cognitive functions. The sliding window technique is the most widely used method for evaluating dynamic FC; however, it faces two key challenges: distributional shifts across windows and high dimensionality, as FC is computed across windows of the entire time series. To address these issues, we propose BRAINMAP (Bi-level Representation using Attention for INterpretability with Mamba-Aided Prediction) to model the dynamic FC of the brain. BRAINMAP employs the Optimal Transport technique to correct distributional shifts across sliding windows and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a hybrid approach that integrates an attention mechanism and the Mamba block to effectively capture spatiotemporal features for functional MR images. Finally, we introduce a novel Top-K sliding window feature selection algorithm to induce sparsity in dynamic FC. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our model for diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using three resting-state fMRI datasets: ADHD-200, UCLA, and CNI-TLC, which comprise a total of 447 subjects with ADHD and 845 typically developing controls. Our architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art dynamic FC models in ADHD detection, achieving improvements ranging from 3% to 12% across the three datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces robust biomarkers, most notably the connection between the dorsal attention network and the visual network. Using an association study, we further establish the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers.",

    "title": "Metabolic modelling and time-resolved mapping of glucose oxidative metabolism in rats brain by indirect deuterium detection with 1H-FID-MRSI at 9.4T",
    "content": "Object: The present study exploits newly developed dynamic indirect 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI at 9.4T, combined with a dedicated metabolic model, to enable regional and quantitative characterization of glucose oxidative metabolism flux in the rat brain with minimal metabolic assumptions, by measuring both 2H-labelled Glx turnover and pool size along a controlled 2H-Glc infusion protocol. Materials and Methods: Seven rats underwent dynamic 2D 1H-FID-MRSI during a 2-hour infusion of [6,6'-2H2] glucose. Consecutive 13-min acquisitions quantified Glx-C4 1H-signal decay, converted to 2H-Glx concentrations using baseline metabolite pool sizes. A three-pool kinetic model including 2H-label loss was fitted to regional turnover curves to estimate oxidative flux (Vgt) and pyruvate dilution (Kdil). Model performance and parameter robustness were finally assessed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: In vivo 2H-Glx turnover showed a saturated exponential rise (~60 min), with a labelling plateau higher in striatum (1.85 mol/g) than hippocampus (1.55 mol/g). Metabolic modelling provided region-specific oxidative fluxes: Vgt = 0.27 {+/-} 0.07 mol/g/min (hippocampus) and Vgt = 0.40 {+/-} 0.06 mol/g/min (striatum), with consistent Kdil across regions. Simulations confirmed a good model robustness in retrieving Vgt over a large range of experimental conditions. Discussion: This work shows the appropriateness of indirect dynamic 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI for quantitative metabolic flux mapping of cerebral glucose oxidative metabolism.

    "title": "Towards harmonized spectral quantification in MRSI: Comparative analysis of Backward-Linear-Predicted and original 1H-FID-MRSI dephased data",
    "content": "Object: We hypothesized that the inherent acquisition delay (AD) in 1H-FID-MRSI can introduce systematic LCModel quantification biases due to strong spectral dephasing, and that Backward-Linear-Prediction (BLP) reconstruction toward AD = 0 ms can harmonize metabolite estimates across acquisitions with various delays. Materials and Methods: 2D 1H-FID-MRSI were acquired in rats at 14.1T with three AD values (0.71, 0.94, 1.30 ms). Hippocampal metabolites were quantified using LCModel and AD-matched basis sets. Complementary Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 1000) replicated 1H-FID-MRSI spectra at multiple ADs under realistic SNR conditions. BLP was applied to in vivo and simulated FIDs to back-predict missing points up to AD = 0 ms, enabling quantification within a unified basis set framework. Results: In vivo and simulated data showed clear AD-dependent variations for several metabolites (Gln, tCho, tNAA, Ins, Tau), with discrepancies frequently >10% despite AD-specific basis sets. Simulations confirmed metabolite-specific biases increasing with AD. BLP reconstruction preserved quantification consistency up to 0.98 ms of recovered FIDs, reducing inter-AD mismatches in vivo - particularly for Tau, tNAA and tCho - lowering the mean discrepancy from 10.5% to approx. 5%. Discussion: These findings show that AD affects 1H-FID-MRSI quantification in LCModel, whereas BLP reconstruction can harmonize spectra across delays by enabling a virtual AD = 0 ms quantification scheme. This supports BLP as a practical strategy to improve consistency and comparability in MRSI studies.

    "title": "Structure-Function Coupling Aligns with a Unimodal-to-Transmodal Gradient in the Mouse Cortex",
    "content": "Understanding how anatomical connectivity shapes brain activity is essential for clarifying brain function and disorders. In the human brain, the regional heterogeneity in structure-function (S-F) coupling is well characterized by measuring correlations between structural and functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether the same principles apply to the mouse cortex, where biological mechanisms can be studied directly. Here, we mapped S-F coupling across the mouse cortex by combining high-resolution structural connectivity derived from axonal tracing with resting-state functional connectivity measured by wide-field calcium imaging. Our findings revealed that structural connectivity imposes a robust yet regionally variable constraint on functional connectivity. As in humans, the S-F coupling was strong in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas, demonstrating a gradient from unimodal-to-transmodal cortical organization. This spatial variation covaried with intrinsic cellular properties, including myelination, excitation-inhibition balance, synaptic density, and gene expression profiles, but did not align with the anatomically defined cortical hierarchy. Our findings highlight graded S-F coupling as a common organizational principle in both the mouse and human cortex, providing a framework for future mechanistic studies using mouse models.",

    "title": "Dentate gyrus drives pattern separation in proximal CA3 during rate, but not global, remapping",
    "content": "Pattern separation converts overlapping experiences into discrete memory traces, with granule-cell sparsity in the dentate gyrus (DG) thought to execute this computation. Proximal CA3 is functionally aligned with the DG through dense reciprocal connectivity, yet the manner in which DG output governs pattern separation within proximal CA3 remains unresolved. This study combined selective DG lesions with high-resolution recordings across the CA3 while rats explored environments that varied in contextual similarity. Global remapping in CA3 remained largely intact following DG lesion, but rate remapping was almost entirely abolished. Discrimination impairments were most pronounced in proximal CA3 and attenuated along the transverse axis toward distal CA3, paralleling the topography of mossy-fiber projections. These data support a hierarchical and mode-specific framework for pattern separation: the entorhinal cortex selects between global and rate remapping according to input dissimilarity, while the DG selectively enhances discrimination of similar inputs via rate-based modulation. This mechanism clarifies how the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit resolves overlapping experiences into distinct memory representations.",

    "title": "Profiles of Aging Based on Cognition, Affect, and Brain Reserve",
    "content": "The aging paradox describes improvements in emotional wellbeing as a function of aging, despite declines in cognition. Conversely, late life depression has been associated with increased cognitive decline in aging. We sought to understand these seemingly contradictory patterns of cognitive and mental health in older age. Building on cognitive reserve, affective reserve, and brain reserve models of aging, we developed three alternative algorithmic approaches to group N=22,686 participants from the UK Biobank into different profiles of aging. Our results revealed that aging profiles identified using our data-driven brain reserve model, which incorporated measures of cognition, neuroticism, and brain volume, achieved the highest validation results. Importantly, only two of the four aging profiles were characterized by the aging paradox (i.e., improved emotionality and decreased cognition with age). We identified one profile characterized by particularly low levels of neuroticism and relative resilience to cognitive decline. Another profile benefited from relatively preserved brain volumes, potentially driven by younger ages and/or higher socioeconomic status. Conversely, we identified two profiles with poorer health characteristics, including one profile with elevated cardiovascular risk. Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of the emotion paradox and highlight the value of taking a nuanced and stratified approach when studying aging. In the future, aging profiles could be used to target preventative strategies to address modifiable risk factors and improve lifespan and healthspan.",

    "title": "Behavioral orienting but not novelty activates dopamine neurons",
    "content": "Novel stimuli have a profound impact on brain function and behavior. They evoke attention, arousal and sensory exploration and induce synaptic plasticity in brain regions related to learning and memory. Many of these effects have been attributed to novelty-evoked activation of the dopaminergic midbrain and dopamine (DA) release in major projection targets in the striatum. However, it remains controversial if individual DA neurons respond to novel stimuli. To address this question, we recorded and manipulated DA neurons in mice exposed to novel and familiar odors while monitoring orienting behaviors including exploratory sniffing, facial movements, and pupil dilation. We found that DA neurons were activated by orienting behaviors, rather than by novelty itself. Moreover, their activity was causally involved in generating the orienting responses. Finally, we identified a major input region to the dopaminergic midbrain which couples orienting to DA firing. Activity in the mediodorsal pons (mdPons) correlated tightly with sniffing and facial movements. Consequently, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic mdPons neurons induced both orienting and DA firing. Our findings suggest that DA neurons do not respond to novelty per se but are activated through descending glutamatergic projections from the mdPons. This mechanism links salient sensory events to DA release, providing a basis for novelty-evoked exploration and plasticity.",

    "content": "Functional connectivity (FC) measurements in the brain using BOLD fMRI have largely focused on correlations between gray-matter (GM) BOLD signals, ignoring the possible relevance of white-matter (WM) in delineating neural networks. We first employed a tract-informed mediation framework to test whether WM pathways contribute indirect, bundle-specific effects to cortico-cortical coupling. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we quantified pathway-level mediation effects across GM-WM-GM units and found that WM BOLD signals significantly mediated GM-GM associations, with clear tract-dependent heterogeneity. Building upon this, we examined how dynamic features of WM BOLD signals relate to time-varying intra-cortical FC. We found that temporal variability of WM signals, rather than their mean amplitudes, more closely tracked fluctuations in GM-GM dynamic connectivity, with correlations reaching approximately 0.4 across specific tracts. Together, these results indicate that WM BOLD signals are related to how cortical regions interact, underscoring their integral role in large-scale brain network organization.",

    "title": "Master clock-thalamic-prefrontal circuit controls circadian social priority",
    "content": "Social behaviors arise from complex brain operations that adapt to intricate targets and varying states. Achieving a singular social goal requires an extensive social brain network, of which computation is malleable and subject to modulation by diverse internal factors. However, how the brain leverages its internal state to navigate competing social goals is elusive. Here we show that the priority between competing instincts-social novelty versus sexual preference-exhibits a distinct circadian pattern. This is controlled by a two-component circuit linking the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain region in the social brain network. Specifically, SCNVIP neurons project to Vipr2-expressing neurons within the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), which in turn projects to the mPFC to mediate this behavior. The function of Vipr2 in the RE is critical for shaping the circadian pattern of both appetitive and consummatory social behaviors. This allows higher social functions to be engaged in a timely manner, appropriately aligning prioritized social behaviors with the body's clock-regulated reproductive system. Overall, this SCN-RE-mPFC circuit provides a neural principle through which the master clock coordinates the prefrontal cortex to resolve a conflict of motivated behaviors by referencing an internal state.",

    "title": "Modeling the Action-Perception Loop and its role in Phantom Limb Pain using Active Inference",
    "content": "Phantom limb pain is among the most prevalent and distressing consequences of limb amputation. Theories regarding its underlying mechanisms remain disputed, contributing to challenges in effectively treating the pain. In recent years, mathematical models grounded in the Bayesian inference framework have been used to describe various aspects of pain perception. However, pain is not only passively inferred but actively shaped through interactions with the environment--a dimension that classical Bayesian approaches typically do not capture. Because amputation disrupts both sensory input related to the limb and the ability to perform actions, a model incorporating both sensory and active components of pain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain. To this end, we developed a model within the active inference framework, which extends Bayesian inference to include action selection. The model provides a conceptual account of how loss of limb control, ambiguity in sensory input pertaining to limb position, residual noxious input, and preamputation pain may contribute to the emergence and persistence of phantom limb pain. Furthermore, it offers insight into the possible mechanisms underlying common interventions and may help account for their variable efficacy across individuals.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "title": "Motion sequencing reveals hidden patterns of repetitive behavior in a mouse model of epilepsy",
    "content": "Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological condition with 50 million cases worldwide. Patients with epilepsy bare a disproportionate burden of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders which remain poorly understood and go underdressed by current anti-epileptic treatments. Furthermore, pre-clinical work on behavioral comorbidities can be hampered by current testing frameworks which rely on well-defined, discreet tests with limited repeatability. Recent work has demonstrated a role for machine learning modalities such as Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) in assessing behavioral differences between naive and epileptic. In this study we combined MoSeq with a novel analysis pipeline to uncover repetitive behaviors in chronically epileptic mice. These repetitive behaviors emerge alongside epilepsy specific racing behaviors which persist in epileptic mice as disease progresses. Finally, we show that epileptic mice have more fragile and dispersed behavioral networks. Together, these results lay a groundwork for extracting clinically relevant phenotypes from MoSeq data throughout disease progression.",

    "title": "Social isolation upregulates takeout expression in female Drosophila melanogaster to promote sucrose feeding",
    "content": "Drosophila melanogaster provides a model system to examine how environmental stress interacts with sex to induce changes in brain function and behavior. Previous research suggests that social isolation induces changes in gene expression that encode a starvation-like brain state and reduce sleep. However, the extent to which social isolation alters behaviors via sex-specific brain changes is unclear. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to explore sex differences in chronic social isolation-induced behavioral and transcriptomic changes. We focused on takeout (to), a gene encoding a putative juvenile hormone-binding protein, as a target that is upregulated solely in females following social isolation. Male and female adult flies were exposed to chronic social isolation, and multiple behavioral sex differences were identified through tests of activity, motivation, aggression, and sugar consumption. RNA-seq analysis also identified several candidate genes that were associated with sex differences in isolation-induced behavioral changes. Our findings suggest that social isolation is sufficiently stressful to reveal latent sex differences in behavior, despite having no impact on survival. To expression and sucrose consumption were upregulated exclusively in females following social isolation. Following to knockdown in to-expressing cells, sucrose consumption decreased in socially isolated females but increased in males. However, to knock down, to overexpression, and transformer knock down in neurons did not change sucrose-feeding behavior between control and isolated females. Overall, our results suggest that manipulating to expression influences sucrose-feeding in opposite directions between females and males following social isolation, and that isolation-induced to overexpression in non-neuronal cells in the brain or head may play a role in communicating information about females nutritional status to the brain. Additional roles for to in stress-related behaviors and behavioral sex differences should be explored, as well as whether to participates in signaling pathways that may be functionally conserved in human disorders.",

    "content": "A major goal within molecular systems neuroscience is to bridge the study of neuronal circuit function with changes in protein expression and localization in awake behaving animals. However, there are limited tools for capturing changes in subcellularly-defined proteomes within neuronal circuits during activity-gated timescales in vivo. Here, we engineered targeted versions of the proximity labeling enzyme TurboID, to tag proteins at the neuronal membrane during a user-delivered biotin injection. We optimized a labeling strategy that enables a one-to-two-hour labeling window and tagged proteins in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) cell bodies and corresponding axons in two downstream projections. We performed proteomics to identify proteins enriched in the distinct mPFC axonal projections, and discovered proteins enriched following an acute cocaine injection in mPFC cell bodies. These advancements enable the detection of proteins at the subcellular level within short labeling windows, allowing identification of stimulus-specific proteomes in behaving mice.",

    "title": "Shaft versus spine localization affects the structural plasticity of glutamatergic synapses",
    "content": "In the early stages of development, most excitatory synapses are formed directly on dendritic shafts. As neurons mature, these sites gradually shift from the shaft to dendritic spines. In fully developed excitatory neurons, the majority of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites containing the postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules reside on dendritic spines. However, some glutamatergic synapses remain as shaft synapses, yet their characteristics have remained unexplored. Here, we show that the molecular composition of the shaft PSDs closely resembles that of spine PSDs. Key components such as AMPARs, NMDARs, CaV1.2 channels, and F-actin interacting proteins, SynGAP, as well as cortactin, are present in comparable amounts in both synapse types. The major distinction between shaft and spine PSDs lies in the lower abundance of the scaffold proteins Shanks and Homer in shaft PSDs. Shaft synapses are not merely passive structures but actively participate in synaptic transmission. Their structure and function are modulated by changes in neuronal activity. Long-term live imaging combined with a cLTP protocol revealed that shaft PSDs were potentiated but rarely underwent a transition to spine synapses. In contrast, during LTD, shaft PSDs were eliminated more frequently than their spine counterparts. Together, these findings highlight excitatory shaft synapses as a distinct, and notably less stable, synapse type.",

    "title": "NKCC1 as a signaling hub regulating KCC2 stability, chloride homeostasis, and seizure susceptibility",
    "content": "Chloride homeostasis relies on the dynamic balance between the neuronal co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. We reveal an unexpected mechanism by which NKCC1 governs KCC2 membrane stability. NKCC1 clusters recruits SPAK and PP1 to dynamically trap KCC2, compensating for its lack of a direct SPAK-binding site. Single-particle tracking shows that these NKCC1-rich assemblies operate as signaling hubs, enabling either SPAK-driven KCC2 phosphorylation and its membrane destabilization or PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of SPAK and KCC2 membrane stabilization. Peptides that activate SPAK by engaging NKCC1 PP1-binding motif lower KCC2 surface levels and reduce chloride extrusion, whereas a SPAK-inhibiting peptide prevents SPAK recruitment to NKCC1, stabilizes KCC2 in membrane clusters, and enhances chloride extrusion. An optimized peptide analog preserves KCC2 clustering under hyperexcitable conditions, reduces seizure frequency and severity in PTZ-induced epilepsy, and suppresses ictal activity in human epileptic tissue. These findings identify NKCC1-KCC2 coupling as a central regulatory axis for inhibitory signaling, and position our peptides as promising therapeutic candidates to restore chloride homeostasis in epilepsy and other disorders marked by impaired KCC2 membrane stability.",

    "title": "Selective Inactivation of Astrocytic Monoacylglycerol Lipase for Alzheimer Disease Therapy",
    "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, yet effective therapies remain lacking. Here, we identify monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the principal enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, specifically in astrocytes as a promising therapeutic target for AD. APP transgenic (TG) mice with astrocyte-specific MAGL deletion (T-aKO), but not neuron-specific deletion (TG-nKO), exhibit markedly reduced A{beta} pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, along with preserved synaptic structure and function and improved cognition. These benefits are recapitulated in TG mice by AAV-mediated silencing of astrocytic MAGL, whereas MAGL overexpression accelerates neuropathology and exacerbates synaptic and cognitive deficits. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that dysregulated synapse-, inflammation-, and AD-related gene expression profiles are reversed in TG-aKO mice. MAGL expression is elevated in astrocytes from both AD patients and TG mice. Remarkably, a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV-MAGL-shRNA administered at either presymptomatic or postsymptomatic stages prevents or reverses neuropathology and synaptic and cognitive impairments in TG mice, providing preclinical evidence that astrocytic MAGL silencing represents an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.",

    "title": "Rhodopsin 7 is indispensable for regulating the firing rates of olfactory sensory neurons in response to extracellular field potential changes in Drosophila melanogaster",
    "content": "Although extracellular field potential changes are commonly observed in the nervous systems, it remains controversial if extracellular electrical activity contributes to neural processing or whether it is an epiphenomenon associated with neural activity. We previously reported that the extracellular field potential change in compound eyes in response to light stimulation induces firing rate changes in olfactory sensory neurons in female Drosophila melanogaster. Through further investigation, we found that the extracellular field potential within the olfactory sensillum is regulated by octopaminergic neurons in response to the light stimulation and that rhodopsin 7 mediates the firing rate changes in the olfactory sensory neurons in response to field potential changes in a light-independent manner. Structural analysis suggests a voltage-dependent gating mechanism for rhodopsin 7 to respond to the field potential change. This study reveals that the nervous system actively controls the field potential in response to sensory input, resulting in alteration of behavioral patterns as well as neural firing patterns in a context-dependent manner.",

    "title": "Early death and neuronal abnormalities in depdc5 loss-of-function mosaic zebrafish models",
    "content": "Abstract DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) encodes a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Variants in DEPDC5 are associated with a range of focal epilepsies, including mosaic variants associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and other focal brain malformations with brain-only somatic mosaic variants. To investigate the role of DEPDC5 in human epilepsy related to mosaic variants, we have generated mosaic depdc5 loss-of-function zebrafish models using homology-based constructs acutely targeting depdc5 and labeled with tdTomato to allow for visualization of the degree of mosaicism. The resulting mosaic depdc5 CRISPants demonstrated early larval death, with ~50% of CRISPants (vs. 10% of controls) dead by 7 days post fertilization (dpf), analogous to the early death sometimes associated with human DEPDC5-related epilepsy. We compared depdc5 CRISPants with uninjected and scrambled controls from the same clutches. Body and head size were reduced in the depdc5 CRISPants. Analysis of swimming behavior showed a striking reduction in distance traveled and maximum velocity in the depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Based on visual confirmation of mutational load, we categorized CRISPants into depdc5+ vs. depdc5++, reflecting weak vs. strong tdTomato fluorescence. We observed that depdc5++ CRISPants had increased episodes of posture loss, suggesting increased seizure-like behavior related to higher percentages of mutant cells. Local field potential recordings revealed increased neuronal hyperexcitability in depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Acridine orange staining demonstrated early apoptosis in the CRISPants vs. controls. Our mosaic depdc5 CRISPants provide a clinically relevant model to study the role of mosaic DEPDC5-related epilepsy and early death.",

    "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) confers the greatest genetic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). With APOE4 broadly expressed in the brain, its cell-type-specific roles in AD pathogenesis are only beginning to be defined. Here, we show that neuronal APOE4 expression drives damaging lipid accumulation in hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with preferential buildup of peroxidized lipids in microglia in a tauopathy mouse model. Neuron-specific removal of APOE4 abolished this lipid phenotype, whereas neuron-specific expression of APOE4 was sufficient to recapitulate it, demonstrating that neuronal APOE4 is both necessary and sufficient for lipid accumulation. Strikingly, the association between lipid burden, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration was strongest in mice with neuron-specific APOE4 expression. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed neuronal APOE4-vulnerable neuron populations, as well as enrichment of disease-associated microglia and oligodendrocytes, all promoting lipid pathology. Primary mouse co-culture experiments showed that neuronal APOE4 drives microglial lipid accumulation via contact-dependent mechanisms involving uptake of lipids from neurons and oligodendrocytes. These findings establish neuronal APOE4 as a key driver of lipid accumulation via neuron-oligodendrocyte-microglia interactions, providing mechanistic insight into APOE4-driven lipid pathology in AD.",

    "content": "Sleep is a universal behavior that is critical for brain function and physiological homeostasis. While growing epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests reduced sleep quality is associated with negative health outcomes, the causal relationship between sleep loss and reduced longevity remains poorly understood. Here, we examine sleep across the lifespan and its relationship to longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We examined the associations between numerous components of sleep at different life stages to longevity. Early life sleep, but not middle and late-life sleep, was positively associated with longevity. Age-dependent changes in sleep were consistent but accelerated, when flies are housed under stressful conditions including nutrient and temperature stress. Further, pharmacological restoration of sleep in the first 10 days of life, but not at later time points, increases longevity. Together, this work provides a systematic investigation of how different components of sleep impact longevity and suggests early life sleep may be particularly important in promoting sleep across the lifespan.",

    "title": "Show HN: Detail, a Bug Finder",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, tl;dr we built a bug finder that's working really well, especially for app backends. Try it out and send us your thoughts!<p>Long story below.<p>--------------------------<p>We originally set out to work on technical debt. We had all seen codebases with a lot of debt, so we had personal grudges about the problem, and AI seemed to be making it a lot worse.<p>Tech debt also seemed like a great problem for AI because: 1) a small portion of the work is thinky and strategic, and then the bulk of the execution is pretty mechanical, and 2) when you're solving technical debt, you're usually trying to preserve existing behavior, just change the implementation. That means you can treat it as a closed-loop problem if you figure out good ways to detect unintended behavior changes due to a code change. And we know how to do that \u2013 that's what tests are for!<p>So we started with writing tests. Tests create the guardrails that make future code changes safer. Our thinking was: if we can test well enough, we can automate a lot of other tech debt work at very high quality.<p>We built an agent that could write thousands of new tests for a typical codebase, most \"merge-quality\". Some early users merged hundreds of PRs generated this way, but intuitively the tool always felt \"good but not great\". We used it sporadically ourselves, and it usually felt like a chore.<p>Around this point we realized: while we had set out to write good tests, we had built a system that, with a few tweaks, might be very good at finding bugs. When we tested it out on some friends' codebases, we discovered that almost every repo has tons of bugs lurking in it that we were able to flag. Serious bugs, interesting enough that people dropped what they were doing to fix them. Sitting right there in peoples codebases, already merged, running in prod.<p>We also found a lot of vulns, even in mature codebases, and sometimes even right after someone had gotten a pentest.<p>Under the hood:\n- We check out a codebase and figure out how to build it for local dev and exercise it with tests.\n- We take snapshots of the built local dev state. (We use Runloop for this and are big fans.)\n- We spin up hundreds of copies of the local dev environment to exercise the codebase in thousands of ways and flag behaviors that seem wrong.\n- We pick the most salient, scary examples and deliver them as linear tickets, github issues, or emails.<p>In practice, it's working pretty well. We've been able to find bugs in everything from compilers to trading platforms (even in rust code), but the sweet spot is app backends.<p>Our approach trades compute for quality. Our codebase scans take hours, far beyond what would be practical for a code review bot. But the result is that we can make more judicious use of engineers\u2019 attention, and we think that\u2019s going to be the most important variable.<p>Longer term, we think compute is cheap, engineer attention is expensive. Wielded properly, the newest models can execute complicated changes, even in large codebases. That means the limiting reagent in building software is human attention. It still takes time and focus for an engineer to ingest information, e.g. existing code, organizational context, and product requirements. These are all necessary before an engineer can articulate what they want in precise terms and do a competent job reviewing the resulting diff.<p>For now we're finding bugs, but the techniques we're developing extend to a lot of other background, semi-proactive work to improve codebases.<p>Try it out and tell us what you think. Free first scan, no credit card required: <a href=\"https://detail.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://detail.dev/</a><p>We're also scanning on OSS repos, if you have any requests. The system is pretty high signal-to-noise, but we don't want to risk annoying maintainers by automatically opening issues, so if you request a scan for an OSS repo the results will go to you personally. <a href=\"https://detail.dev/oss\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://detail.dev/oss</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207852\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207852</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
    "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

    "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
    "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

    "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
    "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",

    "title": "Distance of bipolar re-referencing imparts nonlinear frequency-specific influences on intracranial recording signal measurements",
    "content": "Obective. Bipolar re-referencing (BPRR), in which one electrode\u2019s signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how BPRR affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. Approach. Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n = 3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10 mm, respectively. BPRR was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n = 445 305 grid, 16 004 depth, 3278 strip) spanning distances from 2\u201360 mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative interictal epileptiform discharge localization were evaluated. Main results. We identified 8 mm as a consistent reversal point for BPRR, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2\u2013200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50\u2013200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4\u201340 mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8 mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. Significance. BPRR distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8 mm and \u223c30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.",

    "title": "OpenXstim: an open-source programmable electrical stimulator for transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation therapy",
    "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

    "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
    "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

    "title": "Evaluating group interactions in epileptic brain networks by hypergraph and higher-order homophily",
    "content": "Objective. Group interactions capture cooperative dynamics among neural populations quantitatively, while also enabling precise detection of ensemble-level synchrony patterns and transcending the limitations of node-level relationships. To evaluate higher-order group interactions, we propose the PLASSO-homophily framework using multichannel stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy. Approach. Specifically, we use phase locking value to improve least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method for constructing hypergraphs. Afterwards, we calculate affinity ratios between brain zones. Finally, we investigate higher-order interactions among different groups from a homophily perspective. The extremal result of strict homophily serves as a crucial theoretical framework for understanding homophily concepts, reflecting the constraints that different groups follow in higher-order interactions. Main results. It is observed that group interactions between seizure onset zones (SOZ), propagation zones (PZ) and non-involved zones (NIZ) present significant distinction across different seizure phases. In particular, the homophily of SOZ reaches a peak point during the seizure and sharply decreases in the post-seizure, with the most statistically significant differences on and bands. Furthermore, during the seizure, SOZ-PZ exhibits enhanced coupling while SOZ-NIZ exhibits impaired functional integration. Finally, among three groups, only SOZ exhibits strict monotonic and majority homophily. Significance. By analyzing changes in in-class and out-class connectivity, we quantitatively assess the activity levels and combinatorial constraints of the SOZ, PZ, and NIZ, thereby providing a novel perspective for exploring seizure mechanisms and developing epilepsy treatments.",

    "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

    "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
    "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

    "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "title": "Launch HN: Mentat (YC S16) \u2013 Controlling LLMs with Runtime Intervention",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Cyril from CTGT. Today we\u2019re launching Mentat (<a href=\"https://api.ctgt.ai/v1/chat/completions\">https://api.ctgt.ai/v1/chat/completions</a>), an API that gives developers deterministic control over LLM behavior, steering reasoning and removing bias on the fly, without the compute of fine-tuning or the brittleness of prompt engineering. We use feature-level intervention and graph-based verification to fix hallucinations and enforce policies.<p>This resonates in highly regulated industries or otherwise risky applications of AI where the fallout from incorrect or underperforming output can be significant. In financial services, using GenAI to scan for noncompliant communications can be arduous without an easy way to embed complex policies into the model. Similarly, a media outlet might want to scale AI-generated summaries of their content, but reliability and accuracy is paramount. These are both applications where Fortune 500 companies have utilized our technology to improve subpar performance from existing models, and we want to bring this capability to more people.<p>Here\u2019s a quick 2-minute demo video showing the process: <a href=\"https://video.ctgt.ai/video/ctgt-ai-compliance-playground-cfnl\">https://video.ctgt.ai/video/ctgt-ai-compliance-playground-cf...</a><p>Standard \"guardrails\" like RAG and system prompts are fundamentally probabilistic: you are essentially asking the model nicely to behave. This often fails in two ways. First, RAG solves knowledge <i>availability</i> but not <i>integration</i>. In our benchmarks, a model given context that \"Lerwick is 228 miles SE of T\u00f3rshavn\" failed to answer \"What is 228 miles NW of Lerwick?\" because it couldn't perform the spatial inversion.<p>Second, prompt engineering is brittle because it fights against the model's pre-training priors. For example, on the TruthfulQA benchmark, base models fail ~80% of the time because they mimic common misconceptions found on the internet (e.g. \"chameleons change color for camouflage\"). We found that we could literally turn up the feature for \"skeptical reasoning\" to make the model ignore the popular myth and output the scientific fact. This matters because for high-stakes use cases (like Finance or Pharma), \"mostly safe\" isn't acceptable\u2014companies need audit-grade reliability.<p>Our work stems from the CS dungeon at UCSD, with years spent researching efficient and interpretable AI, trying to \"open the black box\" of neural networks. We realized that the industry was trying to patch model behavior from the outside (prompts/filters) when the problem was on the inside (feature activations). We knew this was important when we saw enterprises struggling to deploy basic models despite having unlimited compute, simply because they couldn't guarantee the output wouldn't violate compliance rules. I ended up leaving my research at Stanford to focus on this.<p>Our breakthrough came while researching the DeepSeek-R1 model. We identified the \"censorship\" feature vector in its latent space. Amplifying it guaranteed refusal; subtracting it instantly unlocked answers to sensitive questions. This proved the model <i>had</i> the knowledge but was suppressing it. We realized we could apply this same logic to hallucinations, suppressing \"confabulation\" features to reveal the grounded truth. While some hallucinations stem from the inherent randomness of generative models, many can be identified with the concerted activation of a feature or group of features.<p>Instead of filtering outputs, we intervene at the activation level during the forward pass. We identify latent feature vectors (v) associated with specific behaviors (bias, misconception) and mathematically modify the hidden state (h):<p><pre><code>  h_prime = h - alpha * (h @ v) * v\n</code></pre>\nThis arithmetic operation lets us \"edit\" behavior deterministically with negligible overhead (<10ms on R1). For factual claims, we combine this with a graph verification pipeline (which works on closed weight models). We check semantic entropy (is the model babbling?) and cross-reference claims against a dynamic knowledge graph to catch subtle relational hallucinations that vector search misses.<p>On GPT-OSS-120b, this approach improved TruthfulQA accuracy from 21% to 70% by suppressing misconception features. We also improved the performance of this model to frontier levels on HaluEval-QA, where we reached 96.5% accuracy, solving the spatial reasoning failures where the baseline failed. It also handles noisy inputs, inferring \"David Icke\" from the typo \"David Of me\" where base models gave up. Full benchmarks at <a href=\"https://ctgt.ai/benchmarks\">https://ctgt.ai/benchmarks</a>.<p>Most startups in this space are observability tools that tell you only after the model failed. Or they are RAG pipelines that stuff context into the window. Mentat is an infrastructure layer that modifies the model's processing during inference. We fix the reasoning, not just the context. For example, that\u2019s how our system was able to enforce that if A is SE of B, then B is NW of A.<p>We believe that our policy engine is a superior control mechanism to RAG or prompting. If you\u2019re frustrated with current guardrails, we\u2019d love it if you would stress-test our API!<p>API: Our endpoint is drop-in compatible with OpenAI\u2019s /v1/chat/completions: <a href=\"https://docs.ctgt.ai/api-reference/endpoint/chat-completions\">https://docs.ctgt.ai/api-reference/endpoint/chat-completions</a><p>Playground: We\u2019ve built an \"Arena\" view to run side-by-side comparisons of an Ungoverned vs. Governed model to visualize the intervention delta in real-time. No signup is required: <a href=\"https://playground.ctgt.ai/\">https://playground.ctgt.ai/</a><p>We\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the approach and see what edge cases you can find that break standard models. We will be in the comments all day. All feedback welcome!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207017\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207017</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Software and pipelines for registration and analyses of rodent brain image data in reference atlas space",
    "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",
